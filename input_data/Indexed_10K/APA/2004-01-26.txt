SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted for a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2002. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Apache common stock, par value $0.625 per share, is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange under the symbol APA. The table below provides certain information regarding our common stock for 2002 and 2001. Prices were obtained from the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Reporting System; however, the per share prices and dividends shown in the following table have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split and the 10 percent and five percent stock dividends, all of which are described below. Per share prices and dividends shown below have been rounded to the indicated decimal place. 2002 2001 PRICE RANGE DIVIDENDS PER SHARE PRICE RANGE DIVIDENDS PER SHARE HIGH LOW DECLARED PAID HIGH LOW DECLARED PAID First Quarter......... $27.72 $21.13 $.0475 $.0475 $31.55 $23.47 $ $ Second Quarter........ 28.62 25.04 .0475 .0475 28.92 20.80 Third Quarter......... 28.57 21.46 .0475 .0475 23.55 16.56 .121 Fourth Quarter........ 28.88 23.55 .0475 .0475 23.87 17.57 .0475 .121 The closing price per share of our common stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Reporting System for February 28, 2003, was $65.28 ($31.09 adjusted for the five percent stock dividend and two for one stock split). At February 28, 2003, there were 153,850,136 shares of our common stock outstanding (323,085,284 shares adjusted for the five percent stock dividend and two for one stock split) held by approximately 8,000 shareholders of record and approximately 104,000 beneficial owners. We have paid cash dividends on our common stock for 36 consecutive years through December 31, 2002. During 2000, we implemented a change in the payment schedule for dividends on our common stock from a quarterly basis to an annual basis; however, we later implemented a return to a quarterly dividend payment 15 schedule beginning in 2002. When, and if, declared by our board of directors, future dividend payments will depend upon our level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. In 1995, our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan to replace the former plan adopted in 1986. Under our stockholder rights plan, each of our common stockholders received a dividend of one "preferred stock purchase right" for each 2.31 outstanding shares of common stock (adjusted for the 10 percent and five percent stock dividends and two for one stock split) that the stockholder owned. We refer to these preferred stock purchase rights as the "rights." Unless the rights have been previously redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock are issued with rights. The rights trade automatically with our shares of common stock. Certain triggering events will give the holders of the rights the ability to purchase shares of our common stock, or the equivalent stock of a person that acquires us, at a discount. The triggering events relate to persons or groups acquiring an amount of our common stock in excess of a set percentage, or attempting to or actually acquiring us. The details of how the rights operate are set out in our certificate of incorporation and the Rights Agreement, dated January 31, 1996, between Apache and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A. (formerly Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A.). Both of those documents have been filed as exhibits to this Form 10 K and you should review them to fully understand the effects of the rights. The purpose of the rights is to encourage potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors before attempting a takeover bid and to provide our board of directors with leverage in negotiating on behalf of our stockholders the terms of any proposed takeover. The rights may have certain anti takeover effects. They should not, however, interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by our board of directors. In May 1999, we issued 140,000 shares of 6.5 percent Automatically Convertible Equity Securities, Conversion Preferred Stock, Series C (Series C Preferred Stock) in the form of seven million depositary shares each representing 1/50th of a share of Series C Preferred Stock. The depositary shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange. The Series C Preferred Stock was not subject to a sinking fund or mandatory redemption. In 2000, Apache bought back 75,900 depositary shares at an average price of $34.42 per share. The excess of the purchase price to reacquire the depositary shares over the original issuance price, $330,000, is reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations. The remaining depositary shares converted into 6,554,865 shares (13,109,730 shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of Apache common stock in 2002. On September 13, 2001, our board of directors declared a 10 percent dividend on our shares of common stock payable in common stock on January 21, 2002 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2001. Pursuant to the terms of the declared 10 percent stock dividend, we issued 13,070,068 shares (26,140,136 shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of our common stock on January 21, 2002 to the holders of the 130,888,270 shares (261,776,540 shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock outstanding on December 31, 2001. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the stock dividend and cash payments totaling $891,132 were made in lieu of fractional shares. On December 18, 2002, our board of directors declared a five percent dividend on our shares of common stock payable in common stock on April 2, 2003 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. Pursuant to the terms of the declared five percent stock dividend, we expect to issue approximately 7,868,000 shares (15,736,000 shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of our common stock on April 2, 2003 to the holders of the 153,867,875 shares (307,735,750 shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock outstanding on March 12, 2003. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the stock dividend and we expect to make cash payments totaling approximately $1,437,000 in lieu of fractional shares. On January 22, 2003, in conjunction with the BP acquisition, the Company completed the public offering of 9.9 million shares (19.8 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of Apache common stock, including 1.3 million shares (2.6 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) for the underwriters over allotment option, at $58.10 per share ($29.05 adjusted for the two for one stock split). Net proceeds after placement fees totaled approximately $554 million. The proceeds were used to repay indebtedness under our commercial paper program and money market lines of credit and to invest in short term treasury only money market funds and treasury notes to hold funds for the BP acquisition. 16 On September 11, 2003 our board of directors declared a two for one stock split, which was distributed on January 14, 2004 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2003.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW In 2002, Apache reported another very satisfactory year of growth and progress in our mission to build Apache incrementally to last. We finished the year with strong results, the third best year on a per share basis over our 48 year history. Our strong cash flow provided us the flexibility to make necessary and appropriate investments in continuation of our long term incremental growth strategy. On the back of a strong fourth quarter, we ended the year with a solid $544 million of net income attributable to common stock and $1.4 billion in cash from operating activities. We exited 2002 with our best quarter of the year and a strong financial position. Thirteen days into the new year, we announced the acquisition of $1.3 billion (subject to normal closing adjustments and the exercise of preferential rights by third parties) in properties from BP p.l.c. (BP), setting the stage for an exciting 2003. 17 Facing 2002 with the prospect of continued volatility in commodity prices, high service costs (including drilling, materials and contracted geophysical surveys) and unattractive acquisition prices, we exercised patience and discipline, restricting capital spending and focusing efforts on maintaining our competitive position by strengthening our balance sheet, growing our reserve base and maintaining production levels. As the year progressed, improving commodity prices and declining drilling costs placed us in an ideal position where we could continue increasing financial flexibility while simultaneously increasing capital spending, which we did beginning in the third quarter. Our worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling of $860 million were 46 percent higher than our initial plan, but still well below the $1.3 billion we spent in 2001. Ultimately, this strategy manifested itself in lower drilling costs, one of the lowest debt to capitalization ratios in our peer group, and our 17th consecutive year of reserve growth, ending with 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. It also left us positioned to acquire the BP properties in 2003 while maintaining our financial flexibility. Our capital expenditure reductions in the first half of 2002 were selective, both by region and by type of drilling. Rather than decrease exploration drilling, we increased it in the areas of Canada, Egypt, and Australia, all core producing areas that saw production growth in 2002. We had a successful exploration drilling program in 2002, reporting 16 discoveries worldwide. Production remained within one percent of prior year levels despite our capital spending curtailment in the first half of the year and back to back hurricanes, which forced us to shut in all of our Gulf of Mexico production for a brief period in late September and then again in early October. The foundation of Apaches strategy is a portfolio approach that was developed to provide diversity in terms of hydrocarbon product (oil or gas), geologic risk and geographic location. In 2002, 58 percent of our equivalent production came from outside the U.S., up from 51 percent in 2001. At year end 2002, our reserves were 49 percent oil and 51 percent gas, compared with 47 percent and 53 percent at year end 2001. In each of our core producing areas, our front line teams have the technical knowledge, sense of urgency and drive necessary to wring more value from Apaches assets. Building local expertise also provides a platform to compete and expand in our core areas through both operations and acquisitions. In the latter half of 2001, we felt that acquisition prices had reached exorbitant levels, relative to commodity prices, leading us to the sidelines until appropriate opportunities arose at reasonable prices, which began late in 2002. We spent approximately $355 million on acquisitions in 2002, compared with $1.2 billion in 2001 and $1.4 billion in 2000. The most significant of the 2002 activity came in December, when we announced the acquisition of properties in South Louisiana. As we have done in the past, and what has become a cornerstone of our acquisition strategy, we entered into hedges to protect the economics of the transaction, while at the same time preserving the potential for significantly higher gas realizations. See Note 4, in Item 15 of this Form 10 K. In January 2003, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with BP to purchase producing properties in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico for $1.3 billion (subject to normal closing adjustments and the exercise of preferential rights by third parties), the largest single acquisition in Apaches history. The acquisition from BP is significant in many respects: it extends our relationship to one of the worlds premier integrated major oil companies; it adds production and reserves and a new exploitation portfolio in North Americas strongest gas market; and it establishes a new core area in the North Sea, which fits our balanced portfolio business model and further diversifies our reserves and production. The Gulf properties are synergistic with our existing properties and made Apache the fourth largest producer and the second largest acreage holder in Gulf of Mexico waters to 1,200 feet deep. We will also become the ninth largest oil producer in the North Sea. The effective date of the transaction is January 1, 2003; the Gulf portion closed on March 13, 2003; the North Sea portion is projected to close early in the second quarter. The acquisition is being financed through a combination of internally generated funds, the issuance in January 2003 of common equity, and debt. Oil and gas production for the first two years has been hedged to provide Apache with fixed prices on expected production to protect against commodity price volatility (see Note 4 of Item 15 in this Form 10 K). On January 22, 2003, in conjunction with the BP transaction, we completed a public offering of 9.9 million shares (19.8 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock, including 18 1.3 million shares (2.6 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) for the underwriters over allotment option, raising net proceeds of $554 million. After announcing the BP acquisition, all three rating agencies reaffirmed Apaches single A credit ratings, a testament to our strong financial position, our conservative financial strategy, where we employ hedges to protect acquisition economics, and our three pronged approach to finance large scale transactions with internally generated funds, equity and debt. We believe that this reaffirmation of our credit ratings further establishes Apaches financial wherewithal and reputation as a reliable purchaser of major companies assets as they sell assets in the future. In December 2002, to recognize the Companys continued progress on both the financial and operational fronts, Apaches board of directors declared a special five percent common stock dividend payable on April 2, 2003, to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. On September 11, 2003, our board of directors declared a two for one stock split, which was distributed on January 14, 2004 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2003. All of the share and per share information included in this filing has been adjusted to reflect this stock dividend and the two for one stock split except where otherwise indicated. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. See Results of Operations and Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management. FULL COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful efforts method, cost such as geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method the net book value (full cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. We have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the 19 benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. As a result, we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments. The Company has taken note of a July 2003 inquiry to the Financial Accounting Standards Board regarding whether or not contract based oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contract ("mineral rights") should be recorded or disclosed as intangible assets. The inquiry presents a view that these mineral rights are intangible assets as defined in SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and, therefore, should be classified separately on the balance sheet as intangible assets. SFAS No. 141, and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became effective for transactions subsequent to June 30, 2001 with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 142 required as of January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets. Under the statement, intangible assets should be separately reported on the face of the balance sheet and accompanied by disclosure in the notes to financial statements. SFAS No. 142 scopes out accounting utilized by the oil and gas industry as prescribed by SFAS No. 19, and is silent about whether or not its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas companies. Apache does not believe that SFAS No. 141 or 142 change the classification of oil and gas mineral rights and the Company continues to classify these assets as part of oil and gas properties. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) has added the treatment of oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda, which may result in a change in how Apache classifies these assets. Should such a change be required, the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after June 30, 2001 that would be classified as "intangible undeveloped mineral interest" was $9 million and $78 million as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after June 30, 2001 that would be classified as "intangible developed mineral interest" was $88 million and $332 million as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Intangible developed mineral interest amounts are presented net of accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A). Accumulated DD&A was estimated using historical depletion rates applied proportionately to the costs of the acquisitions to be classified as "intangible developed mineral interest". The amounts noted above only include mineral rights acquired in business combinations or major asset purchases, and exclude those acquired individually or in groups as we have not historically tracked these in this manner. The Company has also not historically tracked the amount of mineral rights in the proved property balances related to producing leases or relinquished leases. We are currently identifying a methodology to do so for transactions subsequent to June 30, 2001. The numbers above are based on our understanding of the issue before the EITF, if all mineral rights associated with unevaluated property and producing reserves were deemed to be intangible assets: mineral rights with proved reserves that were acquired after June 30, 2001 and mineral rights with no proved reserves would be classified as intangible assets and would not be included in oil and gas properties on our consolidated balance sheet; results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected because mineral rights would continue to be amortized in accordance with full cost accounting rules; and disclosures required by SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 relative to intangibles would be included in the notes to our financial statements. If the accounting for mineral rights is ultimately changed, transitional guidance for intangible assets permits the reclassification of only amounts acquired after the effective date of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 if records were not previously maintained to track acquisition costs based on their intangible or tangible nature. Lack of these records prior to the effective date could result in the loss of comparability between historical balances of tangible and intangible asset balances and among companies in the industry. 20 RESERVE ESTIMATES Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a "ceiling" limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, their review covered 68, 61 and 72 percent of the reserve value, respectively. BAD DEBT EXPENSE We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties of which we are the operator. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings. Generally, our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months. In Egypt, however, we have experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Deteriorating economic conditions during 2001 and 2002 in Egypt have lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in an additional one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. Continuation of the hard currency shortage in Egypt could lead to further delays, deferrals of payment or non payment in the future. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Under the full cost method of accounting, as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections, the estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations, net of salvage, are currently included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." Apache adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as discussed in Note 2 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. SFAS No. 143 significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets ("asset retirement obligations" or "ARO"). Primarily, the new statement requires the Company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the Companys asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. 21 Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations. SFAS No. 143 requires a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception. The Company, therefore, calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the ARO liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance. The sum of these cumulative expenses was compared to the depletion expense originally recorded. Because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under SFAS No. 143, the difference resulted in a gain which the Company recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. Upon implementation, the Company also had to determine if the statement required us to recalculate our historical full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K). The Company chose not to re calculate its historical full cost ceiling tests even though its historical oil and gas property balances would have been higher had we applied the statement from inception. We believe this approach is appropriate because SFAS No. 143 is silent on this issue and was not effective during the prior impairment test periods. Had a recalculation of the historical full cost ceiling test resulted in impairment, the charge would have reduced the gain recorded upon adoption. Going forward, our depletion expense will be reduced since we will deplete a discounted ARO rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted. The lower depletion expense under SFAS No. 143 is offset, however, by higher accretion expense, which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time. Also going forward, the Company had to determine how to incorporate the asset retirement obligations into the quarterly calculation of its full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K). SFAS No. 143 is silent with respect to this issue and, although there are various views, the Company elected to continue including the undiscounted ARO as part of future development costs, essentially reducing the present value of its future net revenues and full cost ceiling limit. To compare the property balance, which included the ARO component, to the full cost ceiling limit, which has been reduced by a similar abandonment cost, we netted the ARO liability against the property balance. The Company believes its view is appropriate since there must be a comparable basis between the net book value of the properties and the full cost ceiling limitation. Another widely contemplated view is to exclude the ARO from future development costs when calculating the full cost ceiling limitation and not reduce the carrying amount of capitalized costs by the related liability. This approach would result in a higher full cost ceiling limitation and a higher net oil and gas property balance. INCOME TAXES Oil and gas exploration and production is a global business. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). We intend to permanently reinvest earnings from our international operations; therefore, we do not recognize deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, we would then reflect taxes on those earnings. 22 DERIVATIVES Apache uses commodity derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. Apache accounts for its commodity derivative contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133). Realized gains and losses from the Companys cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, are generally recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. SFAS 133 requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be reported in current period income, rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. This may result in significant volatility to current period income. SFAS 133 is complex and subject to a potentially wide range of interpretations in its application. As such, in 1998 the FASB established the Derivative Implementation Group (DIG) task force specifically to consider and to publish official interpretations of issues arising from the implementation of SFAS 133. The potential exists for additional issues to be brought under review, therefore, if subsequent interpretations of SFAS 133 are different than our current policy, it is possible that our policy, as stated above, would be modified. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section includes a discussion of our 2002 and 2001 results of operations. Apache has five reportable segments, which are the United States, Canada, Australia, Egypt and Other International. These segments are primarily in the business of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Please refer to Note 14 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for segment information. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES In 2002, we elected to exercise patience on the acquisition front, waiting for the frenzy that drove acquisition prices to unreasonable levels to ebb. We focused our attention on managing our financial structure by building equity and paying down debt so we would be in a position to act quickly when attractive assets became available at reasonable prices. Our oil and gas acquisitions in 2002 totaled approximately $350 million, adding 49 MMboe to our reserve base, far short of the $880 million and $1.3 billion we expended during 2001 and 2000, respectively, which added 213 MMboe and 254 MMboe of proved reserves. In addition, the acquisitions added $3 million, $146 million and $94 million of production, processing and transportation facilities in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and $197 million of goodwill in 2001. These acquisitions strengthened our position in core areas and provided promising prospects for future exploration and development activities. We will continue our strategy of finding additional reserves on the acquired properties and accelerating the production of those already identified while endeavoring to lower costs. Seventy five percent of our 2002 acquisition activity occurred in the U.S. and was related to the acquisition of properties primarily located in two Southern Louisiana parishes. The balance of our 2002 acquisitions primarily related to two acquisitions in Canada. In connection with our 2002 South Louisiana acquisition, we entered into costless collar hedges to protect Apache from the potential for falling gas prices and to protect the economics of the transaction. These hedges are consistent with some of our 2001 and 2000 acquisitions whereby we entered into and assumed fixed price commodity swaps and costless collars that protected Apache from falling commodity prices. This enabled us to better predict the financial performance of our acquisitions. See Note 4 of Item 15 for the terms of the Companys hedging activity. Over ninety percent of our 2001 activity was spent on three acquisitions, one in Canada and two in Egypt. The Fletcher acquisition in Canada totaled 55 percent while the Repsol and Novus acquisitions in Egypt totaled 37 percent of our acquisition activity. All three acquisitions added significant reserves and production. Over ninety percent of our 2000 activity involved four North American transactions, three in the U.S. and one in Canada. The U.S. acquisitions, which totaled 56 percent of our acquisition outlays, included properties acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Collins & Ware, Inc. and Repsol YPF. Our Canadian 23 acquisition from Phillips Petroleum Company represented 36 percent of the years activity. These four transactions added significant reserves and production. Our acquisitions over the last three years helped us maintain diversity in terms of hydrocarbon product (oil or gas), geologic risk and geographic location. As shown in Note 15 of this Form 10 K, our 2002 year end international reserves as a percentage of total reserves climbed to 52 percent from 41 percent at year end 2000. Similarly, our international average daily production in 2002 rose to 58 percent of our total production versus 41 percent in 2000. Our hydrocarbon product mix on a boe basis has remained relatively constant at 53 percent natural gas and 47 percent oil. While the U.S., a highly stable environment, remains our largest core area, Apache will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in existing core areas and in new areas should they arise. Note that, in light of the uncertainty of how the collapse of Enron Corp. would impact the derivatives markets, we closed all of our derivatives positions in October and November 2001, most of which were associated with prior acquisitions, recognizing a net gain of $10 million. A net gain of $24 million was recognized in 2002 and a $4 million net loss will be recognized in 2003 as the originally hedged volumes are produced. These, as well as the unwinding of our gas price swaps associated with advances from gas purchasers, increased the Companys average natural gas price by $.04 per Mcf during 2002, $.09 per Mcf during 2001 and $.05 per Mcf during 2000. They increased our average crude oil price by $.15 per bbl during 2002, and reduced our average crude oil price by $.42 per bbl during 2001 and $1.62 per bbl during 2000. We routinely evaluate our property portfolio and divest those that are marginal or no longer fit into our strategic growth program. We divested $7 million, $348 million and $26 million of properties during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. REVENUES Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on the prices we receive for our production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while economic factors such as the current U.S. recession could impact demand. Oil and Natural Gas Prices While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a world wide market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions. Apache sells its natural gas into three markets: 1) North America, which has a common market and where production is currently in short supply relative to demand. 2) Australia, which has a local market with limited demand and infrastructure. 3) Egypt, which has a local market and where the price received for the majority of our production is currently indexed to a weighted average Dated Brent crude oil price. For specific marketing arrangements by segment, please refer to Item 1, Business of this Form 10 K. Contributions to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues As with production and reserves, a consequence of geographic diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues and natural gas revenues. For the reasons discussed in the Oil and Natural Gas Price section above, contributions to oil revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately. 24 The following table presents each segments oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues, respectively. OIL REVENUES GAS REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 United States..................... 35% 40% 47% 51% 61% 72% Canada............................ 16% 17% 13% 29% 27% 16% North America..................... 51% 57% 60% 80% 88% 88% Egypt............................. 29% 27% 25% 15% 8% 7% Australia......................... 20% 16% 15% 5% 4% 5% Other International............... Total........................... 100% 100% 100% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% Crude Oil Contribution In 2002, oil revenues outside the U.S. reached approximately 65 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 60 percent in 2001. This increase primarily occurred in Egypt and Australia where crude oil revenues rose to 28 percent and 20 percent of total oil revenues, respectively. Canada contributed 16 percent of oil revenue, down from 17 percent in 2001. In 2001, oil revenues outside the U.S. totaled 60 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 53 percent in 2000. This increase was spread among Egypt, Canada and Australia. Egypts contribution totaled 27 percent, while Canada and Australia contributed 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Natural Gas Contribution The preponderance of consolidated natural gas revenues come from our North American operations. In 2002, 80 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from the North American market, 51 percent from the U.S. and 29 percent from Canada. The remaining 20 percent was split between Egypt, 15 percent, and Australia, 5 percent. In 2001, 88 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from the North American market, 61 percent from the U.S. and 27 percent from Canada. The remaining natural gas revenues were primarily split between Egypt, 8 percent, and Australia, 3 percent. 25 The table below presents oil and gas production revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids.

The price decline reduced revenues by $342 million, while lower gas production reduced revenues by another $49 million. A gas production decline of 18 percent was experienced in the U.S., with declines of 21 percent and 13 percent in the Gulf Coast and Central regions respectively. The Gulf Coast region, which contributed 61.5% of Apaches U.S. 2002 production, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial rates followed by steep declines when compared to other U.S. producing regions. This attribute coupled with capital curtailments, property sales in late 2001 and back to back hurricanes in September and October 2002 contributed to the production decline in the U.S. Collectively, Canada, Egypt, Australia and Argentina saw a 13 percent increase in natural gas production. Canadas increase was the result of previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity, coupled with successful results at Ladyfern, which offset natural decline at Zama. Egypts increase also came from previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. A 36 percent increase in our natural gas production contributed $390 million to 2001 revenues. Canadas increase was primarily driven by our acquisition of producing properties from Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) in December 2000 and Fletcher Challenge in March 2001 as well as strong exploration and development results from the Ladyfern area. A full year of production from the properties we acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) in August 2000 and Collins & Ware, Inc. (Collins & Ware) in June 2000 helped boost our domestic production by 13 percent, while properties acquired from Repsol helped double our Egyptian production. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. We have used long term, fixed price physical contracts to lock in a small portion of our domestic future natural gas production. The contracts provide protection to the Company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices and represented approximately 11 percent of our 2002 and 2001 domestic natural gas production. In 2002, these contracts positively impacted our average realized price by $.01 per Mcf. Historically high prices in the first half of 2001 resulted in a negative impact of $.06 per Mcf in that year. Additionally, substantially all of our natural gas production sold in Australia is subject to long term fixed price contracts. Crude Oil Revenues Oil revenues improved $137 million in 2002 with both a higher realized price and higher production. The weighted average realized price for oil improved $1.60 per barrel, adding $86 million to oil revenues, while oil production gains added another $51 million. The price improvement was across the board, while production gains of 29 percent and 12 percent occurred in Australia and Egypt, respectively. The Legendre, Simpson and Gibson/South Plato developments drove Australias gain, while Egypts increase was related to the Repsol acquisition and subsequent drilling. U.S. production declined nine percent related to natural decline, back to back hurricanes in late September and early October and property sales. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. Our crude oil revenues increased in 2001 despite a 15 percent drop in the average realized price, as crude oil production increased 29 percent. The acquisition and subsequent exploitation of properties acquired from Repsol, in March 2001, contributed to a 41 percent increase in our year over year Egyptian production. Strong results on properties acquired from Fletcher Challenge in March 2001 and Phillips in December 2000 helped us increase our Canadian oil production by 76 percent. We also had success on the drilling front, increasing our Australian production by nearly 51 percent with successful development of the Legendre, Gipsy/North Gipsy and Simpson fields. 27 OPERATING EXPENSES The table below presents a detail of our expenses. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 (IN MILLIONS) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment........................ $ 784 $ 760 $ 548 Other assets.............................................. 60 61 36 International impairments................................... 20 65 Lease operating costs....................................... 462 405 254 Gathering and transportation costs.......................... 38 35 19 Severance and other taxes................................... 63 70 59 General and administrative expenses......................... 105 89 76 Financing costs, net........................................ 113 118 106 Total.................................................. $1,645 $1,603 $1,098 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Apaches full cost DD&A expense is driven by many factors including certain costs incurred in the exploration, development, and acquisition of producing reserves, production levels, and estimates of proved reserve quantities and future developmental costs. In 2002, our full cost DD&A expense increased $24 million. Areas outside the U.S. saw an increase in their expense, while DD&A expense decreased in the U.S. The areas experiencing the largest increase in absolute costs were Egypt, up $29 million and Australia, up $24 million (consistent with their overall increase in production), while the U.S. experienced a $39 million decline in full cost DD&A expense on lower production levels. Canada also had higher DD&A expense of $7 million relating to higher production levels. On a boe basis our 2002 full cost DD&A rate rose $.24 to $6.29. The U.S. contributed $.13 to the increase in rate, driven by higher finding costs and higher future development costs. The remaining increase in the consolidated rate is split between Egypt and Australia. The impact from Egypt is related to higher finding and development costs. The impact from Australia is primarily related to higher future development costs. In 2001, our full cost DD&A expense increased $212 million. The higher expense was spread among Canada, up $87 million, the U.S., up $63 million, Egypt, up $43 million and Australia, up $19 million, which is consistent with their overall increase in production. On a boe basis our 2001 full cost DD&A rate rose $.30 to $6.05. The U.S. contributed two thirds to the increase in rate, related to higher finding costs and negative reserve revisions associated with declining prices. Canada contributed $.04 to the increase in the overall rate, reflecting the impact of higher future development costs. Australia also contributed $.04 to the increase in the overall rate, reflecting higher future development costs during 2001. Depreciation on other assets remained flat in 2002 after increasing $25 million in 2001 associated with additional facilities acquired in March 2001 from Fletcher in Canada, and Repsol in Egypt, and the amortization of goodwill. In connection with the adoption of a new accounting principle effective January 1, 2002, we no longer amortize our goodwill. Instead, it is assessed for periodic impairment, as discussed in the impairment section below. Impairments We periodically assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment based on geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of acreage. When an impairment occurs, costs associated with these 28 properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. In some of our international exploration plays, however, we have not yet established proved reserves. As such, any impairments in these areas are immediately charged to earnings. During 2001, we impaired a portion of our unproved property costs in Poland and China by $65 million ($41 million after tax). In 2002, we impaired an additional $20 million in Poland ($12 million after tax). At December 31, 2002, the Company had $13 million of unproved property costs remaining in Poland. We are continuing to evaluate our operations in Poland, which may result in additional impairments in 2003. Goodwill is subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment beginning in 2002. Goodwill totals $189 million at December 31, 2002 and no impairment was recorded in 2002. For further discussion, see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Lease Operating Costs Lease operating costs (LOE) is generally comprised of several components; direct operating costs, repair and maintenance costs, workover costs and ad valorem costs. LOE is driven in part by the type of commodity produced, the level of workover activity and the geographical location of the properties. Oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy. They enable us to exploit our existing reserves by accelerating production and taking advantage of high pricing environments. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with plants and facilities. During 2002, LOE was $3.71 per boe, a $.49 increase from 2001. Higher absolute costs accounted for 94 percent, $.46 per boe, of this rate increase, with lower production accounting for the remaining $.03 per boe. We experienced higher absolute costs in the Gulf Coast region, Egypt and Canada. In the Gulf Coast region increased repairs and maintenance, related to both routine operations and hurricane repairs, generally higher costs on properties operated by others on offshore Gulf of Mexico properties and increased workover activity in the region, contributed to higher LOE. In Egypt, higher workover activity on the Khalda, South Umbarka and East Bahariya concessions drove up LOE. In Canada, the increased costs reflect the impact of the Fletcher, Conoco and Burlington acquisitions, which carry higher production costs than our other operations, and increased workover activity, with the heaviest activity at House Mountain, Hatton, Zama and Simonette fields. In 2001, LOE was $3.22 per boe, a $.56 increase from 2000. This increase was driven by our acquisitions of Canadian and offshore Gulf of Mexico oil properties, higher service costs and increased workover activity in the U.S. and Canada. Gathering and Transportation Costs During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." Prior to adoption, amounts paid to third parties for transportation had been reported as a reduction of revenue instead of an increase in operating expenses. Recent property acquisitions and their associated transportation arrangements have increased the significance of transportation costs paid to third parties. For comparative purposes, previously reported transportation costs paid to third parties were reclassified as corresponding increases to oil and gas production revenues and operating expenses with no impact on income attributable to common stock. These costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our North American operations. In 2002, the costs totaled $21 million in Canada and $17 million in the U.S., relatively flat to the prior year. In 2001, these costs totaled $19 million in Canada and $16 million in the U.S., up from $12 million in Canada and $8 million in the U.S. The increase over the 2000 period is related to higher volumes subject to such rates, principally from properties acquired from Fletcher in Canada, and Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation in August 2000. 29 Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes are comprised primarily of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia. In both 2002 and 2001, these severance taxes, which are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, represented over 80 percent of the total severance and other taxes expense incurred in each period. The other tax component is primarily made up of the Australian Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), to which Apache first became subject in 2002, and the Canadian Large Corporation Tax, Saskatchewan Capital Tax and Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. Oil and gas production revenues generated from Egypt and Canada are not subject to severance taxes. In 2002, severance and other taxes totaled $63 million, comprised of U.S., $35 million, Australia, $23 million and Canada, $5 million. Overall, severance and other taxes decreased $7 million. A $14 million decline in U.S. severance taxes, and a $3 million decline in Canada Saskatchewan Resource Surtax were partially offset by initial PRRT of $4 million and a $7 million increase in Australian severance taxes. The decrease in U.S. severance taxes reflects the impact of lower gas price realizations. The increase in Australias severance taxes was attributable to higher oil price realizations and a change in production mix as a higher portion of production was from properties in provincial waters, such as Legendre and Harriet, relative to production from federal waters. Canadas decline was primarily related to a refund of the Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. In 2001, severance and other taxes totaled $70 million ($50 million in the U.S., $12 million in Australia and $8 million in Canada). Severance and other taxes increased $11 million from the prior year. The increase related to higher severance taxes in Australia and, collectively, a $3 million increase in Canadas Large Corporation Tax and Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. The increase in Australias severance taxes was attributable to higher production driven oil and gas revenues. Canadas increase was related to properties acquired from Fletcher in March 2001 and Phillips Petroleum Company in December 2000. U.S. severance and other taxes were up $2 million over the prior year. Higher production driven oil and gas revenues and a higher effective production tax rate accounted for the majority of the increase in the U.S. Available incentives granted by the state of Oklahoma decline with rising commodity prices, increasing the effective tax rate. General and Administrative Expenses Overall, general and administrative expenses (G&A) trended higher in 2002, rising $.13 to $.84 per boe. Thirty eight percent of the increase is tied to rising medical costs, a sharp increase in premiums on business insurance policies renewed subsequent to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the addition of a sizeable political risk insurance package added in mid 2001. The remaining increase is related to non recurring employee separation costs, a consequence of our region realignment in the U.S., higher outside legal support costs related to arbitration proceedings with our gas marketer, Cinergy and litigation with Predator (see Note 11 of this Form 10 K), costs associated with the implementation of and compliance with various sections of Sarbanes Oxley, and a full year of expense related to additional staff and office costs incurred with the acquisition of Canadian subsidiaries of Fletcher during 2001. Realignment of our three U.S. regions into two involved both reassignment and reduction of personnel. All corresponding costs were expensed as incurred. During 2001 absolute G&A increased as the size of our company grew from acquisitions. However, 2001 G&A on an equivalent barrel basis declined 10 percent from 2000 to $.71 as the incremental production was added at a lower G&A rate. Financing Costs, Net Net financing costs decreased by five percent in 2002. The major components of net financing costs are interest expense and capitalized interest. Lower average debt outstanding during 2002 resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $23 million. A reduction in capitalized interest of $16 million, associated with lower unproved property balances, partially offset this decrease. Net financing costs increased 11 percent in 2001, related to higher average outstanding borrowings coupled with lower capitalized interest, partially offset by lower average effective interest rates. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2002 was 30 6.3 percent compared to 5.9 percent on December 31, 2001. The rate is higher at year end 2002 as a lower percentage of our debt is at floating rates, which carry a lower rate than fixed rate debt. OIL AND GAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 (IN THOUSANDS) Exploration and Development: United States........................................... $302,611 $ 699,180 $ 495,803 Canada.................................................. 258,191 410,345 135,627 Egypt................................................... 171,160 127,603 84,949 Australia............................................... 89,813 85,169 73,835 Other international..................................... 38,409 20,838 18,077 $860,184 $1,343,135 $ 808,291 Capitalized Interest...................................... $ 40,691 $ 56,749 $ 62,000 Gas Gathering Transmission and Processing Facilities...... $ 32,155 $ 28,759 $ 121,294 Acquisitions: Oil and gas properties.................................. $351,707 $ 880,286 $1,324,427 Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities... 2,875 146,295 94,000 Goodwill................................................ 197,200 $354,582 $1,223,781 $1,418,427 In 2002, Apache added 172.1 MMboe of proved reserves through acquisitions, drilling and revisions, replacing 138 percent of production. The preliminary capital expenditure budget for 2003 is approximately $1.3 billion (excluding acquisitions), including $850 million for North America. Preliminary North American capital expenditures include $350 million in the Gulf Coast region, $100 million in the Central region and $400 million in Canada. The Company has estimated its international capital expenditures in 2003 at $400 million. Capital expenditures will be reviewed periodically, and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions. CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS Apache paid a total of $13 million in dividends during 2002 on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998 and its Series C Preferred Stock issued in May 1999. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock were paid through May 15, 2002, when the shares automatically converted to common stock (see Note 9, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Common dividends paid during 2002 rose 61 percent to $56 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 36 consecutive years through 2002. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. CAPITAL RESOURCES Apaches primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flows. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices, drilling and acquisition costs, and cash flow. The Company has 31 historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities, debt, preferred interests of subsidiaries and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all other cash needs. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 totaled $1.4 billion, a decrease of 28 percent from 2001 driven by lower oil and gas production revenues and slightly higher operating expenses. Oil and gas production revenues fell with a 22 percent decline in gas prices, which was partially offset by a seven percent improvement in oil prices. The impact of lower gas production was partially offset by rising oil production. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2001 increased 26 percent to a record $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion in 2000. The primary reason for the increase is attributed to the additional oil and gas revenues from production on properties acquired during 2000 and 2001. DEBT At December 31, 2002, Apache had outstanding debt of $280 million under its commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit and a total of $1.9 billion of other debt. This other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years 2003 through 2096. Based on our current plan for capital spending and projections of debt and interest rates, interest payments on the Companys debt for 2003 are projected to be $157 million (using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations). On June 3, 2002, Apache entered into a new $1.5 billion global credit facility to replace its existing global and 364 day credit facilities. The new global credit facility consists of four separate bank facilities: a $750 million 364 day facility in the United States; a $450 million five year facility in the United States; a $150 million five year facility in Australia; and a $150 million five year facility in Canada. Loans under the global credit facility do not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The five year facilities are scheduled to mature on June 3, 2007 and the 364 day facility is scheduled to mature on June 1, 2003. The 364 day facility allows the Company the option to convert outstanding revolving loans at maturity into one year term loans. The Company may request extensions of the maturity dates subject to approval of the lenders. Please see Note 6 Debt of Item 15 for a summary of the financial covenants of the global credit facility. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets (with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens), restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee the debt of entities not within our consolidated group. The Company has a $1.2 billion commercial paper program which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper balances at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such amounts on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under the U.S. five year facility and the 364 day facility. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. five year credit facility and 364 day credit facility are available as a 100 percent backstop. The weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was 1.85 percent in 2002 and 4.10 percent in 2001. PREFERRED INTERESTS OF SUBSIDIARIES During 2001, several of our subsidiaries issued a total of $443 million ($441 million, net of issuance costs) of preferred stock and limited partner interests to unrelated institutional investors, adding to the Companys financial liquidity. We pay a weighted average return to the investors of 123 basis points above the prevailing LIBOR interest rate. These subsidiaries are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements with the $437 million and $441 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, reflected as preferred interests of subsidiaries on the balance sheet. 32 STOCK TRANSACTIONS In December 2002, our board of directors declared a five percent stock dividend, payable on April 2, 2003, to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. No fractional shares will be issued and cash payments will be made in lieu of fractional shares. In connection with the declaration of this stock dividend, a reclassification was made to transfer $396 million from retained earnings to common stock and additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. On May 15, 2002, we completed the mandatory conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock into approximately 6.6 million (13.1 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) common shares. In September 2001, our Board of Directors declared a 10 percent stock dividend, which was paid on January 21, 2002, to shareholders of record on December 31, 2001. No fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares. In connection with the declaration of this stock dividend, a reclassification was made to transfer $545 million from retained earnings to common stock and additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. On January 22, 2003, we completed a public offering of approximately 9.9 million shares (19.8 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock, including 1.3 million shares (2.6 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) for the underwriters over allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million. LIQUIDITY During 2002, we strengthened our financial flexibility and continued to build upon the solid financial performances of previous years. Cash will be required to fund expenditures necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves typical in an extractive industry like ours. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and our success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. We believe that cash on hand, net cash generated from operating activities, and unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy future financial obligations and liquidity needs. Net cash generated from operating activities is a function of commodity prices, which are inherently volatile and unpredictable, production and capital spending. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will shrink, as stated in Item 1, "Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations". Based on the year end reserve life index, the Companys overall decline is approximately nine percent per year. This projection assumes the capital investment, prices, costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in Item 15 Note 15, of this Form 10 K. Less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and, therefore, capital budgets. For these reasons, we only forecast, for internal use by management, an annual cash flow. These annual forecasts are revised monthly and capital budgets are reviewed by management and adjusted as warranted by market conditions. Longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are neither developed nor used by management to operate our business. As of December 31, 2002, available borrowing capacity under our global credit facility was $1.2 billion. We had $52 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2002, an increase from $36 million at the prior year end. In addition, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from 1.34 at the end of last year to 1.44 at December 31, 2002. In August 2001, we purchased $116 million in U.S. Government Agency Notes and subsequently sold $13 million of the notes in 2001. Of the remaining balance, $17 million were designated as "available for sale" securities and were sold for approximately $17 million in January 2002. The remaining $86 million were designated as "held to maturity" and carried at amortized cost until they matured on October 15, 2002. The sales proceeds were used to pay down on our commercial paper balance. 33 We have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, preferred interests of subsidiaries, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Please see the indicated Note to the Companys consolidated financial statements, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations.

The Company currently includes such costs in the amortizable base of its oil and gas properties. Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003, the Company recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation. See Note 2, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations. The Company has reserved approximately $10 million for environmental remediation. The Companys exposure to other contingent liabilities is estimated at less than $8 million and is fully reserved. The Company does not believe it has any material exposure for any contingencies (see Note 11 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Upon closing of our acquisition of the North Sea properties, Apache will assume BPs abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, does not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache does not satisfy the abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to ensure Apaches payments of these costs, Apache agreed to 34 deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moodys and Standard and Poors from the Companys current ratings of A3 and A , respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change. If Apache is obligated to provide a letter of credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level. The initial letter of credit amount would be $282 million. This amount represents the letter of credit requirement through March 2004, and will be negotiated annually based on Apaches future abandonment obligation estimates. In addition, under Apaches long term oil physical sales contract with BP, related to the BP acquisition, Apache may be required to post margin if the mark to market exposure, as defined, exceeds the credit threshold limits. In addition to the letter of credit requirements covering BPs abandonment obligations, our liquidity could be further impacted by a downgrade of the credit rating for our senior unsecured long term debt by Standard and Poors to BBB or lower and by Moodys to Baa3 or lower; however, we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely. If our debt were to receive such a downgrade, our subsidiaries that issued the preferred interests could be in violation of their covenants which may require them to redeem some of the preferred interests (see Note 12, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). In addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements, Apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the Companys credit ratings decline significantly. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or any other purpose. Any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements will be scrutinized and disclosed by the Companys management. FUTURE TRENDS Apaches strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves: exploiting our existing asset base; acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value; and investing in high potential exploration prospects. Apaches present plans are to increase 2003 worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling to approximately $1.3 billion from $860 million in 2002. We will continue to monitor commodity prices and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly. We will also continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities should they become available at reasonable prices. EXPLOITING EXISTING ASSET BASE Apache seeks to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while reducing operating costs per unit. In order to achieve these objectives, we rigorously pursue production enhancement opportunities such as workovers, recompletions and moderate risk drilling, while divesting marginal and non strategic properties and identifying other activities to reduce costs. We expended a lot of effort in 2002 identifying exploitation opportunities which, when combined with our South Louisiana property purchase and our acquisition from BP, give us a large inventory at a time of high commodity prices. ACQUIRING PROPERTIES TO WHICH WE CAN ADD INCREMENTAL VALUE Apache seeks to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers. Our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, facilitating asset growth and debt reduction. Exorbitant acquisition prices caused Apache to sideline its 2002 acquisition activities early in the year until appropriate opportunities arose at reasonable prices, which began at the end of the year. 35 INVESTING IN HIGH POTENTIAL EXPLORATION PROSPECTS Apache seeks to concentrate its exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions. We believe that these investments, although generally higher risk, offer potential for attractive investment returns and significant reserve additions. Our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy. They complement our North American operations, which are more development oriented. A critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility. All three rating agencies recently reaffirmed "A credit ratings" on Apaches senior unsecured long term debt, a testament to our conservative financial structure and commitment to preserving a strong balance sheet while building a solid foundation and competitive advantage with which to pursue our growth initiatives. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY RISK The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of $18.85 per barrel to a high of $28.79 per barrel during 2002. Average gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of $2.11 per Mcf to a monthly high of $3.62 per Mcf during the same period. Based on the Companys 2002 worldwide oil production levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by $56 million. Based on the Companys 2002 worldwide gas production levels, a $.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by $39 million. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the SEC. Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes, do not exceed the "ceiling." This ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to additional DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities; however, as discussed above, sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As indicated in Notes 3 and 4, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K, the Company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with the South Louisiana acquisition in December 2002 and following year end, with the acquisition from BP. These positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices and were designated as cash flow hedged at anticipated production. At December 31, 2002, the Company had natural gas commodity collars with a negative fair value of $4 million. A 10 percent increase in gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars by $(5) million. A 10 percent decrease in gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars by $5 million. The model 36 used to arrive at the fair values for the commodity collars is based on a third party option pricing model. Changes in fair value, assuming 10 percent price changes, assume non constant volatility with volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2002. The natural gas and crude oil fixed price swaps and crude oil fixed price physical contracts entered into during the first quarter 2003 involved substantially more oil and gas volumes than the 2002 collars. For additional detail on our 2003 derivative positions, see Notes 3 and 4 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. We sell all of our Egyptian crude oil and natural gas to the EGPC for U.S. dollars. Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt during 2001 and 2002 have lessened the availability of U.S. dollars resulting in a one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. Continuation of the hard currency shortage in Egypt could lead to further delays, deferrals of payment or non payment in the future. INTEREST RATE RISK Approximately 85 percent of the Companys debt is issued at fixed interest rates, minimizing the Companys exposure to fluctuations in short term interest rates. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $317 million of floating rate debt and $437 million of preferred interests of subsidiaries, both of which are subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in the floating interest rate (approximately 22 basis points) on these year end balances, would be approximately $2 million. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2002 or 2001. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. Australian gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date. Prior to October 1, 2002, reported cash flow from Canadian operations was measured in Canadian dollars and converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported. The majority of Apaches debt in Canada is denominated in U.S. dollars and, as such, was adjusted for differences in exchange rates at each period end. This unrealized adjustment was recorded as Revenues and Other. In light of the continuing transformation of the U.S. and Canadian energy markets into a single energy market, we adopted the U.S. dollar as our functional currency in Canada, effective October 1, 2002. A 10 percent strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollar will result in a foreign currency net loss of approximately $31 million. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2002, or 2001. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, 37 fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices, may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW In 2002, Apache reported another very satisfactory year of growth and progress in our mission to build Apache incrementally to last. We finished the year with strong results, the third best year on a per share basis over our 48 year history. Our strong cash flow provided us the flexibility to make necessary and appropriate investments in continuation of our long term incremental growth strategy. On the back of a strong fourth quarter, we ended the year with a solid $544 million of net income attributable to common stock and $1.4 billion in cash from operating activities. We exited 2002 with our best quarter of the year and a strong financial position. Thirteen days into the new year, we announced the acquisition of $1.3 billion (subject to normal closing adjustments and the exercise of preferential rights by third parties) in properties from BP p.l.c. (BP), setting the stage for an exciting 2003. 17 Facing 2002 with the prospect of continued volatility in commodity prices, high service costs (including drilling, materials and contracted geophysical surveys) and unattractive acquisition prices, we exercised patience and discipline, restricting capital spending and focusing efforts on maintaining our competitive position by strengthening our balance sheet, growing our reserve base and maintaining production levels. As the year progressed, improving commodity prices and declining drilling costs placed us in an ideal position where we could continue increasing financial flexibility while simultaneously increasing capital spending, which we did beginning in the third quarter. Our worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling of $860 million were 46 percent higher than our initial plan, but still well below the $1.3 billion we spent in 2001. Ultimately, this strategy manifested itself in lower drilling costs, one of the lowest debt to capitalization ratios in our peer group, and our 17th consecutive year of reserve growth, ending with 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. It also left us positioned to acquire the BP properties in 2003 while maintaining our financial flexibility. Our capital expenditure reductions in the first half of 2002 were selective, both by region and by type of drilling. Rather than decrease exploration drilling, we increased it in the areas of Canada, Egypt, and Australia, all core producing areas that saw production growth in 2002. We had a successful exploration drilling program in 2002, reporting 16 discoveries worldwide. Production remained within one percent of prior year levels despite our capital spending curtailment in the first half of the year and back to back hurricanes, which forced us to shut in all of our Gulf of Mexico production for a brief period in late September and then again in early October. The foundation of Apaches strategy is a portfolio approach that was developed to provide diversity in terms of hydrocarbon product (oil or gas), geologic risk and geographic location. In 2002, 58 percent of our equivalent production came from outside the U.S., up from 51 percent in 2001. At year end 2002, our reserves were 49 percent oil and 51 percent gas, compared with 47 percent and 53 percent at year end 2001. In each of our core producing areas, our front line teams have the technical knowledge, sense of urgency and drive necessary to wring more value from Apaches assets. Building local expertise also provides a platform to compete and expand in our core areas through both operations and acquisitions. In the latter half of 2001, we felt that acquisition prices had reached exorbitant levels, relative to commodity prices, leading us to the sidelines until appropriate opportunities arose at reasonable prices, which began late in 2002. We spent approximately $355 million on acquisitions in 2002, compared with $1.2 billion in 2001 and $1.4 billion in 2000. The most significant of the 2002 activity came in December, when we announced the acquisition of properties in South Louisiana. As we have done in the past, and what has become a cornerstone of our acquisition strategy, we entered into hedges to protect the economics of the transaction, while at the same time preserving the potential for significantly higher gas realizations. See Note 4, in Item 15 of this Form 10 K. In January 2003, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with BP to purchase producing properties in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico for $1.3 billion (subject to normal closing adjustments and the exercise of preferential rights by third parties), the largest single acquisition in Apaches history. The acquisition from BP is significant in many respects: it extends our relationship to one of the worlds premier integrated major oil companies; it adds production and reserves and a new exploitation portfolio in North Americas strongest gas market; and it establishes a new core area in the North Sea, which fits our balanced portfolio business model and further diversifies our reserves and production. The Gulf properties are synergistic with our existing properties and made Apache the fourth largest producer and the second largest acreage holder in Gulf of Mexico waters to 1,200 feet deep. We will also become the ninth largest oil producer in the North Sea. The effective date of the transaction is January 1, 2003; the Gulf portion closed on March 13, 2003; the North Sea portion is projected to close early in the second quarter. The acquisition is being financed through a combination of internally generated funds, the issuance in January 2003 of common equity, and debt. Oil and gas production for the first two years has been hedged to provide Apache with fixed prices on expected production to protect against commodity price volatility (see Note 4 of Item 15 in this Form 10 K). On January 22, 2003, in conjunction with the BP transaction, we completed a public offering of 9.9 million shares (19.8 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock, including 18 1.3 million shares (2.6 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) for the underwriters over allotment option, raising net proceeds of $554 million. After announcing the BP acquisition, all three rating agencies reaffirmed Apaches single A credit ratings, a testament to our strong financial position, our conservative financial strategy, where we employ hedges to protect acquisition economics, and our three pronged approach to finance large scale transactions with internally generated funds, equity and debt. We believe that this reaffirmation of our credit ratings further establishes Apaches financial wherewithal and reputation as a reliable purchaser of major companies assets as they sell assets in the future. In December 2002, to recognize the Companys continued progress on both the financial and operational fronts, Apaches board of directors declared a special five percent common stock dividend payable on April 2, 2003, to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. On September 11, 2003, our board of directors declared a two for one stock split, which was distributed on January 14, 2004 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2003. All of the share and per share information included in this filing has been adjusted to reflect this stock dividend and the two for one stock split except where otherwise indicated. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. See Results of Operations and Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management. FULL COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful efforts method, cost such as geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method the net book value (full cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. We have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the 19 benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. As a result, we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments. The Company has taken note of a July 2003 inquiry to the Financial Accounting Standards Board regarding whether or not contract based oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contract ("mineral rights") should be recorded or disclosed as intangible assets. The inquiry presents a view that these mineral rights are intangible assets as defined in SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and, therefore, should be classified separately on the balance sheet as intangible assets. SFAS No. 141, and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became effective for transactions subsequent to June 30, 2001 with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 142 required as of January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets. Under the statement, intangible assets should be separately reported on the face of the balance sheet and accompanied by disclosure in the notes to financial statements. SFAS No. 142 scopes out accounting utilized by the oil and gas industry as prescribed by SFAS No. 19, and is silent about whether or not its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas companies. Apache does not believe that SFAS No. 141 or 142 change the classification of oil and gas mineral rights and the Company continues to classify these assets as part of oil and gas properties. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) has added the treatment of oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda, which may result in a change in how Apache classifies these assets. Should such a change be required, the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after June 30, 2001 that would be classified as "intangible undeveloped mineral interest" was $9 million and $78 million as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after June 30, 2001 that would be classified as "intangible developed mineral interest" was $88 million and $332 million as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Intangible developed mineral interest amounts are presented net of accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A). Accumulated DD&A was estimated using historical depletion rates applied proportionately to the costs of the acquisitions to be classified as "intangible developed mineral interest". The amounts noted above only include mineral rights acquired in business combinations or major asset purchases, and exclude those acquired individually or in groups as we have not historically tracked these in this manner. The Company has also not historically tracked the amount of mineral rights in the proved property balances related to producing leases or relinquished leases. We are currently identifying a methodology to do so for transactions subsequent to June 30, 2001. The numbers above are based on our understanding of the issue before the EITF, if all mineral rights associated with unevaluated property and producing reserves were deemed to be intangible assets: mineral rights with proved reserves that were acquired after June 30, 2001 and mineral rights with no proved reserves would be classified as intangible assets and would not be included in oil and gas properties on our consolidated balance sheet; results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected because mineral rights would continue to be amortized in accordance with full cost accounting rules; and disclosures required by SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 relative to intangibles would be included in the notes to our financial statements. If the accounting for mineral rights is ultimately changed, transitional guidance for intangible assets permits the reclassification of only amounts acquired after the effective date of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 if records were not previously maintained to track acquisition costs based on their intangible or tangible nature. Lack of these records prior to the effective date could result in the loss of comparability between historical balances of tangible and intangible asset balances and among companies in the industry. 20 RESERVE ESTIMATES Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a "ceiling" limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, their review covered 68, 61 and 72 percent of the reserve value, respectively. BAD DEBT EXPENSE We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties of which we are the operator. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings. Generally, our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months. In Egypt, however, we have experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Deteriorating economic conditions during 2001 and 2002 in Egypt have lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in an additional one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. Continuation of the hard currency shortage in Egypt could lead to further delays, deferrals of payment or non payment in the future. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Under the full cost method of accounting, as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections, the estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations, net of salvage, are currently included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." Apache adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as discussed in Note 2 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. SFAS No. 143 significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets ("asset retirement obligations" or "ARO"). Primarily, the new statement requires the Company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the Companys asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. 21 Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations. SFAS No. 143 requires a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception. The Company, therefore, calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the ARO liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance. The sum of these cumulative expenses was compared to the depletion expense originally recorded. Because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under SFAS No. 143, the difference resulted in a gain which the Company recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. Upon implementation, the Company also had to determine if the statement required us to recalculate our historical full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K). The Company chose not to re calculate its historical full cost ceiling tests even though its historical oil and gas property balances would have been higher had we applied the statement from inception. We believe this approach is appropriate because SFAS No. 143 is silent on this issue and was not effective during the prior impairment test periods. Had a recalculation of the historical full cost ceiling test resulted in impairment, the charge would have reduced the gain recorded upon adoption. Going forward, our depletion expense will be reduced since we will deplete a discounted ARO rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted. The lower depletion expense under SFAS No. 143 is offset, however, by higher accretion expense, which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time. Also going forward, the Company had to determine how to incorporate the asset retirement obligations into the quarterly calculation of its full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K). SFAS No. 143 is silent with respect to this issue and, although there are various views, the Company elected to continue including the undiscounted ARO as part of future development costs, essentially reducing the present value of its future net revenues and full cost ceiling limit. To compare the property balance, which included the ARO component, to the full cost ceiling limit, which has been reduced by a similar abandonment cost, we netted the ARO liability against the property balance. The Company believes its view is appropriate since there must be a comparable basis between the net book value of the properties and the full cost ceiling limitation. Another widely contemplated view is to exclude the ARO from future development costs when calculating the full cost ceiling limitation and not reduce the carrying amount of capitalized costs by the related liability. This approach would result in a higher full cost ceiling limitation and a higher net oil and gas property balance. INCOME TAXES Oil and gas exploration and production is a global business. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). We intend to permanently reinvest earnings from our international operations; therefore, we do not recognize deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, we would then reflect taxes on those earnings. 22 DERIVATIVES Apache uses commodity derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. Apache accounts for its commodity derivative contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133). Realized gains and losses from the Companys cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, are generally recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. SFAS 133 requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be reported in current period income, rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. This may result in significant volatility to current period income. SFAS 133 is complex and subject to a potentially wide range of interpretations in its application. As such, in 1998 the FASB established the Derivative Implementation Group (DIG) task force specifically to consider and to publish official interpretations of issues arising from the implementation of SFAS 133. The potential exists for additional issues to be brought under review, therefore, if subsequent interpretations of SFAS 133 are different than our current policy, it is possible that our policy, as stated above, would be modified. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section includes a discussion of our 2002 and 2001 results of operations. Apache has five reportable segments, which are the United States, Canada, Australia, Egypt and Other International. These segments are primarily in the business of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Please refer to Note 14 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for segment information. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES In 2002, we elected to exercise patience on the acquisition front, waiting for the frenzy that drove acquisition prices to unreasonable levels to ebb. We focused our attention on managing our financial structure by building equity and paying down debt so we would be in a position to act quickly when attractive assets became available at reasonable prices. Our oil and gas acquisitions in 2002 totaled approximately $350 million, adding 49 MMboe to our reserve base, far short of the $880 million and $1.3 billion we expended during 2001 and 2000, respectively, which added 213 MMboe and 254 MMboe of proved reserves. In addition, the acquisitions added $3 million, $146 million and $94 million of production, processing and transportation facilities in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and $197 million of goodwill in 2001. These acquisitions strengthened our position in core areas and provided promising prospects for future exploration and development activities. We will continue our strategy of finding additional reserves on the acquired properties and accelerating the production of those already identified while endeavoring to lower costs. Seventy five percent of our 2002 acquisition activity occurred in the U.S. and was related to the acquisition of properties primarily located in two Southern Louisiana parishes. The balance of our 2002 acquisitions primarily related to two acquisitions in Canada. In connection with our 2002 South Louisiana acquisition, we entered into costless collar hedges to protect Apache from the potential for falling gas prices and to protect the economics of the transaction. These hedges are consistent with some of our 2001 and 2000 acquisitions whereby we entered into and assumed fixed price commodity swaps and costless collars that protected Apache from falling commodity prices. This enabled us to better predict the financial performance of our acquisitions. See Note 4 of Item 15 for the terms of the Companys hedging activity. Over ninety percent of our 2001 activity was spent on three acquisitions, one in Canada and two in Egypt. The Fletcher acquisition in Canada totaled 55 percent while the Repsol and Novus acquisitions in Egypt totaled 37 percent of our acquisition activity. All three acquisitions added significant reserves and production. Over ninety percent of our 2000 activity involved four North American transactions, three in the U.S. and one in Canada. The U.S. acquisitions, which totaled 56 percent of our acquisition outlays, included properties acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Collins & Ware, Inc. and Repsol YPF. Our Canadian 23 acquisition from Phillips Petroleum Company represented 36 percent of the years activity. These four transactions added significant reserves and production. Our acquisitions over the last three years helped us maintain diversity in terms of hydrocarbon product (oil or gas), geologic risk and geographic location. As shown in Note 15 of this Form 10 K, our 2002 year end international reserves as a percentage of total reserves climbed to 52 percent from 41 percent at year end 2000. Similarly, our international average daily production in 2002 rose to 58 percent of our total production versus 41 percent in 2000. Our hydrocarbon product mix on a boe basis has remained relatively constant at 53 percent natural gas and 47 percent oil. While the U.S., a highly stable environment, remains our largest core area, Apache will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in existing core areas and in new areas should they arise. Note that, in light of the uncertainty of how the collapse of Enron Corp. would impact the derivatives markets, we closed all of our derivatives positions in October and November 2001, most of which were associated with prior acquisitions, recognizing a net gain of $10 million. A net gain of $24 million was recognized in 2002 and a $4 million net loss will be recognized in 2003 as the originally hedged volumes are produced. These, as well as the unwinding of our gas price swaps associated with advances from gas purchasers, increased the Companys average natural gas price by $.04 per Mcf during 2002, $.09 per Mcf during 2001 and $.05 per Mcf during 2000. They increased our average crude oil price by $.15 per bbl during 2002, and reduced our average crude oil price by $.42 per bbl during 2001 and $1.62 per bbl during 2000. We routinely evaluate our property portfolio and divest those that are marginal or no longer fit into our strategic growth program. We divested $7 million, $348 million and $26 million of properties during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. REVENUES Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on the prices we receive for our production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while economic factors such as the current U.S. recession could impact demand. Oil and Natural Gas Prices While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a world wide market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions. Apache sells its natural gas into three markets: 1) North America, which has a common market and where production is currently in short supply relative to demand. 2) Australia, which has a local market with limited demand and infrastructure. 3) Egypt, which has a local market and where the price received for the majority of our production is currently indexed to a weighted average Dated Brent crude oil price. For specific marketing arrangements by segment, please refer to Item 1, Business of this Form 10 K. Contributions to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues As with production and reserves, a consequence of geographic diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues and natural gas revenues. For the reasons discussed in the Oil and Natural Gas Price section above, contributions to oil revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately. 24 The following table presents each segments oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues, respectively. OIL REVENUES GAS REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 United States..................... 35% 40% 47% 51% 61% 72% Canada............................ 16% 17% 13% 29% 27% 16% North America..................... 51% 57% 60% 80% 88% 88% Egypt............................. 29% 27% 25% 15% 8% 7% Australia......................... 20% 16% 15% 5% 4% 5% Other International............... Total........................... 100% 100% 100% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% Crude Oil Contribution In 2002, oil revenues outside the U.S. reached approximately 65 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 60 percent in 2001. This increase primarily occurred in Egypt and Australia where crude oil revenues rose to 28 percent and 20 percent of total oil revenues, respectively. Canada contributed 16 percent of oil revenue, down from 17 percent in 2001. In 2001, oil revenues outside the U.S. totaled 60 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 53 percent in 2000. This increase was spread among Egypt, Canada and Australia. Egypts contribution totaled 27 percent, while Canada and Australia contributed 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Natural Gas Contribution The preponderance of consolidated natural gas revenues come from our North American operations. In 2002, 80 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from the North American market, 51 percent from the U.S. and 29 percent from Canada. The remaining 20 percent was split between Egypt, 15 percent, and Australia, 5 percent. In 2001, 88 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from the North American market, 61 percent from the U.S. and 27 percent from Canada. The remaining natural gas revenues were primarily split between Egypt, 8 percent, and Australia, 3 percent. 25 The table below presents oil and gas production revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids.

The price decline reduced revenues by $342 million, while lower gas production reduced revenues by another $49 million. A gas production decline of 18 percent was experienced in the U.S., with declines of 21 percent and 13 percent in the Gulf Coast and Central regions respectively. The Gulf Coast region, which contributed 61.5% of Apaches U.S. 2002 production, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial rates followed by steep declines when compared to other U.S. producing regions. This attribute coupled with capital curtailments, property sales in late 2001 and back to back hurricanes in September and October 2002 contributed to the production decline in the U.S. Collectively, Canada, Egypt, Australia and Argentina saw a 13 percent increase in natural gas production. Canadas increase was the result of previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity, coupled with successful results at Ladyfern, which offset natural decline at Zama. Egypts increase also came from previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. A 36 percent increase in our natural gas production contributed $390 million to 2001 revenues. Canadas increase was primarily driven by our acquisition of producing properties from Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) in December 2000 and Fletcher Challenge in March 2001 as well as strong exploration and development results from the Ladyfern area. A full year of production from the properties we acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) in August 2000 and Collins & Ware, Inc. (Collins & Ware) in June 2000 helped boost our domestic production by 13 percent, while properties acquired from Repsol helped double our Egyptian production. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. We have used long term, fixed price physical contracts to lock in a small portion of our domestic future natural gas production. The contracts provide protection to the Company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices and represented approximately 11 percent of our 2002 and 2001 domestic natural gas production. In 2002, these contracts positively impacted our average realized price by $.01 per Mcf. Historically high prices in the first half of 2001 resulted in a negative impact of $.06 per Mcf in that year. Additionally, substantially all of our natural gas production sold in Australia is subject to long term fixed price contracts. Crude Oil Revenues Oil revenues improved $137 million in 2002 with both a higher realized price and higher production. The weighted average realized price for oil improved $1.60 per barrel, adding $86 million to oil revenues, while oil production gains added another $51 million. The price improvement was across the board, while production gains of 29 percent and 12 percent occurred in Australia and Egypt, respectively. The Legendre, Simpson and Gibson/South Plato developments drove Australias gain, while Egypts increase was related to the Repsol acquisition and subsequent drilling. U.S. production declined nine percent related to natural decline, back to back hurricanes in late September and early October and property sales. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. Our crude oil revenues increased in 2001 despite a 15 percent drop in the average realized price, as crude oil production increased 29 percent. The acquisition and subsequent exploitation of properties acquired from Repsol, in March 2001, contributed to a 41 percent increase in our year over year Egyptian production. Strong results on properties acquired from Fletcher Challenge in March 2001 and Phillips in December 2000 helped us increase our Canadian oil production by 76 percent. We also had success on the drilling front, increasing our Australian production by nearly 51 percent with successful development of the Legendre, Gipsy/North Gipsy and Simpson fields. 27 OPERATING EXPENSES The table below presents a detail of our expenses. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 (IN MILLIONS) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment........................ $ 784 $ 760 $ 548 Other assets.............................................. 60 61 36 International impairments................................... 20 65 Lease operating costs....................................... 462 405 254 Gathering and transportation costs.......................... 38 35 19 Severance and other taxes................................... 63 70 59 General and administrative expenses......................... 105 89 76 Financing costs, net........................................ 113 118 106 Total.................................................. $1,645 $1,603 $1,098 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Apaches full cost DD&A expense is driven by many factors including certain costs incurred in the exploration, development, and acquisition of producing reserves, production levels, and estimates of proved reserve quantities and future developmental costs. In 2002, our full cost DD&A expense increased $24 million. Areas outside the U.S. saw an increase in their expense, while DD&A expense decreased in the U.S. The areas experiencing the largest increase in absolute costs were Egypt, up $29 million and Australia, up $24 million (consistent with their overall increase in production), while the U.S. experienced a $39 million decline in full cost DD&A expense on lower production levels. Canada also had higher DD&A expense of $7 million relating to higher production levels. On a boe basis our 2002 full cost DD&A rate rose $.24 to $6.29. The U.S. contributed $.13 to the increase in rate, driven by higher finding costs and higher future development costs. The remaining increase in the consolidated rate is split between Egypt and Australia. The impact from Egypt is related to higher finding and development costs. The impact from Australia is primarily related to higher future development costs. In 2001, our full cost DD&A expense increased $212 million. The higher expense was spread among Canada, up $87 million, the U.S., up $63 million, Egypt, up $43 million and Australia, up $19 million, which is consistent with their overall increase in production. On a boe basis our 2001 full cost DD&A rate rose $.30 to $6.05. The U.S. contributed two thirds to the increase in rate, related to higher finding costs and negative reserve revisions associated with declining prices. Canada contributed $.04 to the increase in the overall rate, reflecting the impact of higher future development costs. Australia also contributed $.04 to the increase in the overall rate, reflecting higher future development costs during 2001. Depreciation on other assets remained flat in 2002 after increasing $25 million in 2001 associated with additional facilities acquired in March 2001 from Fletcher in Canada, and Repsol in Egypt, and the amortization of goodwill. In connection with the adoption of a new accounting principle effective January 1, 2002, we no longer amortize our goodwill. Instead, it is assessed for periodic impairment, as discussed in the impairment section below. Impairments We periodically assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment based on geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of acreage. When an impairment occurs, costs associated with these 28 properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. In some of our international exploration plays, however, we have not yet established proved reserves. As such, any impairments in these areas are immediately charged to earnings. During 2001, we impaired a portion of our unproved property costs in Poland and China by $65 million ($41 million after tax). In 2002, we impaired an additional $20 million in Poland ($12 million after tax). At December 31, 2002, the Company had $13 million of unproved property costs remaining in Poland. We are continuing to evaluate our operations in Poland, which may result in additional impairments in 2003. Goodwill is subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment beginning in 2002. Goodwill totals $189 million at December 31, 2002 and no impairment was recorded in 2002. For further discussion, see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Lease Operating Costs Lease operating costs (LOE) is generally comprised of several components; direct operating costs, repair and maintenance costs, workover costs and ad valorem costs. LOE is driven in part by the type of commodity produced, the level of workover activity and the geographical location of the properties. Oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy. They enable us to exploit our existing reserves by accelerating production and taking advantage of high pricing environments. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with plants and facilities. During 2002, LOE was $3.71 per boe, a $.49 increase from 2001. Higher absolute costs accounted for 94 percent, $.46 per boe, of this rate increase, with lower production accounting for the remaining $.03 per boe. We experienced higher absolute costs in the Gulf Coast region, Egypt and Canada. In the Gulf Coast region increased repairs and maintenance, related to both routine operations and hurricane repairs, generally higher costs on properties operated by others on offshore Gulf of Mexico properties and increased workover activity in the region, contributed to higher LOE. In Egypt, higher workover activity on the Khalda, South Umbarka and East Bahariya concessions drove up LOE. In Canada, the increased costs reflect the impact of the Fletcher, Conoco and Burlington acquisitions, which carry higher production costs than our other operations, and increased workover activity, with the heaviest activity at House Mountain, Hatton, Zama and Simonette fields. In 2001, LOE was $3.22 per boe, a $.56 increase from 2000. This increase was driven by our acquisitions of Canadian and offshore Gulf of Mexico oil properties, higher service costs and increased workover activity in the U.S. and Canada. Gathering and Transportation Costs During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." Prior to adoption, amounts paid to third parties for transportation had been reported as a reduction of revenue instead of an increase in operating expenses. Recent property acquisitions and their associated transportation arrangements have increased the significance of transportation costs paid to third parties. For comparative purposes, previously reported transportation costs paid to third parties were reclassified as corresponding increases to oil and gas production revenues and operating expenses with no impact on income attributable to common stock. These costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our North American operations. In 2002, the costs totaled $21 million in Canada and $17 million in the U.S., relatively flat to the prior year. In 2001, these costs totaled $19 million in Canada and $16 million in the U.S., up from $12 million in Canada and $8 million in the U.S. The increase over the 2000 period is related to higher volumes subject to such rates, principally from properties acquired from Fletcher in Canada, and Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation in August 2000. 29 Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes are comprised primarily of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia. In both 2002 and 2001, these severance taxes, which are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, represented over 80 percent of the total severance and other taxes expense incurred in each period. The other tax component is primarily made up of the Australian Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), to which Apache first became subject in 2002, and the Canadian Large Corporation Tax, Saskatchewan Capital Tax and Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. Oil and gas production revenues generated from Egypt and Canada are not subject to severance taxes. In 2002, severance and other taxes totaled $63 million, comprised of U.S., $35 million, Australia, $23 million and Canada, $5 million. Overall, severance and other taxes decreased $7 million. A $14 million decline in U.S. severance taxes, and a $3 million decline in Canada Saskatchewan Resource Surtax were partially offset by initial PRRT of $4 million and a $7 million increase in Australian severance taxes. The decrease in U.S. severance taxes reflects the impact of lower gas price realizations. The increase in Australias severance taxes was attributable to higher oil price realizations and a change in production mix as a higher portion of production was from properties in provincial waters, such as Legendre and Harriet, relative to production from federal waters. Canadas decline was primarily related to a refund of the Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. In 2001, severance and other taxes totaled $70 million ($50 million in the U.S., $12 million in Australia and $8 million in Canada). Severance and other taxes increased $11 million from the prior year. The increase related to higher severance taxes in Australia and, collectively, a $3 million increase in Canadas Large Corporation Tax and Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. The increase in Australias severance taxes was attributable to higher production driven oil and gas revenues. Canadas increase was related to properties acquired from Fletcher in March 2001 and Phillips Petroleum Company in December 2000. U.S. severance and other taxes were up $2 million over the prior year. Higher production driven oil and gas revenues and a higher effective production tax rate accounted for the majority of the increase in the U.S. Available incentives granted by the state of Oklahoma decline with rising commodity prices, increasing the effective tax rate. General and Administrative Expenses Overall, general and administrative expenses (G&A) trended higher in 2002, rising $.13 to $.84 per boe. Thirty eight percent of the increase is tied to rising medical costs, a sharp increase in premiums on business insurance policies renewed subsequent to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the addition of a sizeable political risk insurance package added in mid 2001. The remaining increase is related to non recurring employee separation costs, a consequence of our region realignment in the U.S., higher outside legal support costs related to arbitration proceedings with our gas marketer, Cinergy and litigation with Predator (see Note 11 of this Form 10 K), costs associated with the implementation of and compliance with various sections of Sarbanes Oxley, and a full year of expense related to additional staff and office costs incurred with the acquisition of Canadian subsidiaries of Fletcher during 2001. Realignment of our three U.S. regions into two involved both reassignment and reduction of personnel. All corresponding costs were expensed as incurred. During 2001 absolute G&A increased as the size of our company grew from acquisitions. However, 2001 G&A on an equivalent barrel basis declined 10 percent from 2000 to $.71 as the incremental production was added at a lower G&A rate. Financing Costs, Net Net financing costs decreased by five percent in 2002. The major components of net financing costs are interest expense and capitalized interest. Lower average debt outstanding during 2002 resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $23 million. A reduction in capitalized interest of $16 million, associated with lower unproved property balances, partially offset this decrease. Net financing costs increased 11 percent in 2001, related to higher average outstanding borrowings coupled with lower capitalized interest, partially offset by lower average effective interest rates. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2002 was 30 6.3 percent compared to 5.9 percent on December 31, 2001. The rate is higher at year end 2002 as a lower percentage of our debt is at floating rates, which carry a lower rate than fixed rate debt.

The preliminary capital expenditure budget for 2003 is approximately $1.3 billion (excluding acquisitions), including $850 million for North America. Preliminary North American capital expenditures include $350 million in the Gulf Coast region, $100 million in the Central region and $400 million in Canada. The Company has estimated its international capital expenditures in 2003 at $400 million. Capital expenditures will be reviewed periodically, and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions. CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS Apache paid a total of $13 million in dividends during 2002 on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998 and its Series C Preferred Stock issued in May 1999. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock were paid through May 15, 2002, when the shares automatically converted to common stock (see Note 9, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Common dividends paid during 2002 rose 61 percent to $56 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 36 consecutive years through 2002. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. CAPITAL RESOURCES Apaches primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flows. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices, drilling and acquisition costs, and cash flow. The Company has 31 historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities, debt, preferred interests of subsidiaries and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all other cash needs. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 totaled $1.4 billion, a decrease of 28 percent from 2001 driven by lower oil and gas production revenues and slightly higher operating expenses. Oil and gas production revenues fell with a 22 percent decline in gas prices, which was partially offset by a seven percent improvement in oil prices. The impact of lower gas production was partially offset by rising oil production. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2001 increased 26 percent to a record $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion in 2000. The primary reason for the increase is attributed to the additional oil and gas revenues from production on properties acquired during 2000 and 2001. DEBT At December 31, 2002, Apache had outstanding debt of $280 million under its commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit and a total of $1.9 billion of other debt. This other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years 2003 through 2096. Based on our current plan for capital spending and projections of debt and interest rates, interest payments on the Companys debt for 2003 are projected to be $157 million (using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations). On June 3, 2002, Apache entered into a new $1.5 billion global credit facility to replace its existing global and 364 day credit facilities. The new global credit facility consists of four separate bank facilities: a $750 million 364 day facility in the United States; a $450 million five year facility in the United States; a $150 million five year facility in Australia; and a $150 million five year facility in Canada. Loans under the global credit facility do not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The five year facilities are scheduled to mature on June 3, 2007 and the 364 day facility is scheduled to mature on June 1, 2003. The 364 day facility allows the Company the option to convert outstanding revolving loans at maturity into one year term loans. The Company may request extensions of the maturity dates subject to approval of the lenders. Please see Note 6 Debt of Item 15 for a summary of the financial covenants of the global credit facility. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets (with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens), restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee the debt of entities not within our consolidated group. The Company has a $1.2 billion commercial paper program which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper balances at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such amounts on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under the U.S. five year facility and the 364 day facility. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. five year credit facility and 364 day credit facility are available as a 100 percent backstop. The weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was 1.85 percent in 2002 and 4.10 percent in 2001. PREFERRED INTERESTS OF SUBSIDIARIES During 2001, several of our subsidiaries issued a total of $443 million ($441 million, net of issuance costs) of preferred stock and limited partner interests to unrelated institutional investors, adding to the Companys financial liquidity. We pay a weighted average return to the investors of 123 basis points above the prevailing LIBOR interest rate. These subsidiaries are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements with the $437 million and $441 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, reflected as preferred interests of subsidiaries on the balance sheet. 32 STOCK TRANSACTIONS In December 2002, our board of directors declared a five percent stock dividend, payable on April 2, 2003, to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. No fractional shares will be issued and cash payments will be made in lieu of fractional shares. In connection with the declaration of this stock dividend, a reclassification was made to transfer $396 million from retained earnings to common stock and additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. On May 15, 2002, we completed the mandatory conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock into approximately 6.6 million (13.1 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) common shares. In September 2001, our Board of Directors declared a 10 percent stock dividend, which was paid on January 21, 2002, to shareholders of record on December 31, 2001. No fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares. In connection with the declaration of this stock dividend, a reclassification was made to transfer $545 million from retained earnings to common stock and additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. On January 22, 2003, we completed a public offering of approximately 9.9 million shares (19.8 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock, including 1.3 million shares (2.6 million shares adjusted for the two for one stock split) for the underwriters over allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million. LIQUIDITY During 2002, we strengthened our financial flexibility and continued to build upon the solid financial performances of previous years. Cash will be required to fund expenditures necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves typical in an extractive industry like ours. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and our success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. We believe that cash on hand, net cash generated from operating activities, and unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy future financial obligations and liquidity needs. Net cash generated from operating activities is a function of commodity prices, which are inherently volatile and unpredictable, production and capital spending. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will shrink, as stated in Item 1, "Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations". Based on the year end reserve life index, the Companys overall decline is approximately nine percent per year. This projection assumes the capital investment, prices, costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in Item 15 Note 15, of this Form 10 K. Less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and, therefore, capital budgets. For these reasons, we only forecast, for internal use by management, an annual cash flow. These annual forecasts are revised monthly and capital budgets are reviewed by management and adjusted as warranted by market conditions. Longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are neither developed nor used by management to operate our business. As of December 31, 2002, available borrowing capacity under our global credit facility was $1.2 billion. We had $52 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2002, an increase from $36 million at the prior year end. In addition, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from 1.34 at the end of last year to 1.44 at December 31, 2002. In August 2001, we purchased $116 million in U.S. Government Agency Notes and subsequently sold $13 million of the notes in 2001. Of the remaining balance, $17 million were designated as "available for sale" securities and were sold for approximately $17 million in January 2002. The remaining $86 million were designated as "held to maturity" and carried at amortized cost until they matured on October 15, 2002. The sales proceeds were used to pay down on our commercial paper balance. 33 We have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, preferred interests of subsidiaries, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Please see the indicated Note to the Companys consolidated financial statements, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations.

The Company currently includes such costs in the amortizable base of its oil and gas properties. Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003, the Company recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation. See Note 2, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations. The Company has reserved approximately $10 million for environmental remediation. The Companys exposure to other contingent liabilities is estimated at less than $8 million and is fully reserved. The Company does not believe it has any material exposure for any contingencies (see Note 11 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Upon closing of our acquisition of the North Sea properties, Apache will assume BPs abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, does not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache does not satisfy the abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to ensure Apaches payments of these costs, Apache agreed to 34 deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moodys and Standard and Poors from the Companys current ratings of A3 and A , respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change. If Apache is obligated to provide a letter of credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level. The initial letter of credit amount would be $282 million. This amount represents the letter of credit requirement through March 2004, and will be negotiated annually based on Apaches future abandonment obligation estimates. In addition, under Apaches long term oil physical sales contract with BP, related to the BP acquisition, Apache may be required to post margin if the mark to market exposure, as defined, exceeds the credit threshold limits. In addition to the letter of credit requirements covering BPs abandonment obligations, our liquidity could be further impacted by a downgrade of the credit rating for our senior unsecured long term debt by Standard and Poors to BBB or lower and by Moodys to Baa3 or lower; however, we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely. If our debt were to receive such a downgrade, our subsidiaries that issued the preferred interests could be in violation of their covenants which may require them to redeem some of the preferred interests (see Note 12, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). In addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements, Apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the Companys credit ratings decline significantly. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or any other purpose. Any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements will be scrutinized and disclosed by the Companys management. FUTURE TRENDS Apaches strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves: exploiting our existing asset base; acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value; and investing in high potential exploration prospects. Apaches present plans are to increase 2003 worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling to approximately $1.3 billion from $860 million in 2002. We will continue to monitor commodity prices and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly. We will also continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities should they become available at reasonable prices. EXPLOITING EXISTING ASSET BASE Apache seeks to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while reducing operating costs per unit. In order to achieve these objectives, we rigorously pursue production enhancement opportunities such as workovers, recompletions and moderate risk drilling, while divesting marginal and non strategic properties and identifying other activities to reduce costs. We expended a lot of effort in 2002 identifying exploitation opportunities which, when combined with our South Louisiana property purchase and our acquisition from BP, give us a large inventory at a time of high commodity prices. ACQUIRING PROPERTIES TO WHICH WE CAN ADD INCREMENTAL VALUE Apache seeks to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers. Our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, facilitating asset growth and debt reduction. Exorbitant acquisition prices caused Apache to sideline its 2002 acquisition activities early in the year until appropriate opportunities arose at reasonable prices, which began at the end of the year. 35 INVESTING IN HIGH POTENTIAL EXPLORATION PROSPECTS Apache seeks to concentrate its exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions. We believe that these investments, although generally higher risk, offer potential for attractive investment returns and significant reserve additions. Our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy. They complement our North American operations, which are more development oriented. A critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility. All three rating agencies recently reaffirmed "A credit ratings" on Apaches senior unsecured long term debt, a testament to our conservative financial structure and commitment to preserving a strong balance sheet while building a solid foundation and competitive advantage with which to pursue our growth initiatives. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY RISK The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of $18.85 per barrel to a high of $28.79 per barrel during 2002. Average gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of $2.11 per Mcf to a monthly high of $3.62 per Mcf during the same period. Based on the Companys 2002 worldwide oil production levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by $56 million. Based on the Companys 2002 worldwide gas production levels, a $.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by $39 million. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the SEC. Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes, do not exceed the "ceiling." This ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to additional DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities; however, as discussed above, sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As indicated in Notes 3 and 4, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K, the Company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with the South Louisiana acquisition in December 2002 and following year end, with the acquisition from BP. These positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices and were designated as cash flow hedged at anticipated production. At December 31, 2002, the Company had natural gas commodity collars with a negative fair value of $4 million. A 10 percent increase in gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars by $(5) million. A 10 percent decrease in gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars by $5 million. The model 36 used to arrive at the fair values for the commodity collars is based on a third party option pricing model. Changes in fair value, assuming 10 percent price changes, assume non constant volatility with volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2002. The natural gas and crude oil fixed price swaps and crude oil fixed price physical contracts entered into during the first quarter 2003 involved substantially more oil and gas volumes than the 2002 collars. For additional detail on our 2003 derivative positions, see Notes 3 and 4 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. We sell all of our Egyptian crude oil and natural gas to the EGPC for U.S. dollars. Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt during 2001 and 2002 have lessened the availability of U.S. dollars resulting in a one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. Continuation of the hard currency shortage in Egypt could lead to further delays, deferrals of payment or non payment in the future. INTEREST RATE RISK Approximately 85 percent of the Companys debt is issued at fixed interest rates, minimizing the Companys exposure to fluctuations in short term interest rates. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $317 million of floating rate debt and $437 million of preferred interests of subsidiaries, both of which are subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in the floating interest rate (approximately 22 basis points) on these year end balances, would be approximately $2 million. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2002 or 2001. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. Australian gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date. Prior to October 1, 2002, reported cash flow from Canadian operations was measured in Canadian dollars and converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported. The majority of Apaches debt in Canada is denominated in U.S. dollars and, as such, was adjusted for differences in exchange rates at each period end. This unrealized adjustment was recorded as Revenues and Other. In light of the continuing transformation of the U.S. and Canadian energy markets into a single energy market, we adopted the U.S. dollar as our functional currency in Canada, effective October 1, 2002. A 10 percent strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollar will result in a foreign currency net loss of approximately $31 million. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2002, or 2001. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, 37 fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices, may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
