SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS A special meeting of the Companys stockholders was held in Houston, Texas, at 10:00 a.m. local time, on Thursday, December 18, 2003. Proxies for the meeting were solicited pursuant to Regulation 14 under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. There was no solicitation in opposition to the proposal to amend the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Apaches common stock from 215,000,000 shares to 430,000,000 shares, and the amendment was approved. 13 Out of a total of 162,037,849 shares of the Companys common stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of October 29, 2003, the record date for the special meeting, October 29, 2003, 142,137,696 shares, or 87.7 percent, were present at the meeting in person or by proxy. The vote tabulation for amendment of Apaches Restated Certificate of Incorporation was as follows: FOR AGAINST WITHHELD 140,150,724 1,173,351 813,621 The shares referenced above have not been adjusted for the two for one stock split, record date December 31, 2003, distributed January 14, 2004. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS During 2003 Apache common stock, par value $0.625 per share, was traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Stock Exchange under the symbol APA. The table below provides certain information regarding our common stock for 2003 and 2002. Prices were obtained from the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Reporting System; however, the per share prices and dividends shown in the following table have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split and the five percent stock dividend, all of which are described below. Per share prices and dividends shown below have been rounded to the indicated decimal place. 2003 2002 PRICE RANGE DIVIDENDS PER SHARE PRICE RANGE DIVIDENDS PER SHARE HIGH LOW DECLARED PAID HIGH LOW DECLARED PAID First Quarter........... $32.15 $26.26 $.0475 $.0475 $27.71 $21.12 $.0475 $.0475 Second Quarter.......... 34.60 28.13 .0500 .0500 28.61 25.03 .0475 .0475 Third Quarter........... 35.04 30.41 .0600 .0500 28.57 21.46 .0475 .0475 Fourth Quarter.......... 41.68 34.05 .0600 .0600 28.88 23.53 .0475 .0475 The closing price per share of our common stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Reporting System for February 27, 2004 , was $41.17. At February 29, 2004, there were 325,035,928 shares of our common stock outstanding held by approximately 8,000 shareholders of record and approximately 157,000 beneficial owners. We have paid cash dividends on our common stock for 39 consecutive years through December 31, 2003. When, and if, declared by our board of directors, future dividend payments will depend upon our level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. In 1995, our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan to replace the former plan adopted in 1986. Under our stockholder rights plan, each of our common stockholders received a dividend of one "preferred stock purchase right" for each 2.310 outstanding shares of common stock (adjusted for the 10 percent and five percent stock dividends and two for one stock split) that the stockholder owned. We refer to these preferred stock purchase rights as the "rights." Unless the rights have been previously redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock are issued with rights. The rights trade automatically with our shares of common stock. Certain triggering events will give the holders of the rights the ability to purchase shares of our common stock, or the equivalent stock of a person that acquires us, at a discount. The triggering events relate to persons or groups acquiring an amount of our common stock in excess of a set percentage, or attempting to or actually acquiring us. The details of how the rights operate are set out in our certificate of incorporation and the Rights Agreement, dated January 31, 1996, between Apache and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A. (formerly Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A.). Both of those documents have been filed as exhibits to this Form 10 K and you should review them to fully understand the effects of the rights. The purpose of the rights is to encourage potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors before attempting a takeover bid and to provide our board of directors with leverage in negotiating on behalf of our stockholders the terms of 14 any proposed takeover. The rights may have certain anti takeover effects. They should not, however, interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by our board of directors. On September 13, 2001, our board of directors declared a 10 percent dividend on our shares of common stock payable in common stock on January 21, 2002 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2001. Pursuant to the terms of the declared 10 percent stock dividend, we issued 26,916,872 shares (adjusted for the 2002 five percent stock dividend and the 2003 stock split) of our common stock on January 21, 2002 to the holders of the 130,888,270 shares (adjusted for the five percent stock dividend and the stock split) of common stock outstanding on December 31, 2001. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the stock dividend and cash payments totaling $891,132 were made in lieu of fractional shares. On December 18, 2002, our board of directors declared a five percent dividend on our shares of common stock payable in common stock on April 2, 2003 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. Pursuant to the terms of the declared five percent stock dividend, we issued approximately 15,736,496 shares of (adjusted for the 2003 stock split) our common stock on April 2, 2003 to the holders of the 307,819,628 of common stock outstanding (adjusted for the 2003 stock split) on March 12, 2003. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the stock dividend and we made cash payments totaling approximately $1,437,000 in lieu of fractional shares. On January 22, 2003, in conjunction with the pending BP acquisition, the Company completed the public offering of 19.8 million shares (adjusted for the stock split) of Apache common stock, including 2.6 million shares (adjusted for the stock split) for the underwriters over allotment option, at $29.05 per share. Net proceeds after placement fees totaled approximately $554 million. The proceeds were used to repay indebtedness under our commercial paper program and money market lines of credit and to invest in short term treasury only money market funds and treasury notes to hold funds for the $1.3 billion BP acquisition. On September 11, 2003, our board of directors declared a two for one common stock split which was distributed on January 14, 2004 to holders of record on December 31, 2003. In connection with the stock split, the company issued 166,254,667 shares. 15 ITEM 6.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Apache Corporation is an independent energy company whose principle business includes exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. During 2003 the Company added an additional international core area with the acquisition of the U.K. North Sea Forties Field from BP p.l.c. (BP). The Companys other core geographic areas include operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and Egypt. Smaller, non core operations are conducted in China and Argentina. Apache adheres to a portfolio approach to provide diversity in terms of hydrocarbon mix (crude oil and natural gas), geologic risk and geographic location. Our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through drilling, through acquisitions, or through a combination of both, depending on what the environment gives us. As we pursue growth, we continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet our future financial obligations and liquidity needs. These obligations and needs must be met with cash on hand, cash generated from our operations, unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility and the capital markets. The interest cost of debt and access to the equity markets are greatly influenced by a companys ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate ongoing operating cash flow. For these reasons, we strive to maintain a manageable debt load that is properly balanced with equity, and our single A credit ratings. We are also cognizant of the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves. Consequently, we must stay abreast of industry drilling costs and the price 16 at which properties are available for purchase, when choosing where to allocate our available funds. We monitor operating costs, on both an absolute dollar and per unit of production basis, relative to our historical norms and relative to our industry sector, factoring in the impact from property acquisitions and changes in industry conditions. Given the inherent volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices, and changing industry conditions, we frequently revise our forecasts and adjust our budgets accordingly. Commodity prices throughout 2003 were relatively high and remained consistently strong throughout the year. This price consistency allowed us to maintain a fairly constant level of capital expenditures for exploration and development drilling throughout the year. Our 2003 drilling and acquisition capital expenditures (discussed below) were balanced, as we grew both production and reserves to record levels, while maintaining a balance in terms of hydrocarbon mix. We had exceptional profitability growth in 2003, achieving several operational and financial milestones noted below: Our 2003 oil and gas production revenues reached a record $4.2 billion, 64 percent higher than in 2002. We generated record earnings of $1.1 billion, more than twice our prior year level. More importantly, on a diluted share basis earnings rose 91 percent to a record $3.43 per share. Cash from operating activities increased 96 percent from the prior year to a record $2.7 billion. Production averaged a record 417,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), the 24th increase in the last 25 years. In mid July 2003, production was initiated on the Zhao Dong block in Bohai Bay, offshore China. We began actively marketing our U.S. natural gas effective with July 2003 production. With our 2nd quarter North American daily natural gas production exceeding one billion cubic feet (Bcf), we felt it was prudent to bring this responsibility back in house. On December 16, 2003 we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) for a Gas Sales Agreement, Field Development Plan and Deepwater Development Lease for a minimum of 2.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas over 25 years from the deepwater portion of our Egyptian West Mediterranean Concession. Production is scheduled to commence in 2007, contingent upon completion of significant development infrastructure and resolution of delays in certain payments for production by EGPC. We ended the year with record proved reserves of 1.66 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), marking the 18th consecutive year of reserve growth. Nearly half of our proved reserve additions were added through exploration and development activities. We began our 49th year in a strong financial position and on January 13, 2003, we announced the BP acquisition, our single largest acquisition to date, establishing a new international core area and augmenting our Gulf of Mexico portfolio. The BP acquisition fit our balanced portfolio business model and provides the potential for internal growth similar to what we have experienced in other areas. It also extends our relationship with one of the worlds largest integrated major companies. In July 2003, we consummated a deal with Shell Exploration and Production Company (Shell) adding additional oil and gas fields on the outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Our total acquisition costs for 2003 were approximately $1.6 billion, compared to $355 million in the prior year. These acquisitions are discussed in more detail below. Our worldwide capital expenditures for exploration and development were approximately $1.5 billion, 73 percent higher than 2002 and approximately 18 percent higher than our initial plan. Our strong cash flow enabled us to allocate additional funds to exploration and development during 2003. We spent approximately 69 percent of our exploration and development capital in North America, which is consistent with reserve and production contributions. We had numerous drilling successes throughout the year, particularly in Egypt and Australia: Our most significant exploration success in Egypt, announced in July 2003, was the Qasr 1X well located on the Khalda Concession. In November, we announced completion of the Qasr 2X confirming the Qasr 1X discovery. We believe the Qasr discovery has the potential to be the most 17 significant discovery in Apaches 49 years. Production was initiated on a restricted basis in the fourth quarter of 2003, with full production expected in 2005, pending completion of additional development wells, appraisal wells and construction of pipeline facilities. In July 2003, we announced that our Ravensworth 1 well discovered oil in the Exmouth Sub Basin offshore Western Australia, creating a new oil play area for Apache in an oil prone area and adding a new dimension to our exploration program offshore Western Australia. Early in October 2003, we announced our second discovery in the Exmouth Sub Basin, the Crosby 1, providing additional confidence that we have established a new oil play area. Appraisal wells along with additional exploration drilling will occur in 2004. Following a very active year of drilling and acquisitions, our year end 2003 reserves remained balanced at 51 percent oil and 49 percent natural gas, compared with 49 percent oil and 51 percent natural gas at year end 2002. The increase in oil reserves is primarily attributable to the properties acquired in the North Sea. During 2003, the U.S. contributed 45 percent of equivalent production, up from 42 percent in 2002, reflecting the impact of the Gulf of Mexico assets acquired from BP and Shell. Apache ended the year in a strong financial position, maintaining single A credit ratings on unsecured long term debt issued by Moodys, Standard and Poors and Fitch rating agencies. Also, we reduced debt to 26 percent of capitalization despite over $3 billion in capital expenditures. To manage our financial flexibility, we consummated several debt and equity transactions during 2003: On January 22, 2003, in conjunction with the pending BP transaction, we completed a public offering of 19.8 million shares of common stock, adjusted for the two for one stock split, raising $554 million. During the second quarter, the Company issued $350 million of 12 year, senior unsecured notes at a 4.375 percent coupon rate. Proceeds were used to reduce bank debt and outstanding commercial paper, and for general corporate purposes. To take advantage of historically low interest rates on commercial paper and better position ourselves to pay down short term debt, if we so elect, on September 26, 2003, Apache repurchased and retired preferred interests issued by three of its subsidiaries for approximately $443 million, plus an additional $1 million for accrued dividends and distributions. The Company also filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows Apache to sell up to $1.5 billion in stock and debt securities. On September 12, 2003 the Company announced that its Board of Directors, in recognition of the Companys outstanding growth and progress, voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock 20 percent to 6 cents per share from 5 cents per share, effective with the November 2003 payment, and to split the stock two for one. While 2003 was an outstanding year, the current outlook for 2004 is also encouraging. Recent drilling successes and acquisitions should generate substantial production. Also, the current NYMEX futures markets indicate oil and natural gas prices above historical averages in 2004. Lastly, we are well positioned to access capital should appropriate acquisition opportunities present themselves. A more detailed discussion of operations follows our Critical Accounting Policies. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other 18 assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. See Results of Operations and Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management. Full Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Operations The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful efforts method, costs such as geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and delay rentals, are expensed as incurred where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method the net book value (full cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period. We have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments. Typically, the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting. The Company has taken note of a July 2003 inquiry to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regarding whether or not contract based oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contract ("mineral rights") should be recorded or disclosed as intangible assets. The inquiry presents a view that these mineral rights are intangible assets as defined in SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and, therefore, should be classified separately on the balance sheet as intangible assets. SFAS No. 141, and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became effective for transactions subsequent to June 30, 2001 with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 142 required as of January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets. Under the statement, intangible assets should be separately reported on the face of the balance sheet and accompanied by disclosure in the notes to financial statements. SFAS No. 142 scopes out accounting utilized by the oil and gas industry as prescribed by SFAS No. 19, and is silent about whether or not its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas companies. Apache does not believe that SFAS No. 141 or 142 change the classification of oil and gas mineral rights and the Company continues to classify these assets as part of oil and gas properties. The 19 Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) has added the treatment of oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda, which may result in a change in how Apache classifies these assets. Should such a change be required, the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after June 30, 2001 that would be classified as "intangible undeveloped mineral interest" was $78 million and $259 million as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after June 30, 2001 that would be classified as "intangible developed mineral interest" was $332 million and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Intangible developed mineral interest amounts are presented net of accumulated DD&A. Accumulated DD&A was estimated using historical depletion rates applied proportionately to the costs of the acquisitions to be classified as "intangible developed mineral interest". The amounts noted above only include mineral rights acquired in business combinations or major asset purchases, and exclude those acquired individually or in groups as we have not historically tracked these in this manner. The Company has also not historically tracked the amount of mineral rights in the proved property balances related to producing leases or relinquished leases. We are currently identifying a methodology to do so for transactions subsequent to June 30, 2001. The numbers above are based on our understanding of the issue before the EITF, if all mineral rights associated with unevaluated property and producing reserves were deemed to be intangible assets: mineral rights with proved reserves that were acquired after June 30, 2001 and mineral rights with no proved reserves would be classified as intangible assets and would not be included in oil and gas properties on our consolidated balance sheet; results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected because mineral rights would continue to be amortized in accordance with full cost accounting rules; and disclosures required by SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 relative to intangibles would be included in the notes to our financial statements. If the accounting for mineral rights is ultimately changed, transitional guidance for intangible assets permits the reclassification of only amounts acquired after the effective date of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 if records were not previously maintained to track acquisition costs based on their intangible or tangible nature. Lack of these records prior to the effective date could result in the loss of comparability between historical balances of tangible and intangible asset balances and among companies in the industry. Reserve Estimates Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a "ceiling" limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, their review covered 78, 68 and 61 percent of the reserve value, respectively. 20 Bad Debt Expense We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties of which we are the operator. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings. Generally, our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months. However, during 2001 and 2002, we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our oil and gas sales. Deteriorating economic conditions during 2001 and 2002 in Egypt lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in an additional one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. While hard currency shortages in Egypt could lead to further delays, we did not experience any further delays in 2003. Please refer to the Future Trends section in this Item 7 for additional discussion concerning our Egyptian receivables. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. Asset Retirement Obligation The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Prior to 2003, under the full cost method of accounting, as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections, the estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations, net of the value of salvage, were included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties. In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." Apache adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as discussed in Note 2 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. SFAS No. 143 significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets ("asset retirement obligations" or "ARO"). Primarily, the new statement requires the Company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the Companys asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations. SFAS No. 143 requires a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception. The Company, therefore, calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the ARO liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance. The sum of these cumulative expenses was compared to the depletion expense originally recorded. Because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under SFAS No. 143, the difference resulted in a gain which the Company recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. Upon implementation, the Company also had to determine if the statement required us to recalculate our historical full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K). The Company chose not to re calculate its historical full cost ceiling tests even though its historical oil and gas property balances would have been higher had we applied the statement from inception. We believe this approach is appropriate because SFAS No. 143 is silent on this issue and was not effective during the prior impairment test periods. Had a recalculation of the historical full cost ceiling test resulted in impairment, the charge would have reduced the gain recorded upon adoption. 21 Going forward, our depletion expense will be reduced since we will deplete a discounted ARO rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted. The lower depletion expense under SFAS No. 143 is offset, however, by accretion expense, which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time. Also, the Company had to determine how to incorporate the asset retirement obligations into the quarterly calculation of its full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K). SFAS No. 143 is silent with respect to this issue and, although there are various views, the Company elected to continue including the undiscounted ARO as part of future development costs, essentially reducing the present value of its future net revenues and full cost ceiling limit. To compare the property balance, which included the ARO component, to the full cost ceiling limit, which has been reduced by a similar abandonment cost, we netted the ARO liability against the property balance. The Company believes its view is appropriate since there must be a comparable basis between the net book value of the properties and the full cost ceiling limitation. Another widely contemplated view is to exclude the ARO from future development costs when calculating the full cost ceiling limitation and not reduce the carrying amount of capitalized costs by the related liability. This approach would result in a higher full cost ceiling limitation and a comparatively higher net oil and gas property balance. Income Taxes Oil and gas exploration and production is a global business. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). We intend to permanently reinvest earnings from our international operations; therefore, we do not recognize deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, we would then reflect taxes on those earnings. Derivatives Apache uses commodity derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and accounts for the contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133). The estimated fair values of Apaches derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. For contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. SFAS 133 requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be "marked to market" and reported in current period income, rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. The Company does not currently enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. The estimate of fair value of Apaches derivative contracts requires substantial judgment; however, the Companys derivative contracts are generally exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities that are traded in highly liquid markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data. Option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations. (see Commodity Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10 K for commodity price sensitivity information). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section includes a discussion of our 2003 and 2002 results of operations. Apache has six reportable segments, which are the United States, Canada, Australia, Egypt, the North Sea and Other International. 22 These segments are primarily in the business of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Please refer to Note 14 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for segment information. Acquisitions and Divestitures In 2003, we spent $1.6 billion on oil and gas acquisitions, adding 267 MMboe to our reserve base. The preponderance of our 2003 acquisition activity was focused in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The North Sea assets further diversified our reserves and production, while the Gulf of Mexico properties provide opportunities in an area that historically enjoys the highest netback natural gas pricing in North America. Seventy two percent of our acquisition capital was spent to acquire North Sea and Gulf of Mexico properties from BP. Another 13 percent was spent to acquire additional Gulf of Mexico properties from Shell. The balance of our activity involved smaller acquisitions in Australia and North America. The North Sea acquisition establishes a new international operating region for Apache, providing the potential for future internal growth. The Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from BP and Shell lay down well with our existing Gulf of Mexico properties and provide promising prospects for future exploration, exploitation and development activities. As we have in the past, we expect to identify and take advantage of efficiencies in field operations and economics of scale, while concurrently accelerating production and adding reserves. In association with the BP acquisition, Apache agreed to sell all of the production from the North Sea properties to BP for a two year period at a combination of fixed and market sensitive prices pursuant to a contract entered into in connection with the North Sea purchase agreement. To protect the acquisition economics on the Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from BP we hedged prices on a substantial portion of the oil production for a 12 month period ending January 31, 2004, and a substantial portion of the gas production for the first two years (see Note 4 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Prior to the Shell transaction, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (Morgan Stanley) paid Shell $300 million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in a portion of the reserves to be produced over the next four years. Shells sale of an overriding royalty interest to Morgan Stanley is commonly known in the industry as a volumetric production payment (VPP). Under the terms of the VPP, Morgan Stanley is to receive a fixed volume of oil and gas production over the four year term. The VPP reserves and production will not be recorded by Apache. In addition, a $60 million liability for the future cost to produce and deliver volumes subject to the VPP has been recorded by the Company because the overriding royalties are not burdened by production costs. This liability will be amortized as the volumes are produced and delivered to Morgan Stanley. In 2002, we elected to exercise patience on the acquisition front, in anticipation of lower acquisition prices. We focused our attention on managing our financial structure by building equity and paying down debt so we would be in a position to act quickly when attractive assets became available at reasonable prices. Our oil and gas acquisitions in 2002 totaled approximately $350 million, adding 49 MMboe to our reserve base, far short of the $880 million we expended during 2001, which added 213 MMboe of proved reserves. In addition, the acquisitions added $3 million and $146 million of production, processing and transportation facilities in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and $197 million of goodwill in 2001. Seventy five percent of our 2002 acquisition activity occurred in the U.S. and was related to the acquisition of properties primarily located in two Southern Louisiana parishes. The balance of our 2002 acquisitions primarily related to two acquisitions in Canada. In connection with our 2002 South Louisiana acquisition, we entered into costless collar hedges to protect Apache from the potential for falling gas prices and to protect the economics of the transaction. These hedges are consistent with some of our 2001 and 2000 acquisitions, whereby we entered into and assumed fixed price commodity swaps and costless collars that protected Apache from falling commodity prices. This enabled us to better predict the financial performance of our acquisitions. See Note 4 of Item 15 for the terms of the Companys hedging activity. 23 Our acquisitions over the last three years helped us maintain diversity in terms of hydrocarbon product (oil or gas), geologic risk and geographic location. As shown in Note 15 of this Form 10 K, our 2003 year end international reserves as a percentage of total reserves climbed to 30 percent from 22 percent at year end 2002, while our international average daily production remained constant at 36 percent of our total production in both 2003 and 2002. Our hydrocarbon product mix on a boe basis in 2003 remained relatively constant at 49 percent natural gas and 51 percent oil, compared to 51 percent natural gas and 49 percent oil in 2002. While the U.S., a highly stable environment, remains our largest producing core area, Apache will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in existing core areas and in new areas should they arise. Note that, in light of the uncertainty of how the collapse of Enron Corp. would impact the derivatives markets, we closed all of our derivatives positions in October and November 2001, most of which were associated with prior acquisitions, recognizing a net gain in 2001 of $10 million with additional gains and losses to be recognized over the original life of the hedge. A net gain of $24 million was recognized in 2002 and a $4 million net loss was recognized in 2003. These, as well as the unwinding of our gas price swaps associated with advances from gas purchasers, increased the Companys average natural gas price by $.02 per Mcf during 2003, $.04 per Mcf during 2002 and $.09 per Mcf during 2001. They increased our average crude oil price by $.03 per bbl during 2003, $.15 per bbl during 2002, and reduced our average crude oil price by $.42 per bbl during 2001. There is no material affect in future periods related to closed derivative positions. We routinely evaluate our property portfolio and divest those that are marginal or no longer fit into our strategic growth program. We divested $59 million, $7 million and $348 million of properties during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on the prices we receive for our production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while other economic factors could impact demand. Oil and Natural Gas Prices While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a world wide market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions. Apache sells its natural gas into three markets; 1) North America, which has a common market and where production is currently in short supply relative to demand. 2) Australia, which has a local market with limited demand and infrastructure. 3) Egypt, which has a local market and where the price received for the majority of our production is currently indexed to a weighted average Dated Brent crude oil price. For specific marketing arrangements by segment, please refer to Item 1, Business of this Form 10 K. Contributions to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues As with production and reserves, a consequence of geographic diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues and natural gas revenues. For the reasons discussed in the Oil and Natural Gas Price section above, contributions to oil revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately. 24 The following table presents each segments oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues, respectively. OIL REVENUES GAS REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 United States....................................... 33% 35% 40% 62% 51% 61% Canada.............................................. 13% 16% 17% 27% 29% 27% North America....................................... 46% 51% 57% 89% 80% 88% Egypt............................................... 23% 29% 27% 8% 15% 8% Australia........................................... 16% 20% 16% 3% 5% 4% North Sea........................................... 13% Other International................................. 2% Total........................................ 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% Crude Oil Contribution In 2003 oil revenues from areas outside the U.S. rose to approximately 67 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 65 percent in 2002. The increase is directly related to the acquisition of the North Sea properties and, to a much lesser extent, initial production from China. The percentage contribution from all other areas fell, reflecting the impact from the North Sea revenues and China revenues. In 2002, oil revenues outside the U.S. reached approximately 65 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 60 percent in 2001. This increase primarily occurred in Egypt and Australia where crude oil revenues rose to 29 percent and 20 percent of total oil revenues, respectively. Canada contributed 16 percent of oil revenue, down from 17 percent in 2001. Natural Gas Contribution The preponderance of consolidated natural gas revenues comes from our North American operations. In 2003, 89 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from North America, 62 percent from the U.S. and 27 percent from Canada. The U.S. contribution rose 11 percent from 2002, primarily because of the properties acquired from BP and Shell in 2003, and properties acquired in South Louisiana in December 2002. Our U.S. Gulf Coast region, which contributed 71 percent of Apaches U.S. 2003 production, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial production rates followed by steep declines when compared to most other U.S. producing areas. Higher U.S. natural gas prices also contributed, but to a much lesser extent. Canadas contribution was down two percent from 2002 primarily because of the production growth in the U.S. Egypts contribution to total gas revenues declined to eight percent from 15 percent in 2002. Egypts total natural gas revenues were relatively flat year over year, as additional revenues generated from higher natural gas prices were offset by lower production generated revenues. Australias contribution to 2003 natural gas revenues declined to three percent from five percent in 2002. In 2002, 80 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from the North American market, 51 percent from the U.S. and 29 percent from Canada. The remaining 20 percent was split between Egypt, 15 percent, and Australia, 5 percent. 25 The table below presents oil and gas production revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids.

Higher production added the remaining $230 million. Virtually all of the additional revenues attributable to price came from the U.S. and Canada. The additional revenues attributable to production were concentrated in the U.S., where natural gas production increased 32 percent, reflecting the impact from the 2003 BP and Shell acquisitions and the December 2002 acquisition of the South Louisiana properties. Partially offsetting the additional U.S. production revenues were lower production in Egypt, Australia and Canada, down seven percent, six percent and three percent, respectively. Egypts lower production related to gas production curtailment imposed by EGPC and scheduled plant shutdowns, while Australia saw lower customer demand. Consolidated natural gas revenues declined $391 million in 2002, consistent with an $.83 per Mcf decline in the weighted average realized price for natural gas and a four percent decline in production. The price decline reduced revenues by $342 million, while lower gas production reduced revenues by another $49 million. A gas production decline of 18 percent was experienced in the U.S., with declines of 21 percent and 13 percent in the Gulf Coast and Central regions, respectively. The Gulf Coast region, which contributed 61.5 percent of Apaches U.S. 2002 production, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial rates followed by steep declines when compared to other US producing regions. Natural decline coupled with capital curtailments, property sales in late 2001 and back to back hurricanes in September and October 2002 contributed to the production decline in the U.S. Collectively, Canada, Egypt, Australia and Argentina saw a 13 percent increase in natural gas production. Canadas increase was the result of previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity, coupled with successful results at Ladyfern, which offset natural decline at Zama. Egypts increase also came from previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. We have used long term, fixed price physical contracts to lock in a small portion of our domestic future natural gas production. The contracts provide a measure of protection to the Company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices and represented approximately nine and 11 percent of our 2003 and 2002 domestic natural gas production, respectively. In 2003, these contracts reduced our average realized price $.08 per Mcf. In 2002, these contracts added $.01 per Mcf. Additionally, substantially all of our natural gas production sold in Australia is subject to long term fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in Australias consumer price index. Our realized prices are also impacted by a change in the value of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. In 2003, we saw an increase in our realized prices primarily because of the stronger Australian dollar. Crude Oil Revenues Our 2003 consolidated oil revenues increased $698 million with a 34 percent increase in oil production generating an additional $531 million of revenues. Crude oil prices improved in all areas, pushing our worldwide weighted average crude oil price up $2.98 per barrel, adding the remaining $167 million. Revenues from properties acquired in the North Sea accounted for over half of the increase in oil revenues attributable to production. A portion of the revenue from the North Sea is tied to a separate crude oil physical sales contract entered into in conjunction with the acquisition. See Note 4 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the terms of this contract. Production in the U.S. increased 31 percent, primarily from the Gulf of Mexico BP properties and to a lesser extent from properties acquired from Shell and in South Louisiana in December 2002. Initial production from China and a nine percent increase in production from Egypt also contributed to the revenue gains. Oil revenues improved $137 million in 2002 with both a higher realized price and higher production. The weighted average realized price for oil improved $1.60 per barrel, adding $86 million to oil revenues, while oil production gains added another $51 million. The price improvement was across the board, while production gains of 29 percent and 12 percent occurred in Australia and Egypt, respectively. The Legendre, Simpson and Gibson/South Plato developments drove Australias gain, while Egypts increase was related to the Repsol acquisition in 2001 and subsequent drilling. U.S. production declined nine percent related to natural decline, 27 back to back hurricanes in late September and early October and property sales. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. Operating Expenses The tables below present a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference either expenses on a boe basis or expenses on an absolute dollar basis, or both, depending on their relevance. During 2003, we saw tremendous growth in production and reserves accompanied by a corresponding rise in operating costs. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 (IN MILLIONS) (PER BOE) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment...... $1,003 $ 784 $ 760 $ 6.59 $ 6.29 $ 6.05 Other assets............................ 70 60 61 .46 .48 .48 Asset retirement obligation accretion..... 38 .25 International impairments................. 13 20 65 .08 .16 .52 Lease operating costs..................... 700 458 400 4.59 3.67 3.18 Gathering and transportation costs........ 60 38 35 .40 .31 .28 Severance and other taxes................. 122 67 75 .80 .54 .59 General and administrative expenses....... 138 105 89 .91 .84 .71 Financing costs, net...................... 115 113 118 .75 .91 .95 Total................................ $2,259 $1,645 $1,603 $14.83 $13.20 $12.76 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Apaches full cost DD&A expense is driven by many factors including certain costs incurred in the exploration, development, and acquisition of producing reserves, production levels, and estimates of proved reserve quantities and future developmental costs. 2003 full cost DD&A expense of $1 billion is comprised of the U.S., $489 million; Canada, $158 million; Egypt, $161 million; Australia, $110 million; the North Sea, $72 million; and China, $12 million. Full cost DD&A expense increased $220 million compared to 2002. The majority of the increase in absolute costs was in the U.S., up $119 million; and the North Sea, $72 million; related to increases in production driven by our recent acquisitions. First production in China added $12 million. The remaining increase is concentrated in Egypt and Australia. On a boe basis, our average full cost DD&A rate in 2003 increased $.30 to $6.59 from $6.29 in 2002. The bulk of the increase occurred in Australia, Egypt and the U.S. contributing $.12, $.09 and $.06, respectively. The increases in Australia and Egypt reflect the impact of higher finding and development costs, while the increase in the U.S. reflects the impact of higher finding and development costs and higher acquisition costs. China and the North Sea each added $.03, while Canadas rate lowered the consolidated rate $.03. In 2002, our full cost DD&A expense increased $24 million. Areas outside the U.S. saw an increase in their expense, while DD&A expense decreased in the U.S. The areas experiencing the largest increase in absolute costs were Egypt, up $29 million and Australia, up $24 million (consistent with their overall increase in production), while the U.S. experienced a $39 million decline in full cost DD&A expense on lower production levels. Canada also had higher DD&A expense of $7 million relating to higher production levels. On a boe basis our 2002 full cost DD&A rate rose $.24 to $6.29. The U.S. contributed $.13 to the increase in rate, driven by higher finding costs and higher future development costs. The remaining increase in the consolidated rate is split between Egypt and Australia. The impact from Egypt is related to higher finding and development costs. The impact from Australia is primarily related to higher future development costs. Depreciation of other assets increased $10 million, in 2003 in line with our overall growth. 28 Impairments We assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of acreage. When an impairment occurs, costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. In some of our international exploration plays, however, we have not yet established proved reserves. As such, any impairments in these areas are immediately charged to earnings. During 2001, we impaired a portion of our unproved property costs in Poland and China by $65 million ($41 million after tax). In 2002, we impaired an additional $20 million in Poland ($12 million after tax). In 2003, we impaired the remaining $13 million ($8 million after tax) of unproved property costs in Poland. Goodwill is subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment beginning in 2002. Goodwill totals $189 million at December 31, 2003 and no impairment was recorded in 2003 or 2002. For further discussion, see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Lease Operating Costs Lease operating costs (LOE) is generally comprised of several components; direct operating costs, repair and maintenance costs, workover costs and ad valorem costs. LOE is driven in part by the type of commodity produced, the level of workover activity and the geographical location of the properties. Oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy. They enable us to exploit our existing reserves by accelerating production and taking advantage of high priced environments. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with plants and facilities. During 2003, the Company saw a substantial increase in its LOE costs on both an absolute dollar basis and boe basis. The majority of the increase on an absolute dollar basis was expected, given the BP and Shell acquisitions and the acquisition of the South Louisiana properties. On a boe basis, 2003 LOE increased $.92 to $4.59, with all of the increase occurring outside the U.S. The North Sea properties, which are located offshore and produce oil, added approximately $109 million of costs, increasing our consolidated rate $.46 per boe. Canadas LOE costs increased $44 million, adding $.30 to our consolidated boe rate. The impact from a weaker U.S. dollar, a full year of LOE on properties acquired in the second half of 2002, costs associated with new fields, and higher power and fuel rates drove the increase in Canadian costs. Egypts operating costs increased $13 million, adding $.09 to the overall rate. The majority of the increase in Egypt was attributable to higher workover activity. Australias LOE increased $7 million because of an increase in repair and maintenance and higher oil production. Australia added $.10 to the overall boe rate. The LOE rate in the U.S. declined as the impact from the additional costs associated with the acquisitions discussed above were more than offset by the incremental production. The U.S. reduced the overall rate by $.05 per boe. During 2002, LOE was $3.67 per boe, a $.49 increase from 2001. Higher absolute costs accounted for 94 percent, $.46 per boe, of this rate increase, with lower production accounting for the remaining $.03 per boe. We experienced higher absolute costs in the Gulf Coast region, Egypt and Canada. In the Gulf Coast region increased repairs and maintenance, related to both routine operations and hurricane repairs, generally higher costs on properties operated by others on offshore Gulf of Mexico properties and increased workover activity in the region, contributed to higher LOE. In Egypt, higher workover activity on the Khalda, South Umbarka and East Bahariya concessions drove up LOE. In Canada, the increased costs reflect the impact of the Fletcher, Conoco and Burlington acquisitions, which carry higher production costs than our other operations, and increased workover activity, with the heaviest activity at House Mountain, Hatton, Zama and Simonette fields. Gathering and Transportation Costs During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." Prior to adoption, amounts paid to third parties for transportation had been reported as a reduction of revenue instead of an increase in operating expenses. Recent property acquisitions and their associated transportation arrangements have increased the significance of transportation costs paid to 29 third parties. For comparative purposes, previously reported transportation costs paid to third parties were reclassified as corresponding increases to oil and gas production revenues and operating expenses with no impact on income attributable to common stock. Apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two types of transactions, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which Apache sells oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collects a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. Under the other arrangement, Apache sells oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pays transportation to a carrier and receives from the purchaser a price with no transportation deduction. In both the U.S. and Canada, Apache sells oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, Apache pays transportation to a carrier and receives a purchase price with no transportation deduction. In Egypt and Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under the netback arrangement. Gathering and transportation costs disclosed here only include transportation paid by Apache to a carrier. These costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our North American operations. In 2003, these costs totaled $28 million in Canada and $21 million in the U.S., up from $21 million and $17 million in 2002, respectively. The increase in Canada primarily involved higher third party transportation charges for gas transported from several fields and increased production volumes from 2002 acquisitions. Canada also incurred transportation charges for crude oil as we began taking our oil "in kind" and marketing it ourselves instead of selling it at the lease. The increase in the U.S. is related to the higher production from the Gulf of Mexico acquisitions. In the North Sea, these costs are related to the transportation of crude oil and totaled $11 million in 2003. Overall, transportation costs in 2002 were relatively flat to 2001. Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes are comprised primarily of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia. In both 2003 and 2002, these severance taxes, which are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, represented over 60 percent of the total severance and other taxes expense incurred. The other tax component is primarily made up of the Australian Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), to which Apache first became subject in 2002, the Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) on the North Sea properties and the Canadian Large Corporation Tax, Saskatchewan Capital Tax, Saskatchewan Resource Surtax and Freehold Mineral Tax. Oil and gas production revenues generated from Egypt, Canada and the North Sea are not subject to severance taxes. In 2003, severance and other taxes totaled $122 million ($53 million in the U.S., $28 million in Australia, $20 million in the North Sea, $20 million in Canada and $1 million in Argentina). Severance and other taxes increased 81 percent or $54 million. Twenty million dollars of the increase is associated with North Seas PRT expense. Canadian taxes increased $10 million as a result of exchange rate increases and higher prices in 2003, and a $2 million refund in 2002. U.S. and Australia severance taxes increased $17 million and $7 million, respectively, in line with higher production revenues. In 2002, severance and other taxes totaled $67 million, comprised of U.S., $35 million, Australia, $23 million and Canada, $9 million. Overall, severance and other taxes decreased $7 million. A $14 million decline in U.S. severance taxes, and a $3 million decline in Canada Saskatchewan Resource Surtax were partially offset by initial PRRT of $4 million and a $7 million increase in Australian severance taxes. The decrease in U.S. severance taxes reflects the impact of lower gas price realizations. The increase in Australias severance taxes was attributable to higher oil price realizations and a change in production mix as a higher portion of production was from properties in provincial waters, such as Legendre and Harriet, relative to production from federal waters. Canadas decline was primarily related to a refund of the Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses (G&A) of $.91 per boe for 2003 increased $.07 per boe over 2002. Absolute costs increased $34 million, or 32 percent. Over $11 million, or 34 percent, is associated with expensing compensation, including Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), stock options, restricted stock and 30 incremental incentive compensation, in light of our record year. The increased stock compensation expense stems from Apaches decision to expense stock related compensation plans (see Note 9 in Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Approximately $9 million, or 28 percent, of the increase is related to our new North Sea operations. The balance of the increase was related to the Companys decision to increase its charitable contributions, expansion of the Companys new gas marketing group and transition costs incurred on acquisitions. Overall, general and administrative expenses trended higher in 2002, rising $.13 to $.84 per boe. On an absolute cost basis, thirty eight percent of the increase is tied to rising medical costs, a sharp increase in premiums on business insurance policies renewed subsequent to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the addition of a sizeable political risk insurance package added in mid 2001. The remaining increase is related to non recurring employee separation costs, a consequence of our region realignment in the U.S., higher outside legal support costs related to arbitration proceedings with our gas marketer, Cinergy and litigation with Predator (see Note 11 of this Form 10 K), costs associated with the implementation of and compliance with various sections of Sarbanes Oxley, and a full year of expense related to additional staff and office costs incurred with the acquisition of Canadian subsidiaries of Fletcher during 2001. Realignment of our three U.S. regions into two involved both reassignment and reduction of personnel. All corresponding costs were expensed as incurred. Financing Costs, Net The major components of net financing costs are interest expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs increased $2 million compared to 2002 with a $13 million increase in expense largely offset by an increase in capitalized interest. Five million dollars of the increase is interest expense related to the write off of unamortized fees triggered by the retirement of preferred interests of subsidiaries discussed below. The remaining $8 million of higher interest expense was attributable to a higher average debt balance in 2003 compared to 2002. Capitalized interest increased $12 million driven by a higher unproved property balance associated with acquisitions and an active drilling program. If net financing costs included distributions from Preferred Interests of Subsidiaries, net financing costs would have decreased by approximately $5 million. Net financing costs decreased by five percent in 2002. Lower average debt outstanding during 2002 resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $23 million compared to 2001. A reduction in capitalized interest of $16 million, associated with lower unproved property balances, partially offset this decrease. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2003 was 6.4 percent compared to 6.3 percent on December 31, 2002. The rate is higher at year end 2003 as a lower percentage of our debt is at floating rates, which carry a lower rate than fixed rate debt. Provision for Income Taxes 2003 income tax expense of $827 million was $482 million or 140 percent higher than the 2002. The higher taxes were primarily associated with higher income in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate increased primarily because of $172 million of additional deferred tax expenses resulting from currency fluctuations. For a discussion of Apaches sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations, please refer to "Foreign Currency Risk" under Item 7A of this Form 10 K. The impact caused by currency fluctuations was partially offset by a $71 million reduction in deferred tax expense related to a reduction in Canadian federal statutory income tax rates. Our effective tax rate for 2003 was 43.02 percent compared to 38.34 percent for the prior year. Our 2002 effective tax rate was slightly lower than 2001. 31 OIL AND GAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 (IN THOUSANDS) Exploration and Development: United States............................................ $ 439,541 $302,611 $ 699,180 Canada................................................... 579,495 258,191 410,345 Egypt.................................................... 242,652 171,160 127,603 Australia................................................ 128,261 89,813 85,169 North Sea................................................ 60,204 Other International...................................... 35,098 38,409 20,838 $1,485,251 $860,184 $1,343,135 Capitalized Interest....................................... $ 52,891 $ 40,691 $ 56,749 Gas Gathering Transmission and Processing Facilities....... $ 38,533 $ 32,155 $ 28,759 Acquisitions: Oil and gas properties................................... $1,568,106 $351,707 $ 880,286 Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities.... 5,484 2,875 146,295 Goodwill................................................. 197,200 $1,573,590 $354,582 $1,223,781 In 2003, Apache added 503.2 MMboe of proved reserves through acquisitions, drilling and revisions, replacing 330 percent of production. In 2002, Apache added 172.1 MMboe of proved reserves through acquisitions, drilling and revisions, replacing 138 percent of production. The preliminary capital expenditure budget for 2004 is approximately $1.8 billion (excluding acquisitions), including $1 billion for North America. Preliminary North American capital expenditures include $400 million in the Gulf Coast region, $100 million in the Central region and $500 million in Canada. The Company has estimated its international capital expenditures in 2004 at $800 million. Capital expenditures will be reviewed periodically, and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions. CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS Apache paid a total of $6 million in dividends during 2003 on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock were paid through May 15, 2002, when the shares automatically converted to common stock (see Note 9, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Common dividends paid during 2003 rose 19 percent to $67 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 39 consecutive years through 2003. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 20 percent, to six cents per share from five cents per share, effective with the November 2003 dividend payment. CAPITAL RESOURCES Apaches primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flows. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices, drilling and acquisition costs, and cash flow. The Company has 32 historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities, debt, preferred interests of subsidiaries and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all other cash needs. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2003 totaled $2.7 billion, an increase of 96 percent from 2002 driven by higher oil and gas production revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses. Oil production revenues increased with a 34 percent increase in production and a 12 percent increase in prices. Gas production revenues increased with a 13 percent production increase and a 61 percent price increase. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 decreased 28 percent to $1.4 billion from $1.9 billion in 2001. The decrease was driven by lower oil and gas production revenues and slightly higher operating expenses. Oil and gas production revenues fell with a 22 percent decline in gas prices, which was partially offset by a seven percent improvement in oil prices. The impact of lower gas production was partially offset by rising oil production. Debt At December 31, 2003, Apache had outstanding debt of $135 million under its commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit and a total of $2.2 billion of other debt. This other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years 2005 through 2096. Based on our current plan for capital spending and projections of debt and interest rates, interest payments on the Companys debt for 2004 are projected to be $160 million (using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations). On June 3, 2002, Apache entered into a new $1.5 billion global credit facility to replace its existing global and 364 day credit facilities. The new global credit facility consists of four separate bank facilities: a $750 million 364 day facility in the United States; a $450 million five year facility in the United States; a $150 million five year facility in Australia; and a $150 million five year facility in Canada. Loans under the global credit facility do not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The five year facilities are scheduled to mature on June 3, 2007 and the 364 day facility is currently scheduled to mature on May 28, 2004. The 364 day facility allows the Company the option to convert outstanding revolving loans at maturity into one year term loans. The Company may request extensions of the maturity dates subject to approval of the lenders. Please see Note 6 "Debt" of Item 15 for a summary of the financial covenants of the global credit facility. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets (with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens), restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee the debt of entities not within our consolidated group. The Company has a $1.2 billion commercial paper program which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper balances at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such amounts on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under the U.S. five year facility and the 364 day facility. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. five year credit facility and 364 day credit facility are available as a 100 percent backstop. The weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was 1.19 percent in 2003 and 1.85 percent in 2002. Preferred Interests of Subsidiaries During 2001, several of our subsidiaries issued a total of $443 million ($441 million, net of issuance costs) of preferred stock and limited partner interests to unrelated institutional investors, adding to the Companys financial liquidity. We paid a weighted average return to the investors of 123 basis points above the prevailing LIBOR interest rate. These subsidiaries were consolidated in the accompanying financial 33 statements with the $437 million at December 31, 2002 reflected as preferred interests of subsidiaries on the balance sheet. On September 26, 2003, Apache repurchased and retired the preferred interests issued by three of its subsidiaries for approximately $443 million, plus an additional $1 million for accrued dividends and distributions. The transactions involved the purchase of preferred stock issued by two of the Companys subsidiaries for approximately $82 million and the retirement of a limited partnership interest in a partnership controlled by a subsidiary of the Company for approximately $361 million. Apache funded the transactions with available cash on hand and by issuing commercial paper under its existing commercial paper facility. Stock Transactions On September 13, 2001, our Board of Directors declared a 10 percent stock dividend payable on January 21, 2002 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2001. As a result, we reclassified approximately $545 million from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital, which represents the fair market value at the date of declaration of the shares distributed. No fractional shares were issued and cash payments totaling $891,000 were made in lieu of fractional shares. On May 15, 2002, we completed the mandatory conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock into approximately 13.1 million common shares. On December 18, 2002, our Board of Directors declared a five percent stock dividend payable on April 2, 2003 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. As a result, in December 2002, we reclassified approximately $396 million from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital, which represents the fair market value at the date of declaration of the shares distributed. In 2003, at the date of the distribution, an additional $26 million was reclassified from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital. No fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares. On January 22, 2003, we completed a public offering of approximately 19.8 million shares of common stock, including 2.6 million shares for the underwriters over allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million. On December 18, 2003, we announced that holders of our common stock approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to 430 million from 215 million in order to complete a previously announced two for one stock split. The record date for the stock split was December 31, 2003 and the additional shares were distributed on January 14, 2004. LIQUIDITY During 2003, we strengthened our financial flexibility and continued to build upon the solid financial performances of previous years. Cash will be required to fund expenditures necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves typical in an extractive industry like ours. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and our success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. We believe that cash on hand, net cash generated from operating activities, and unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy future financial obligations and liquidity needs. Net cash generated from operating activities is a function of commodity prices, which are inherently volatile and unpredictable, production and capital spending. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will shrink, as stated in Item 1, "Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations". Based on the year end reserve life index, the Companys overall decline is approximately nine percent per year. This projection assumes the capital investment, prices, costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in Item 15 Note 15, of this Form 10 K. Less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and, therefore, capital budgets. 34 For these reasons, we only forecast, for internal use by management, an annual cash flow. These annual forecasts are revised monthly and capital budgets are reviewed by management and adjusted as warranted by market conditions. Longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are neither developed nor used by management to operate our business. As of December 31, 2003, available borrowing capacity under our global credit facility was $1.4 billion. We had $34 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2003, a decrease from $52 million at the prior year end. In addition, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased from 1.44 at the end of last year to 1.10 at December 31, 2003. We have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Please see the indicated Note to the Companys consolidated financial statements, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations.

Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003, the Company recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation. See Note 2, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. (b) This table does not include the Companys pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 11 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations. The Company has reserved approximately $10 million for environmental remediation. The Companys exposure to other legal contingent liabilities is estimated at less than $8 million and is fully reserved. The Company does not believe it has any material exposure for any contingencies (see Note 11 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Upon closing of our acquisition of the North Sea properties, Apache will assume BPs abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, does not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache does not satisfy the abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to ensure Apaches payment of these costs, Apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moodys and 35 Standard and Poors from the Companys current ratings of A3 and A , respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change. If Apache is obligated to provide a letter of credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level. The initial letter of credit amount would be 175 million British pounds ($306 million U.S. at December 31, 2003). This amount represents the letter of credit requirement through March 2004, and will be negotiated annually based on Apaches future abandonment obligation estimates. In addition, under Apaches long term oil physical sales contract with BP, related to the BP acquisition, Apache may be required to post margin if the mark to market exposure, as defined, exceeds the credit threshold limits. The outstanding position of the term oil physical sales contract with BP is described in greater detail in Note 4 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K. The Companys future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys; however, we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely. The Companys global credit facility does not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail within the debt section of our discussion on Capital Resources above. In addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements, Apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the Companys credit ratings decline significantly. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose. Any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements would be scrutinized and disclosed by the Companys management. FUTURE TRENDS Apaches strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves: exploiting our existing asset base; acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value; and investing in high potential exploration prospects. Apaches present plans are to increase 2004 worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling to approximately $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion in 2003. We will continue to monitor commodity prices and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly. We will also continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities. Exploiting Existing Asset Base Apache seeks to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while containing operating costs per unit. In order to achieve these objectives, we rigorously pursue production enhancement opportunities such as workovers, recompletions and moderate risk drilling, while divesting marginal and non strategic properties and identifying other activities to reduce costs. Our 2003 acquisitions from BP and Shell added to our inventory at a time of high commodity prices. Acquiring Properties to Which We Can Add Incremental Value Apache seeks to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers. Our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, facilitating asset growth and debt reduction. We evaluate potential purchases on an ongoing basis, but we are very selective. Practically all of our 2003 acquisition activity was completed by early July. We remained in the market during the second half of 2003, but we did 36 not identify any assets that fit our balanced portfolio business model. We believe attractive assets will be available, as larger energy companies look to shed non core assets. Investing in High Potential Exploration Prospects Apache seeks to concentrate its exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions. We believe that these investments, although generally higher risk, offer potential for attractive investment returns and significant reserve additions. Our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy. They complement our North American operations, which are more development oriented. A critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility. All three rating agencies have "A credit ratings" on Apaches senior unsecured long term debt, a testament to our conservative financial structure and commitment to preserving a strong balance sheet while building a solid foundation and competitive advantage with which to pursue our growth initiatives. Egyptian Receivables Deteriorating economic conditions during 2001 and 2002 in Egypt lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in an additional one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. While hard currency shortages in Egypt could lead to further delays, we did not experience any further delays in 2003. It is currently our intention to resolve the delays in EGPCs payments prior to incurring the substantial capital expenditures required to develop our deepwater interests in the West Mediterranean Concession or signing the gas sales agreement provided for by the MOU for a minimum of 2.7 Tcf of natural gas over 25 years from such concession. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY RISK The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of $25.53 per barrel to a high of $31.66 per barrel during 2003. Average gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of $4.11 per Mcf to a monthly high of $6.66 per Mcf during the same period. Based on the Companys 2003 worldwide oil production levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by $75 million. Based on the Companys 2003 worldwide gas production levels, a $.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by $44 million. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes, do not exceed the "ceiling." This ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to additional DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities; however, as discussed above, sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures 37 contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As indicated in Notes 3 and 4, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K, the Company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with the South Louisiana acquisition in December 2002 and with the acquisition from BP in 2003. These positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices and were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated production. On December 31, 2003, the Company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of $(60) million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would change the fair value by $(32) million. A 10 percent decrease in prices would change the fair value by $31 million. The Company also had open oil price swap positions with a fair value of $(9) million. A 10 percent change in oil prices would change the fair value by plus or minus $5 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2003. See Note 4 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for notional volumes associated with the Companys derivative contracts. INTEREST RATE RISK Approximately 94 percent of the Companys yearend 2003 debt is term debt with fixed interest rates, minimizing the Companys exposure to fluctuations in short term interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the Company had $135 million of floating rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in the floating interest rate (approximately 11 basis points) on these year end balances, would change annual interest expense $148,000. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2003 or 2002. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, however, the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars and British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date. Prior to October 1, 2002, reported cash flow from Canadian operations was measured in Canadian dollars and converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported. The majority of Apaches debt in Canada is denominated in U.S. dollars and, as such, was adjusted for differences in exchange rates at each period end and recorded as Revenues and Other. In light of the continuing transformation of the U.S. and Canadian energy markets into a single energy market, we adopted the U.S. dollar as our functional currency in Canada, effective October 1, 2002. A 10 percent strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the British pound as of December 31, 2003 will result in a foreign currency net loss of approximately $66 million. This is primarily driven from foreign currency effects on the Companies deferred tax liability positions in its international operations. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2003 or 2002. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. 38 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices, may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Apache Corporation is an independent energy company whose principle business includes exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. During 2003 the Company added an additional international core area with the acquisition of the U.K. North Sea Forties Field from BP p.l.c. (BP). The Companys other core geographic areas include operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and Egypt. Smaller, non core operations are conducted in China and Argentina. Apache adheres to a portfolio approach to provide diversity in terms of hydrocarbon mix (crude oil and natural gas), geologic risk and geographic location. Our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through drilling, through acquisitions, or through a combination of both, depending on what the environment gives us. As we pursue growth, we continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet our future financial obligations and liquidity needs. These obligations and needs must be met with cash on hand, cash generated from our operations, unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility and the capital markets. The interest cost of debt and access to the equity markets are greatly influenced by a companys ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate ongoing operating cash flow. For these reasons, we strive to maintain a manageable debt load that is properly balanced with equity, and our single A credit ratings. We are also cognizant of the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves. Consequently, we must stay abreast of industry drilling costs and the price 16 at which properties are available for purchase, when choosing where to allocate our available funds. We monitor operating costs, on both an absolute dollar and per unit of production basis, relative to our historical norms and relative to our industry sector, factoring in the impact from property acquisitions and changes in industry conditions. Given the inherent volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices, and changing industry conditions, we frequently revise our forecasts and adjust our budgets accordingly. Commodity prices throughout 2003 were relatively high and remained consistently strong throughout the year. This price consistency allowed us to maintain a fairly constant level of capital expenditures for exploration and development drilling throughout the year. Our 2003 drilling and acquisition capital expenditures (discussed below) were balanced, as we grew both production and reserves to record levels, while maintaining a balance in terms of hydrocarbon mix. We had exceptional profitability growth in 2003, achieving several operational and financial milestones noted below: Our 2003 oil and gas production revenues reached a record $4.2 billion, 64 percent higher than in 2002. We generated record earnings of $1.1 billion, more than twice our prior year level. More importantly, on a diluted share basis earnings rose 91 percent to a record $3.43 per share. Cash from operating activities increased 96 percent from the prior year to a record $2.7 billion. Production averaged a record 417,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), the 24th increase in the last 25 years. In mid July 2003, production was initiated on the Zhao Dong block in Bohai Bay, offshore China. We began actively marketing our U.S. natural gas effective with July 2003 production. With our 2nd quarter North American daily natural gas production exceeding one billion cubic feet (Bcf), we felt it was prudent to bring this responsibility back in house. On December 16, 2003 we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) for a Gas Sales Agreement, Field Development Plan and Deepwater Development Lease for a minimum of 2.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas over 25 years from the deepwater portion of our Egyptian West Mediterranean Concession. Production is scheduled to commence in 2007, contingent upon completion of significant development infrastructure and resolution of delays in certain payments for production by EGPC. We ended the year with record proved reserves of 1.66 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), marking the 18th consecutive year of reserve growth. Nearly half of our proved reserve additions were added through exploration and development activities. We began our 49th year in a strong financial position and on January 13, 2003, we announced the BP acquisition, our single largest acquisition to date, establishing a new international core area and augmenting our Gulf of Mexico portfolio. The BP acquisition fit our balanced portfolio business model and provides the potential for internal growth similar to what we have experienced in other areas. It also extends our relationship with one of the worlds largest integrated major companies. In July 2003, we consummated a deal with Shell Exploration and Production Company (Shell) adding additional oil and gas fields on the outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Our total acquisition costs for 2003 were approximately $1.6 billion, compared to $355 million in the prior year. These acquisitions are discussed in more detail below. Our worldwide capital expenditures for exploration and development were approximately $1.5 billion, 73 percent higher than 2002 and approximately 18 percent higher than our initial plan. Our strong cash flow enabled us to allocate additional funds to exploration and development during 2003. We spent approximately 69 percent of our exploration and development capital in North America, which is consistent with reserve and production contributions. We had numerous drilling successes throughout the year, particularly in Egypt and Australia: Our most significant exploration success in Egypt, announced in July 2003, was the Qasr 1X well located on the Khalda Concession. In November, we announced completion of the Qasr 2X confirming the Qasr 1X discovery. We believe the Qasr discovery has the potential to be the most 17 significant discovery in Apaches 49 years. Production was initiated on a restricted basis in the fourth quarter of 2003, with full production expected in 2005, pending completion of additional development wells, appraisal wells and construction of pipeline facilities. In July 2003, we announced that our Ravensworth 1 well discovered oil in the Exmouth Sub Basin offshore Western Australia, creating a new oil play area for Apache in an oil prone area and adding a new dimension to our exploration program offshore Western Australia. Early in October 2003, we announced our second discovery in the Exmouth Sub Basin, the Crosby 1, providing additional confidence that we have established a new oil play area. Appraisal wells along with additional exploration drilling will occur in 2004. Following a very active year of drilling and acquisitions, our year end 2003 reserves remained balanced at 51 percent oil and 49 percent natural gas, compared with 49 percent oil and 51 percent natural gas at year end 2002. The increase in oil reserves is primarily attributable to the properties acquired in the North Sea. During 2003, the U.S. contributed 45 percent of equivalent production, up from 42 percent in 2002, reflecting the impact of the Gulf of Mexico assets acquired from BP and Shell. Apache ended the year in a strong financial position, maintaining single A credit ratings on unsecured long term debt issued by Moodys, Standard and Poors and Fitch rating agencies. Also, we reduced debt to 26 percent of capitalization despite over $3 billion in capital expenditures. To manage our financial flexibility, we consummated several debt and equity transactions during 2003: On January 22, 2003, in conjunction with the pending BP transaction, we completed a public offering of 19.8 million shares of common stock, adjusted for the two for one stock split, raising $554 million. During the second quarter, the Company issued $350 million of 12 year, senior unsecured notes at a 4.375 percent coupon rate. Proceeds were used to reduce bank debt and outstanding commercial paper, and for general corporate purposes. To take advantage of historically low interest rates on commercial paper and better position ourselves to pay down short term debt, if we so elect, on September 26, 2003, Apache repurchased and retired preferred interests issued by three of its subsidiaries for approximately $443 million, plus an additional $1 million for accrued dividends and distributions. The Company also filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows Apache to sell up to $1.5 billion in stock and debt securities. On September 12, 2003 the Company announced that its Board of Directors, in recognition of the Companys outstanding growth and progress, voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock 20 percent to 6 cents per share from 5 cents per share, effective with the November 2003 payment, and to split the stock two for one. While 2003 was an outstanding year, the current outlook for 2004 is also encouraging. Recent drilling successes and acquisitions should generate substantial production. Also, the current NYMEX futures markets indicate oil and natural gas prices above historical averages in 2004. Lastly, we are well positioned to access capital should appropriate acquisition opportunities present themselves. A more detailed discussion of operations follows our Critical Accounting Policies. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other 18 assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. See Results of Operations and Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management. Full Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Operations The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful efforts method, costs such as geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and delay rentals, are expensed as incurred where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method the net book value (full cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period. We have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments. Typically, the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting. The Company has taken note of a July 2003 inquiry to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regarding whether or not contract based oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contract ("mineral rights") should be recorded or disclosed as intangible assets. The inquiry presents a view that these mineral rights are intangible assets as defined in SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and, therefore, should be classified separately on the balance sheet as intangible assets. SFAS No. 141, and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became effective for transactions subsequent to June 30, 2001 with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 142 required as of January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets. Under the statement, intangible assets should be separately reported on the face of the balance sheet and accompanied by disclosure in the notes to financial statements. SFAS No. 142 scopes out accounting utilized by the oil and gas industry as prescribed by SFAS No. 19, and is silent about whether or not its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas companies. Apache does not believe that SFAS No. 141 or 142 change the classification of oil and gas mineral rights and the Company continues to classify these assets as part of oil and gas properties. The 19 Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) has added the treatment of oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda, which may result in a change in how Apache classifies these assets. Should such a change be required, the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after June 30, 2001 that would be classified as "intangible undeveloped mineral interest" was $78 million and $259 million as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after June 30, 2001 that would be classified as "intangible developed mineral interest" was $332 million and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Intangible developed mineral interest amounts are presented net of accumulated DD&A. Accumulated DD&A was estimated using historical depletion rates applied proportionately to the costs of the acquisitions to be classified as "intangible developed mineral interest". The amounts noted above only include mineral rights acquired in business combinations or major asset purchases, and exclude those acquired individually or in groups as we have not historically tracked these in this manner. The Company has also not historically tracked the amount of mineral rights in the proved property balances related to producing leases or relinquished leases. We are currently identifying a methodology to do so for transactions subsequent to June 30, 2001. The numbers above are based on our understanding of the issue before the EITF, if all mineral rights associated with unevaluated property and producing reserves were deemed to be intangible assets: mineral rights with proved reserves that were acquired after June 30, 2001 and mineral rights with no proved reserves would be classified as intangible assets and would not be included in oil and gas properties on our consolidated balance sheet; results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected because mineral rights would continue to be amortized in accordance with full cost accounting rules; and disclosures required by SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 relative to intangibles would be included in the notes to our financial statements. If the accounting for mineral rights is ultimately changed, transitional guidance for intangible assets permits the reclassification of only amounts acquired after the effective date of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 if records were not previously maintained to track acquisition costs based on their intangible or tangible nature. Lack of these records prior to the effective date could result in the loss of comparability between historical balances of tangible and intangible asset balances and among companies in the industry. Reserve Estimates Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a "ceiling" limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, their review covered 78, 68 and 61 percent of the reserve value, respectively. 20 Bad Debt Expense We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties of which we are the operator. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings. Generally, our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months. However, during 2001 and 2002, we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our oil and gas sales. Deteriorating economic conditions during 2001 and 2002 in Egypt lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in an additional one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. While hard currency shortages in Egypt could lead to further delays, we did not experience any further delays in 2003. Please refer to the Future Trends section in this Item 7 for additional discussion concerning our Egyptian receivables. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. Asset Retirement Obligation The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Prior to 2003, under the full cost method of accounting, as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections, the estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations, net of the value of salvage, were included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties. In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." Apache adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as discussed in Note 2 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. SFAS No. 143 significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets ("asset retirement obligations" or "ARO"). Primarily, the new statement requires the Company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the Companys asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations. SFAS No. 143 requires a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception. The Company, therefore, calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the ARO liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance. The sum of these cumulative expenses was compared to the depletion expense originally recorded. Because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under SFAS No. 143, the difference resulted in a gain which the Company recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. Upon implementation, the Company also had to determine if the statement required us to recalculate our historical full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K). The Company chose not to re calculate its historical full cost ceiling tests even though its historical oil and gas property balances would have been higher had we applied the statement from inception. We believe this approach is appropriate because SFAS No. 143 is silent on this issue and was not effective during the prior impairment test periods. Had a recalculation of the historical full cost ceiling test resulted in impairment, the charge would have reduced the gain recorded upon adoption. 21 Going forward, our depletion expense will be reduced since we will deplete a discounted ARO rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted. The lower depletion expense under SFAS No. 143 is offset, however, by accretion expense, which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time. Also, the Company had to determine how to incorporate the asset retirement obligations into the quarterly calculation of its full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K). SFAS No. 143 is silent with respect to this issue and, although there are various views, the Company elected to continue including the undiscounted ARO as part of future development costs, essentially reducing the present value of its future net revenues and full cost ceiling limit. To compare the property balance, which included the ARO component, to the full cost ceiling limit, which has been reduced by a similar abandonment cost, we netted the ARO liability against the property balance. The Company believes its view is appropriate since there must be a comparable basis between the net book value of the properties and the full cost ceiling limitation. Another widely contemplated view is to exclude the ARO from future development costs when calculating the full cost ceiling limitation and not reduce the carrying amount of capitalized costs by the related liability. This approach would result in a higher full cost ceiling limitation and a comparatively higher net oil and gas property balance. Income Taxes Oil and gas exploration and production is a global business. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). We intend to permanently reinvest earnings from our international operations; therefore, we do not recognize deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, we would then reflect taxes on those earnings. Derivatives Apache uses commodity derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and accounts for the contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133). The estimated fair values of Apaches derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. For contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. SFAS 133 requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be "marked to market" and reported in current period income, rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. The Company does not currently enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. The estimate of fair value of Apaches derivative contracts requires substantial judgment; however, the Companys derivative contracts are generally exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities that are traded in highly liquid markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data. Option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations. (see Commodity Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10 K for commodity price sensitivity information). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section includes a discussion of our 2003 and 2002 results of operations. Apache has six reportable segments, which are the United States, Canada, Australia, Egypt, the North Sea and Other International. 22 These segments are primarily in the business of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Please refer to Note 14 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for segment information. Acquisitions and Divestitures In 2003, we spent $1.6 billion on oil and gas acquisitions, adding 267 MMboe to our reserve base. The preponderance of our 2003 acquisition activity was focused in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The North Sea assets further diversified our reserves and production, while the Gulf of Mexico properties provide opportunities in an area that historically enjoys the highest netback natural gas pricing in North America. Seventy two percent of our acquisition capital was spent to acquire North Sea and Gulf of Mexico properties from BP. Another 13 percent was spent to acquire additional Gulf of Mexico properties from Shell. The balance of our activity involved smaller acquisitions in Australia and North America. The North Sea acquisition establishes a new international operating region for Apache, providing the potential for future internal growth. The Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from BP and Shell lay down well with our existing Gulf of Mexico properties and provide promising prospects for future exploration, exploitation and development activities. As we have in the past, we expect to identify and take advantage of efficiencies in field operations and economics of scale, while concurrently accelerating production and adding reserves. In association with the BP acquisition, Apache agreed to sell all of the production from the North Sea properties to BP for a two year period at a combination of fixed and market sensitive prices pursuant to a contract entered into in connection with the North Sea purchase agreement. To protect the acquisition economics on the Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from BP we hedged prices on a substantial portion of the oil production for a 12 month period ending January 31, 2004, and a substantial portion of the gas production for the first two years (see Note 4 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Prior to the Shell transaction, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (Morgan Stanley) paid Shell $300 million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in a portion of the reserves to be produced over the next four years. Shells sale of an overriding royalty interest to Morgan Stanley is commonly known in the industry as a volumetric production payment (VPP). Under the terms of the VPP, Morgan Stanley is to receive a fixed volume of oil and gas production over the four year term. The VPP reserves and production will not be recorded by Apache. In addition, a $60 million liability for the future cost to produce and deliver volumes subject to the VPP has been recorded by the Company because the overriding royalties are not burdened by production costs. This liability will be amortized as the volumes are produced and delivered to Morgan Stanley. In 2002, we elected to exercise patience on the acquisition front, in anticipation of lower acquisition prices. We focused our attention on managing our financial structure by building equity and paying down debt so we would be in a position to act quickly when attractive assets became available at reasonable prices. Our oil and gas acquisitions in 2002 totaled approximately $350 million, adding 49 MMboe to our reserve base, far short of the $880 million we expended during 2001, which added 213 MMboe of proved reserves. In addition, the acquisitions added $3 million and $146 million of production, processing and transportation facilities in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and $197 million of goodwill in 2001. Seventy five percent of our 2002 acquisition activity occurred in the U.S. and was related to the acquisition of properties primarily located in two Southern Louisiana parishes. The balance of our 2002 acquisitions primarily related to two acquisitions in Canada. In connection with our 2002 South Louisiana acquisition, we entered into costless collar hedges to protect Apache from the potential for falling gas prices and to protect the economics of the transaction. These hedges are consistent with some of our 2001 and 2000 acquisitions, whereby we entered into and assumed fixed price commodity swaps and costless collars that protected Apache from falling commodity prices. This enabled us to better predict the financial performance of our acquisitions. See Note 4 of Item 15 for the terms of the Companys hedging activity. 23 Our acquisitions over the last three years helped us maintain diversity in terms of hydrocarbon product (oil or gas), geologic risk and geographic location. As shown in Note 15 of this Form 10 K, our 2003 year end international reserves as a percentage of total reserves climbed to 30 percent from 22 percent at year end 2002, while our international average daily production remained constant at 36 percent of our total production in both 2003 and 2002. Our hydrocarbon product mix on a boe basis in 2003 remained relatively constant at 49 percent natural gas and 51 percent oil, compared to 51 percent natural gas and 49 percent oil in 2002. While the U.S., a highly stable environment, remains our largest producing core area, Apache will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in existing core areas and in new areas should they arise. Note that, in light of the uncertainty of how the collapse of Enron Corp. would impact the derivatives markets, we closed all of our derivatives positions in October and November 2001, most of which were associated with prior acquisitions, recognizing a net gain in 2001 of $10 million with additional gains and losses to be recognized over the original life of the hedge. A net gain of $24 million was recognized in 2002 and a $4 million net loss was recognized in 2003. These, as well as the unwinding of our gas price swaps associated with advances from gas purchasers, increased the Companys average natural gas price by $.02 per Mcf during 2003, $.04 per Mcf during 2002 and $.09 per Mcf during 2001. They increased our average crude oil price by $.03 per bbl during 2003, $.15 per bbl during 2002, and reduced our average crude oil price by $.42 per bbl during 2001. There is no material affect in future periods related to closed derivative positions. We routinely evaluate our property portfolio and divest those that are marginal or no longer fit into our strategic growth program. We divested $59 million, $7 million and $348 million of properties during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on the prices we receive for our production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while other economic factors could impact demand. Oil and Natural Gas Prices While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a world wide market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions. Apache sells its natural gas into three markets; 1) North America, which has a common market and where production is currently in short supply relative to demand. 2) Australia, which has a local market with limited demand and infrastructure. 3) Egypt, which has a local market and where the price received for the majority of our production is currently indexed to a weighted average Dated Brent crude oil price. For specific marketing arrangements by segment, please refer to Item 1, Business of this Form 10 K. Contributions to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues As with production and reserves, a consequence of geographic diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues and natural gas revenues. For the reasons discussed in the Oil and Natural Gas Price section above, contributions to oil revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately. 24 The following table presents each segments oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues, respectively. OIL REVENUES GAS REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 United States....................................... 33% 35% 40% 62% 51% 61% Canada.............................................. 13% 16% 17% 27% 29% 27% North America....................................... 46% 51% 57% 89% 80% 88% Egypt............................................... 23% 29% 27% 8% 15% 8% Australia........................................... 16% 20% 16% 3% 5% 4% North Sea........................................... 13% Other International................................. 2% Total........................................ 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% Crude Oil Contribution In 2003 oil revenues from areas outside the U.S. rose to approximately 67 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 65 percent in 2002. The increase is directly related to the acquisition of the North Sea properties and, to a much lesser extent, initial production from China. The percentage contribution from all other areas fell, reflecting the impact from the North Sea revenues and China revenues. In 2002, oil revenues outside the U.S. reached approximately 65 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 60 percent in 2001. This increase primarily occurred in Egypt and Australia where crude oil revenues rose to 29 percent and 20 percent of total oil revenues, respectively. Canada contributed 16 percent of oil revenue, down from 17 percent in 2001. Natural Gas Contribution The preponderance of consolidated natural gas revenues comes from our North American operations. In 2003, 89 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from North America, 62 percent from the U.S. and 27 percent from Canada. The U.S. contribution rose 11 percent from 2002, primarily because of the properties acquired from BP and Shell in 2003, and properties acquired in South Louisiana in December 2002. Our U.S. Gulf Coast region, which contributed 71 percent of Apaches U.S. 2003 production, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial production rates followed by steep declines when compared to most other U.S. producing areas. Higher U.S. natural gas prices also contributed, but to a much lesser extent. Canadas contribution was down two percent from 2002 primarily because of the production growth in the U.S. Egypts contribution to total gas revenues declined to eight percent from 15 percent in 2002. Egypts total natural gas revenues were relatively flat year over year, as additional revenues generated from higher natural gas prices were offset by lower production generated revenues. Australias contribution to 2003 natural gas revenues declined to three percent from five percent in 2002. In 2002, 80 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from the North American market, 51 percent from the U.S. and 29 percent from Canada. The remaining 20 percent was split between Egypt, 15 percent, and Australia, 5 percent. 25 The table below presents oil and gas production revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids.

Higher production added the remaining $230 million. Virtually all of the additional revenues attributable to price came from the U.S. and Canada. The additional revenues attributable to production were concentrated in the U.S., where natural gas production increased 32 percent, reflecting the impact from the 2003 BP and Shell acquisitions and the December 2002 acquisition of the South Louisiana properties. Partially offsetting the additional U.S. production revenues were lower production in Egypt, Australia and Canada, down seven percent, six percent and three percent, respectively. Egypts lower production related to gas production curtailment imposed by EGPC and scheduled plant shutdowns, while Australia saw lower customer demand. Consolidated natural gas revenues declined $391 million in 2002, consistent with an $.83 per Mcf decline in the weighted average realized price for natural gas and a four percent decline in production. The price decline reduced revenues by $342 million, while lower gas production reduced revenues by another $49 million. A gas production decline of 18 percent was experienced in the U.S., with declines of 21 percent and 13 percent in the Gulf Coast and Central regions, respectively. The Gulf Coast region, which contributed 61.5 percent of Apaches U.S. 2002 production, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial rates followed by steep declines when compared to other US producing regions. Natural decline coupled with capital curtailments, property sales in late 2001 and back to back hurricanes in September and October 2002 contributed to the production decline in the U.S. Collectively, Canada, Egypt, Australia and Argentina saw a 13 percent increase in natural gas production. Canadas increase was the result of previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity, coupled with successful results at Ladyfern, which offset natural decline at Zama. Egypts increase also came from previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. We have used long term, fixed price physical contracts to lock in a small portion of our domestic future natural gas production. The contracts provide a measure of protection to the Company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices and represented approximately nine and 11 percent of our 2003 and 2002 domestic natural gas production, respectively. In 2003, these contracts reduced our average realized price $.08 per Mcf. In 2002, these contracts added $.01 per Mcf. Additionally, substantially all of our natural gas production sold in Australia is subject to long term fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in Australias consumer price index. Our realized prices are also impacted by a change in the value of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. In 2003, we saw an increase in our realized prices primarily because of the stronger Australian dollar. Crude Oil Revenues Our 2003 consolidated oil revenues increased $698 million with a 34 percent increase in oil production generating an additional $531 million of revenues. Crude oil prices improved in all areas, pushing our worldwide weighted average crude oil price up $2.98 per barrel, adding the remaining $167 million. Revenues from properties acquired in the North Sea accounted for over half of the increase in oil revenues attributable to production. A portion of the revenue from the North Sea is tied to a separate crude oil physical sales contract entered into in conjunction with the acquisition. See Note 4 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the terms of this contract. Production in the U.S. increased 31 percent, primarily from the Gulf of Mexico BP properties and to a lesser extent from properties acquired from Shell and in South Louisiana in December 2002. Initial production from China and a nine percent increase in production from Egypt also contributed to the revenue gains. Oil revenues improved $137 million in 2002 with both a higher realized price and higher production. The weighted average realized price for oil improved $1.60 per barrel, adding $86 million to oil revenues, while oil production gains added another $51 million. The price improvement was across the board, while production gains of 29 percent and 12 percent occurred in Australia and Egypt, respectively. The Legendre, Simpson and Gibson/South Plato developments drove Australias gain, while Egypts increase was related to the Repsol acquisition in 2001 and subsequent drilling. U.S. production declined nine percent related to natural decline, 27 back to back hurricanes in late September and early October and property sales. See Note 3 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity. Operating Expenses The tables below present a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference either expenses on a boe basis or expenses on an absolute dollar basis, or both, depending on their relevance. During 2003, we saw tremendous growth in production and reserves accompanied by a corresponding rise in operating costs. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 (IN MILLIONS) (PER BOE) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment...... $1,003 $ 784 $ 760 $ 6.59 $ 6.29 $ 6.05 Other assets............................ 70 60 61 .46 .48 .48 Asset retirement obligation accretion..... 38 .25 International impairments................. 13 20 65 .08 .16 .52 Lease operating costs..................... 700 458 400 4.59 3.67 3.18 Gathering and transportation costs........ 60 38 35 .40 .31 .28 Severance and other taxes................. 122 67 75 .80 .54 .59 General and administrative expenses....... 138 105 89 .91 .84 .71 Financing costs, net...................... 115 113 118 .75 .91 .95 Total................................ $2,259 $1,645 $1,603 $14.83 $13.20 $12.76 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Apaches full cost DD&A expense is driven by many factors including certain costs incurred in the exploration, development, and acquisition of producing reserves, production levels, and estimates of proved reserve quantities and future developmental costs. 2003 full cost DD&A expense of $1 billion is comprised of the U.S., $489 million; Canada, $158 million; Egypt, $161 million; Australia, $110 million; the North Sea, $72 million; and China, $12 million. Full cost DD&A expense increased $220 million compared to 2002. The majority of the increase in absolute costs was in the U.S., up $119 million; and the North Sea, $72 million; related to increases in production driven by our recent acquisitions. First production in China added $12 million. The remaining increase is concentrated in Egypt and Australia. On a boe basis, our average full cost DD&A rate in 2003 increased $.30 to $6.59 from $6.29 in 2002. The bulk of the increase occurred in Australia, Egypt and the U.S. contributing $.12, $.09 and $.06, respectively. The increases in Australia and Egypt reflect the impact of higher finding and development costs, while the increase in the U.S. reflects the impact of higher finding and development costs and higher acquisition costs. China and the North Sea each added $.03, while Canadas rate lowered the consolidated rate $.03. In 2002, our full cost DD&A expense increased $24 million. Areas outside the U.S. saw an increase in their expense, while DD&A expense decreased in the U.S. The areas experiencing the largest increase in absolute costs were Egypt, up $29 million and Australia, up $24 million (consistent with their overall increase in production), while the U.S. experienced a $39 million decline in full cost DD&A expense on lower production levels. Canada also had higher DD&A expense of $7 million relating to higher production levels. On a boe basis our 2002 full cost DD&A rate rose $.24 to $6.29. The U.S. contributed $.13 to the increase in rate, driven by higher finding costs and higher future development costs. The remaining increase in the consolidated rate is split between Egypt and Australia. The impact from Egypt is related to higher finding and development costs. The impact from Australia is primarily related to higher future development costs. Depreciation of other assets increased $10 million, in 2003 in line with our overall growth. 28 Impairments We assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of acreage. When an impairment occurs, costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. In some of our international exploration plays, however, we have not yet established proved reserves. As such, any impairments in these areas are immediately charged to earnings. During 2001, we impaired a portion of our unproved property costs in Poland and China by $65 million ($41 million after tax). In 2002, we impaired an additional $20 million in Poland ($12 million after tax). In 2003, we impaired the remaining $13 million ($8 million after tax) of unproved property costs in Poland. Goodwill is subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment beginning in 2002. Goodwill totals $189 million at December 31, 2003 and no impairment was recorded in 2003 or 2002. For further discussion, see Note 1 of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Lease Operating Costs Lease operating costs (LOE) is generally comprised of several components; direct operating costs, repair and maintenance costs, workover costs and ad valorem costs. LOE is driven in part by the type of commodity produced, the level of workover activity and the geographical location of the properties. Oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy. They enable us to exploit our existing reserves by accelerating production and taking advantage of high priced environments. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with plants and facilities. During 2003, the Company saw a substantial increase in its LOE costs on both an absolute dollar basis and boe basis. The majority of the increase on an absolute dollar basis was expected, given the BP and Shell acquisitions and the acquisition of the South Louisiana properties. On a boe basis, 2003 LOE increased $.92 to $4.59, with all of the increase occurring outside the U.S. The North Sea properties, which are located offshore and produce oil, added approximately $109 million of costs, increasing our consolidated rate $.46 per boe. Canadas LOE costs increased $44 million, adding $.30 to our consolidated boe rate. The impact from a weaker U.S. dollar, a full year of LOE on properties acquired in the second half of 2002, costs associated with new fields, and higher power and fuel rates drove the increase in Canadian costs. Egypts operating costs increased $13 million, adding $.09 to the overall rate. The majority of the increase in Egypt was attributable to higher workover activity. Australias LOE increased $7 million because of an increase in repair and maintenance and higher oil production. Australia added $.10 to the overall boe rate. The LOE rate in the U.S. declined as the impact from the additional costs associated with the acquisitions discussed above were more than offset by the incremental production. The U.S. reduced the overall rate by $.05 per boe. During 2002, LOE was $3.67 per boe, a $.49 increase from 2001. Higher absolute costs accounted for 94 percent, $.46 per boe, of this rate increase, with lower production accounting for the remaining $.03 per boe. We experienced higher absolute costs in the Gulf Coast region, Egypt and Canada. In the Gulf Coast region increased repairs and maintenance, related to both routine operations and hurricane repairs, generally higher costs on properties operated by others on offshore Gulf of Mexico properties and increased workover activity in the region, contributed to higher LOE. In Egypt, higher workover activity on the Khalda, South Umbarka and East Bahariya concessions drove up LOE. In Canada, the increased costs reflect the impact of the Fletcher, Conoco and Burlington acquisitions, which carry higher production costs than our other operations, and increased workover activity, with the heaviest activity at House Mountain, Hatton, Zama and Simonette fields. Gathering and Transportation Costs During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." Prior to adoption, amounts paid to third parties for transportation had been reported as a reduction of revenue instead of an increase in operating expenses. Recent property acquisitions and their associated transportation arrangements have increased the significance of transportation costs paid to 29 third parties. For comparative purposes, previously reported transportation costs paid to third parties were reclassified as corresponding increases to oil and gas production revenues and operating expenses with no impact on income attributable to common stock. Apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two types of transactions, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which Apache sells oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collects a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. Under the other arrangement, Apache sells oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pays transportation to a carrier and receives from the purchaser a price with no transportation deduction. In both the U.S. and Canada, Apache sells oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, Apache pays transportation to a carrier and receives a purchase price with no transportation deduction. In Egypt and Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under the netback arrangement. Gathering and transportation costs disclosed here only include transportation paid by Apache to a carrier. These costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our North American operations. In 2003, these costs totaled $28 million in Canada and $21 million in the U.S., up from $21 million and $17 million in 2002, respectively. The increase in Canada primarily involved higher third party transportation charges for gas transported from several fields and increased production volumes from 2002 acquisitions. Canada also incurred transportation charges for crude oil as we began taking our oil "in kind" and marketing it ourselves instead of selling it at the lease. The increase in the U.S. is related to the higher production from the Gulf of Mexico acquisitions. In the North Sea, these costs are related to the transportation of crude oil and totaled $11 million in 2003. Overall, transportation costs in 2002 were relatively flat to 2001. Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes are comprised primarily of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia. In both 2003 and 2002, these severance taxes, which are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, represented over 60 percent of the total severance and other taxes expense incurred. The other tax component is primarily made up of the Australian Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), to which Apache first became subject in 2002, the Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) on the North Sea properties and the Canadian Large Corporation Tax, Saskatchewan Capital Tax, Saskatchewan Resource Surtax and Freehold Mineral Tax. Oil and gas production revenues generated from Egypt, Canada and the North Sea are not subject to severance taxes. In 2003, severance and other taxes totaled $122 million ($53 million in the U.S., $28 million in Australia, $20 million in the North Sea, $20 million in Canada and $1 million in Argentina). Severance and other taxes increased 81 percent or $54 million. Twenty million dollars of the increase is associated with North Seas PRT expense. Canadian taxes increased $10 million as a result of exchange rate increases and higher prices in 2003, and a $2 million refund in 2002. U.S. and Australia severance taxes increased $17 million and $7 million, respectively, in line with higher production revenues. In 2002, severance and other taxes totaled $67 million, comprised of U.S., $35 million, Australia, $23 million and Canada, $9 million. Overall, severance and other taxes decreased $7 million. A $14 million decline in U.S. severance taxes, and a $3 million decline in Canada Saskatchewan Resource Surtax were partially offset by initial PRRT of $4 million and a $7 million increase in Australian severance taxes. The decrease in U.S. severance taxes reflects the impact of lower gas price realizations. The increase in Australias severance taxes was attributable to higher oil price realizations and a change in production mix as a higher portion of production was from properties in provincial waters, such as Legendre and Harriet, relative to production from federal waters. Canadas decline was primarily related to a refund of the Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses (G&A) of $.91 per boe for 2003 increased $.07 per boe over 2002. Absolute costs increased $34 million, or 32 percent. Over $11 million, or 34 percent, is associated with expensing compensation, including Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), stock options, restricted stock and 30 incremental incentive compensation, in light of our record year. The increased stock compensation expense stems from Apaches decision to expense stock related compensation plans (see Note 9 in Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Approximately $9 million, or 28 percent, of the increase is related to our new North Sea operations. The balance of the increase was related to the Companys decision to increase its charitable contributions, expansion of the Companys new gas marketing group and transition costs incurred on acquisitions. Overall, general and administrative expenses trended higher in 2002, rising $.13 to $.84 per boe. On an absolute cost basis, thirty eight percent of the increase is tied to rising medical costs, a sharp increase in premiums on business insurance policies renewed subsequent to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the addition of a sizeable political risk insurance package added in mid 2001. The remaining increase is related to non recurring employee separation costs, a consequence of our region realignment in the U.S., higher outside legal support costs related to arbitration proceedings with our gas marketer, Cinergy and litigation with Predator (see Note 11 of this Form 10 K), costs associated with the implementation of and compliance with various sections of Sarbanes Oxley, and a full year of expense related to additional staff and office costs incurred with the acquisition of Canadian subsidiaries of Fletcher during 2001. Realignment of our three U.S. regions into two involved both reassignment and reduction of personnel. All corresponding costs were expensed as incurred. Financing Costs, Net The major components of net financing costs are interest expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs increased $2 million compared to 2002 with a $13 million increase in expense largely offset by an increase in capitalized interest. Five million dollars of the increase is interest expense related to the write off of unamortized fees triggered by the retirement of preferred interests of subsidiaries discussed below. The remaining $8 million of higher interest expense was attributable to a higher average debt balance in 2003 compared to 2002. Capitalized interest increased $12 million driven by a higher unproved property balance associated with acquisitions and an active drilling program. If net financing costs included distributions from Preferred Interests of Subsidiaries, net financing costs would have decreased by approximately $5 million. Net financing costs decreased by five percent in 2002. Lower average debt outstanding during 2002 resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $23 million compared to 2001. A reduction in capitalized interest of $16 million, associated with lower unproved property balances, partially offset this decrease. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2003 was 6.4 percent compared to 6.3 percent on December 31, 2002. The rate is higher at year end 2003 as a lower percentage of our debt is at floating rates, which carry a lower rate than fixed rate debt. Provision for Income Taxes 2003 income tax expense of $827 million was $482 million or 140 percent higher than the 2002. The higher taxes were primarily associated with higher income in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate increased primarily because of $172 million of additional deferred tax expenses resulting from currency fluctuations. For a discussion of Apaches sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations, please refer to "Foreign Currency Risk" under Item 7A of this Form 10 K. The impact caused by currency fluctuations was partially offset by a $71 million reduction in deferred tax expense related to a reduction in Canadian federal statutory income tax rates. Our effective tax rate for 2003 was 43.02 percent compared to 38.34 percent for the prior year. Our 2002 effective tax rate was slightly lower than 2001. 31 OIL AND GAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 (IN THOUSANDS) Exploration and Development: United States............................................ $ 439,541 $302,611 $ 699,180 Canada................................................... 579,495 258,191 410,345 Egypt.................................................... 242,652 171,160 127,603 Australia................................................ 128,261 89,813 85,169 North Sea................................................ 60,204 Other International...................................... 35,098 38,409 20,838 $1,485,251 $860,184 $1,343,135 Capitalized Interest....................................... $ 52,891 $ 40,691 $ 56,749 Gas Gathering Transmission and Processing Facilities....... $ 38,533 $ 32,155 $ 28,759 Acquisitions: Oil and gas properties................................... $1,568,106 $351,707 $ 880,286 Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities.... 5,484 2,875 146,295 Goodwill................................................. 197,200 $1,573,590 $354,582 $1,223,781 In 2003, Apache added 503.2 MMboe of proved reserves through acquisitions, drilling and revisions, replacing 330 percent of production. In 2002, Apache added 172.1 MMboe of proved reserves through acquisitions, drilling and revisions, replacing 138 percent of production. The preliminary capital expenditure budget for 2004 is approximately $1.8 billion (excluding acquisitions), including $1 billion for North America. Preliminary North American capital expenditures include $400 million in the Gulf Coast region, $100 million in the Central region and $500 million in Canada. The Company has estimated its international capital expenditures in 2004 at $800 million. Capital expenditures will be reviewed periodically, and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions. CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS Apache paid a total of $6 million in dividends during 2003 on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock were paid through May 15, 2002, when the shares automatically converted to common stock (see Note 9, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Common dividends paid during 2003 rose 19 percent to $67 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 39 consecutive years through 2003. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 20 percent, to six cents per share from five cents per share, effective with the November 2003 dividend payment. CAPITAL RESOURCES Apaches primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flows. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices, drilling and acquisition costs, and cash flow. The Company has 32 historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities, debt, preferred interests of subsidiaries and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all other cash needs. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2003 totaled $2.7 billion, an increase of 96 percent from 2002 driven by higher oil and gas production revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses. Oil production revenues increased with a 34 percent increase in production and a 12 percent increase in prices. Gas production revenues increased with a 13 percent production increase and a 61 percent price increase. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 decreased 28 percent to $1.4 billion from $1.9 billion in 2001. The decrease was driven by lower oil and gas production revenues and slightly higher operating expenses. Oil and gas production revenues fell with a 22 percent decline in gas prices, which was partially offset by a seven percent improvement in oil prices. The impact of lower gas production was partially offset by rising oil production. Debt At December 31, 2003, Apache had outstanding debt of $135 million under its commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit and a total of $2.2 billion of other debt. This other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years 2005 through 2096. Based on our current plan for capital spending and projections of debt and interest rates, interest payments on the Companys debt for 2004 are projected to be $160 million (using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations). On June 3, 2002, Apache entered into a new $1.5 billion global credit facility to replace its existing global and 364 day credit facilities. The new global credit facility consists of four separate bank facilities: a $750 million 364 day facility in the United States; a $450 million five year facility in the United States; a $150 million five year facility in Australia; and a $150 million five year facility in Canada. Loans under the global credit facility do not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The five year facilities are scheduled to mature on June 3, 2007 and the 364 day facility is currently scheduled to mature on May 28, 2004. The 364 day facility allows the Company the option to convert outstanding revolving loans at maturity into one year term loans. The Company may request extensions of the maturity dates subject to approval of the lenders. Please see Note 6 "Debt" of Item 15 for a summary of the financial covenants of the global credit facility. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets (with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens), restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee the debt of entities not within our consolidated group. The Company has a $1.2 billion commercial paper program which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper balances at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such amounts on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under the U.S. five year facility and the 364 day facility. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. five year credit facility and 364 day credit facility are available as a 100 percent backstop. The weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was 1.19 percent in 2003 and 1.85 percent in 2002. Preferred Interests of Subsidiaries During 2001, several of our subsidiaries issued a total of $443 million ($441 million, net of issuance costs) of preferred stock and limited partner interests to unrelated institutional investors, adding to the Companys financial liquidity. We paid a weighted average return to the investors of 123 basis points above the prevailing LIBOR interest rate. These subsidiaries were consolidated in the accompanying financial 33 statements with the $437 million at December 31, 2002 reflected as preferred interests of subsidiaries on the balance sheet. On September 26, 2003, Apache repurchased and retired the preferred interests issued by three of its subsidiaries for approximately $443 million, plus an additional $1 million for accrued dividends and distributions. The transactions involved the purchase of preferred stock issued by two of the Companys subsidiaries for approximately $82 million and the retirement of a limited partnership interest in a partnership controlled by a subsidiary of the Company for approximately $361 million. Apache funded the transactions with available cash on hand and by issuing commercial paper under its existing commercial paper facility. Stock Transactions On September 13, 2001, our Board of Directors declared a 10 percent stock dividend payable on January 21, 2002 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2001. As a result, we reclassified approximately $545 million from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital, which represents the fair market value at the date of declaration of the shares distributed. No fractional shares were issued and cash payments totaling $891,000 were made in lieu of fractional shares. On May 15, 2002, we completed the mandatory conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock into approximately 13.1 million common shares. On December 18, 2002, our Board of Directors declared a five percent stock dividend payable on April 2, 2003 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. As a result, in December 2002, we reclassified approximately $396 million from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital, which represents the fair market value at the date of declaration of the shares distributed. In 2003, at the date of the distribution, an additional $26 million was reclassified from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital. No fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares. On January 22, 2003, we completed a public offering of approximately 19.8 million shares of common stock, including 2.6 million shares for the underwriters over allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million. On December 18, 2003, we announced that holders of our common stock approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to 430 million from 215 million in order to complete a previously announced two for one stock split. The record date for the stock split was December 31, 2003 and the additional shares were distributed on January 14, 2004. LIQUIDITY During 2003, we strengthened our financial flexibility and continued to build upon the solid financial performances of previous years. Cash will be required to fund expenditures necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves typical in an extractive industry like ours. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and our success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. We believe that cash on hand, net cash generated from operating activities, and unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy future financial obligations and liquidity needs. Net cash generated from operating activities is a function of commodity prices, which are inherently volatile and unpredictable, production and capital spending. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will shrink, as stated in Item 1, "Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations". Based on the year end reserve life index, the Companys overall decline is approximately nine percent per year. This projection assumes the capital investment, prices, costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in Item 15 Note 15, of this Form 10 K. Less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and, therefore, capital budgets. 34 For these reasons, we only forecast, for internal use by management, an annual cash flow. These annual forecasts are revised monthly and capital budgets are reviewed by management and adjusted as warranted by market conditions. Longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are neither developed nor used by management to operate our business. As of December 31, 2003, available borrowing capacity under our global credit facility was $1.4 billion. We had $34 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2003, a decrease from $52 million at the prior year end. In addition, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased from 1.44 at the end of last year to 1.10 at December 31, 2003. We have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Please see the indicated Note to the Companys consolidated financial statements, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations.

Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003, the Company recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation. See Note 2, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. (b) This table does not include the Companys pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 11 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations. The Company has reserved approximately $10 million for environmental remediation. The Companys exposure to other legal contingent liabilities is estimated at less than $8 million and is fully reserved. The Company does not believe it has any material exposure for any contingencies (see Note 11 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K). Upon closing of our acquisition of the North Sea properties, Apache will assume BPs abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, does not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache does not satisfy the abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to ensure Apaches payment of these costs, Apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moodys and 35 Standard and Poors from the Companys current ratings of A3 and A , respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change. If Apache is obligated to provide a letter of credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level. The initial letter of credit amount would be 175 million British pounds ($306 million U.S. at December 31, 2003). This amount represents the letter of credit requirement through March 2004, and will be negotiated annually based on Apaches future abandonment obligation estimates. In addition, under Apaches long term oil physical sales contract with BP, related to the BP acquisition, Apache may be required to post margin if the mark to market exposure, as defined, exceeds the credit threshold limits. The outstanding position of the term oil physical sales contract with BP is described in greater detail in Note 4 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K. The Companys future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys; however, we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely. The Companys global credit facility does not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail within the debt section of our discussion on Capital Resources above. In addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements, Apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the Companys credit ratings decline significantly. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose. Any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements would be scrutinized and disclosed by the Companys management. FUTURE TRENDS Apaches strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves: exploiting our existing asset base; acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value; and investing in high potential exploration prospects. Apaches present plans are to increase 2004 worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling to approximately $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion in 2003. We will continue to monitor commodity prices and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly. We will also continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities. Exploiting Existing Asset Base Apache seeks to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while containing operating costs per unit. In order to achieve these objectives, we rigorously pursue production enhancement opportunities such as workovers, recompletions and moderate risk drilling, while divesting marginal and non strategic properties and identifying other activities to reduce costs. Our 2003 acquisitions from BP and Shell added to our inventory at a time of high commodity prices. Acquiring Properties to Which We Can Add Incremental Value Apache seeks to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers. Our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, facilitating asset growth and debt reduction. We evaluate potential purchases on an ongoing basis, but we are very selective. Practically all of our 2003 acquisition activity was completed by early July. We remained in the market during the second half of 2003, but we did 36 not identify any assets that fit our balanced portfolio business model. We believe attractive assets will be available, as larger energy companies look to shed non core assets. Investing in High Potential Exploration Prospects Apache seeks to concentrate its exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions. We believe that these investments, although generally higher risk, offer potential for attractive investment returns and significant reserve additions. Our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy. They complement our North American operations, which are more development oriented. A critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility. All three rating agencies have "A credit ratings" on Apaches senior unsecured long term debt, a testament to our conservative financial structure and commitment to preserving a strong balance sheet while building a solid foundation and competitive advantage with which to pursue our growth initiatives. Egyptian Receivables Deteriorating economic conditions during 2001 and 2002 in Egypt lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in an additional one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. While hard currency shortages in Egypt could lead to further delays, we did not experience any further delays in 2003. It is currently our intention to resolve the delays in EGPCs payments prior to incurring the substantial capital expenditures required to develop our deepwater interests in the West Mediterranean Concession or signing the gas sales agreement provided for by the MOU for a minimum of 2.7 Tcf of natural gas over 25 years from such concession. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY RISK The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of $25.53 per barrel to a high of $31.66 per barrel during 2003. Average gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of $4.11 per Mcf to a monthly high of $6.66 per Mcf during the same period. Based on the Companys 2003 worldwide oil production levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by $75 million. Based on the Companys 2003 worldwide gas production levels, a $.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by $44 million. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes, do not exceed the "ceiling." This ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to additional DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities; however, as discussed above, sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures 37 contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As indicated in Notes 3 and 4, under Item 15 of this Form 10 K, the Company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with the South Louisiana acquisition in December 2002 and with the acquisition from BP in 2003. These positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices and were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated production. On December 31, 2003, the Company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of $(60) million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would change the fair value by $(32) million. A 10 percent decrease in prices would change the fair value by $31 million. The Company also had open oil price swap positions with a fair value of $(9) million. A 10 percent change in oil prices would change the fair value by plus or minus $5 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2003. See Note 4 under Item 15 of this Form 10 K for notional volumes associated with the Companys derivative contracts. INTEREST RATE RISK Approximately 94 percent of the Companys yearend 2003 debt is term debt with fixed interest rates, minimizing the Companys exposure to fluctuations in short term interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the Company had $135 million of floating rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in the floating interest rate (approximately 11 basis points) on these year end balances, would change annual interest expense $148,000. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2003 or 2002. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, however, the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars and British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date. Prior to October 1, 2002, reported cash flow from Canadian operations was measured in Canadian dollars and converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported. The majority of Apaches debt in Canada is denominated in U.S. dollars and, as such, was adjusted for differences in exchange rates at each period end and recorded as Revenues and Other. In light of the continuing transformation of the U.S. and Canadian energy markets into a single energy market, we adopted the U.S. dollar as our functional currency in Canada, effective October 1, 2002. A 10 percent strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the British pound as of December 31, 2003 will result in a foreign currency net loss of approximately $66 million. This is primarily driven from foreign currency effects on the Companies deferred tax liability positions in its international operations. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2003 or 2002. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. 38 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices, may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
