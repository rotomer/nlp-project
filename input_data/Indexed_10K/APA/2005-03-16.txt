ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Apache Corporation is an independent energy company whose principle business includes exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Company operates in five core countries which, collectively, contained over 99 percent of the Companys 2004 year end estimated proved reserves and accounted for over 98 percent of the Companys 2004 oil and gas production revenues. These principle operations are located in the United States, Canada, Egypt, Australia and offshore the United 17 Kingdom in the North Sea. The Companys smaller non core operations are conducted offshore China and in Argentina. Apache adheres to a portfolio approach to provide diversity in terms of hydrocarbon mix (crude oil and natural gas), reserve life, geologic risk and geographic location. Our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through drilling, acquisitions, or a combination of both, depending on, among other things, cost levels and availability of acquisition opportunities. As we pursue growth, we continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet our future financial obligations and liquidity needs. These obligations and needs are met with cash on hand, cash generated from our operations, unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility, and the capital markets. The interest cost of debt and access to the equity markets are greatly influenced by the Companys ability to maintain both a strong balance sheet and generate ongoing operating cash flow. For these reasons, we strive to maintain a manageable debt load that is properly balanced with equity, and our single A credit ratings. We are also cognizant of the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves. Consequently, we closely monitor trends by operating area in drilling costs and the price at which properties are available for purchase, so that we may adjust our budgets accordingly and allocate funds to projects based on potential rate of return. We review operating costs monthly by operating area, on both an absolute dollar and per unit of production basis. We then compare these results to our historical norms after factoring in the impact from property acquisitions and changes in industry conditions in order to actively manage individual cost elements as appropriate. Given the inherent volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices and changing industry conditions, we frequently revise our forecasts and adjust our budgets accordingly. We entered 2004 with historically strong commodity prices which strengthened further during the year. Average realized prices for crude oil and natural gas increased 27 and seven percent, respectively, over 2003; a reflection of higher worldwide commodity prices. In addition, oil and natural gas production increased 13 and one percent, respectively, a result of acquisitions and successful exploration and development drilling programs. Increased production combined with high commodity prices drove the Companys attainment of several operational and financial milestones as noted below. Our 2004 oil and gas production revenues totaled $5.3 billion, $1.1 billion higher than in 2003. We generated earnings of $1.7 billion, 49 percent above our prior year level. On a diluted share basis earnings rose $1.60 to $5.03 per diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 19 percent from the prior year to $3.2 billion. Production increased for 25 of the last 26 years. 2004 year end estimated proved reserves grew 17 percent from 2003 to 1.94 billion barrels of oil equivalent, marking the 19th consecutive year of reserve growth. Exploration, development and acquisition expenditures totaled $3.4 billion in 2004. Apache ended the year with debt at 24 percent of capitalization, down 2% from year end 2003. Fitch upgraded Apaches senior unsecured long term debt rating from A to A and Moodys and Standard and Poors continue to rate Apaches unsecured long term debt A3 and A , respectively. The Company increased its common stock dividend from an annual rate of 24 cents per share to 32 cents per share. The Company spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions in 2004, down $500 million from 2003, as acquisition expenditures typically vary from year to year based on the availability of opportunities that fit Apaches overall strategy. On the exploration and development front, Apache spent $2.3 billion, 61 percent more than last year, drilling a record number of wells. Significant highlights resulting from the Companys acquisition, exploration and development programs in each of our core areas follow. 18 U.S.: Apache entered into two separate Agreements with Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) in the U.S. In West Texas and New Mexico we acquired properties in 23 mature producing oil and gas fields for $318 million and separately entered into a partnership to obtain additional interests in the properties. Additionally, we entered into joint exploration agreements to explore Apaches acreage in South Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf. For additional details regarding these agreements refer to the Acquisitions and Divestitures section of this Item 7. Apache purchased interests in 74 fields covering 232 blocks and 104 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) for $532 million. The properties were subject to a pre existing overriding royalty interest owned by Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (Morgan Stanley). For additional details regarding this transaction refer to the Acquisitions and Divestitures section of this Item 7. The Company spent $755 million to drill over 400 wells on continued exploitation of its U.S. properties, including those purchased from BP p.l.c. (BP) and Shell Exploration and Production Company (Shell) in 2003 and the 2004 acquisitions noted above. The U.S. accounted for 41 percent of our 2004 equivalent production and 44 percent of the Companys estimated proved reserves at year end 2004. CANADA: The Company entered in to a farm in agreement with ExxonMobil covering approximately 380,000 gross acres of undeveloped properties in the Western Canadian Province of Alberta, increasing our gross acreage to 6.5 million acres of prospective properties in Canada. By drilling at least 250 wells over a two year period, which began in October 2004, Apache will receive a one year extension in which to earn additional sections. Apache drilled 50 wells on this acreage in the fourth quarter of 2004. For additional details regarding this transaction refer to the Acquisitions and Divestitures section of this Item 7. The Company emerged as the largest producer of coalbed methane in Canada with its drilling activities in the Nevis area. The North and South Grant Lands in the ExxonMobil farmout provide additional coalbed methane potential. Apache spent $757 million on exploration and development in Canada, completing 1,211 of 1,313 wells for a success rate of 92 percent. Canada accounted for approximately 18 percent of our equivalent production in 2004 and 25 percent of the Companys estimated proved reserves at year end 2004. EGYPT: We continued to evaluate and develop the Qasr field, a July 2003 discovery, drilling several successful appraisal wells and one development well, and commencing commercial production on a limited basis in September 2004. The appraisal wells confirmed the overall seismically defined structure of the field and our original estimated range of ultimately recoverable reserves. Following further development of the field and construction of pipeline facilities, we currently expect gross gas production of approximately 75 MMcf/d by third quarter 2005, ramping up to approximately 150 MMcf/d and 5,000 barrels of condensate per day around year end 2005. The Qasr production will be sold under the terms of a 25 year Gas Sales Agreement, signed April 22, 2004, with the Egyptian General Petroleum Company (EGPC) covering up to 2.1 Tcf of natural gas from the Qasr field. Principle terms include supplying up to 300 MMcf/d to the Egyptian market. The pricing terms under the agreement are indexed to crude oil and include a minimum price of $1.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and a maximum price of $2.65 per MMBtu. The Btu factor for our Egyptian gas generally ranges between 1,100 and 1,300 Btu per Mcf. On May 20, 2004, we announced the Sheiba 18 3 discovery. It is the first commercial oil discovery in the eastern part of the Shell operated North East Abu Gharadig Concession in Egypts Western Desert. We are continuing to evaluate and explore this area. 19 On June 23, 2004, we announced the Ozoris 4 well which identified new field pays in the Khalda Concession. The discovery of stratigraphically trapped gas condensate in Upper Safa sands in the Ozoris 4 opens up a large new play in the Shushan Basin, north of the Qasr high and west of the Khalda Ridge fields. On August 19, 2004, we announced two gas discoveries, the Imhoptep 1X on the Khalda Offset Concession and the Mihos 1X well on the Matruh Concession, that began flowing into the Tarek gas plant allowing it to operate at full capacity of 100 MMcf/d. AUSTRALIA: On January 6, 2004, we announced that the Thomas Bright 2 appraisal well in the John Brookes field of the Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia extended the boundary of the reservoir, thus increasing estimated gross recoverable reserves. All of the 628 Bcf of estimated proved reserves at John Brookes are dedicated to existing long term contracts (also see Item 1 and 2, Business and Properties, "Operating Highlights Australia" in this Form 10 K for additional information on Apaches gas contracts in Australia). We expect to complete facility installation in mid 2005, with initial production commencing during the third quarter 2005. On May 19, 2004, we announced the Stickle 1 well, our third wildcat discovery in the Exmouth Sub Basin of the Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia. On July 13, 2004, we announced that our Ravensworth 2 appraisal well in the Exmouth Sub Basin encountered an oil column 49 feet higher than we expected, extending the area of the field considerably farther north than we had mapped based on the July 2003 Ravensworth 1 well. Appraisal wells along with additional exploration drilling is currently scheduled for 2005. NORTH SEA: Our focus in the North Sea was two pronged: invest capital to improve field operating efficiency and undertake an active drilling program. During 2004, we drilled 12 successful wells and invested over $150 million in capital expenditures to improve operating efficiency, boosting fourth quarter 2004 production to an average of 61,680 b/d, over 50 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2003. Our year end 2004 estimated reserves were balanced, with a 48 percent oil and 52 percent natural gas mix. This compares to 51 percent oil and 49 percent natural gas at the end of 2003. Estimated proved undeveloped reserves represented 32.7 percent of total estimated proved reserves for year end 2004 compared to 28.5 percent at year end 2003. The increase is primarily attributed to appraisal drilling in the Qasr field, expansion of our infill shallow gas drilling programs in Canada, new gas contracts in Australia and a high percentage of undeveloped reserves in the Anadarko acquisition. Apache was challenged in 2004 by steadily increasing service and acquisition costs resulting from increased demand with high commodity prices. Service costs impacting both drilling and lease operating costs have grown significantly over the past year; including rig rates, drill pipe costs, chemical costs and the costs of power and fuel. The Company reviews these costs for each core area on a routine basis and pursues alternatives in maintaining efficient levels of costs and expenses. While we are encouraged by the current outlook for 2005, we will continue to monitor costs and unless drilling costs level out, we may act to reduce our drilling expenditures, as we did in 2001. This is especially true in the U.S. where reserve targets continue to decrease in size. Acquisition costs also increased, however Apache has developed approaches to complete prudent asset acquisitions even when prices are high by routinely hedging production from newly acquired assets in order to protect acquisition economics in the critical early years. We believe we are well positioned to pursue future acquisitions should the appropriate opportunities arise. The Company also experienced unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements in Canada, Australia and the U.K. in 2004 which impacted our lease operating and drilling costs. Refer to the "Costs" section of this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further discussion of items impacting costs in 2004. 20 In July 2004, the Company signed an amendment agreement with the EGPC which, among other things, extended the term of the Khalda, Khalda West and Salam development leases through 2024. These development leases would have expired in 2011, 2012 and 2010, respectively. We also received a five year extension on our Khalda Offset exploration acreage, with an option for an additional three year extension. As part of this agreement and in conjunction with the Qasr 25 year Gas Sales Agreement discussed above, we agreed to re price natural gas volumes in excess of 100 MMcf/d produced from the Khalda Concession development leases and future Khalda Offset development leases. Under the new pricing formula, Apache will receive a price indexed to crude oil, with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu. Pricing for the first 100 MMcf/d remains subject to the original contract price, which is indexed to oil pricing, but without a minimum or maximum. The pricing for this first 100 MMcf/d continues until January 1, 2013, at which time all Khalda area gas will be priced at the new pricing formula. For 2004, Apaches price averaged $4.35 per Mcf, which was a blend of the old and new contracts. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, Apaches share price exceeded the first threshold ($43.29) under its 2000 Share Appreciation Plan on April 28, 2004. As such, the Company will issue to substantially all employees approximately 900,000 shares of its common stock, after minimum tax withholding requirements, in three annual installments. The first installment was issued in May 2004. The second and third installments will be issued in 2005 and 2006 to employees remaining with the Company during those periods. Also, on October 26, 2004, Apaches share price exceeded the second threshold ($51.95) of the Companys 2000 Share Appreciation Plan. Accordingly, Apache will issue approximately 2.2 million additional shares of its common stock, after minimum tax withholding requirements, in three equal installments. The first installment was issued in November 2004. The second and third installments will be issued in 2005 and 2006 to employees remaining with the Company during those periods. In February, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors voted to present to the stockholders of the Company for approval a new plan that provides incentives for employees to double the share price again, to $108, by the end of 2008, with an interim goal to be achieved by the end of 2007. If the goals are achieved, the shareholder value of the Company will grow by an additional $18 billion. On January 14, 2004, we completed the two for one common stock split approved by our board of directors in September 2003. Separately, on January 26, 2004, the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. approved Apache for trading on the NASDAQ National Market (NASDAQ), an intention we first announced on January 12, 2004. Our common stock is now listed on the NASDAQ as well as the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Stock Exchange. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section includes a discussion of our 2004 and 2003 results of operations and provides insight into unique events and circumstances for each of the Companys six reportable segments. Apaches geographic segments include the United States, Canada, Egypt, Australia, the North Sea and Other International. These segments are primarily in the business of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Please refer to Note 13, Business Segment Information of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for segment information. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES ExxonMobil During the third quarter of 2004, Apache entered into separate arrangements with ExxonMobil that provided for property transfers and joint operating and exploration activity across a broad range of prospective and mature properties in (1) Western Canada, (2) West Texas and New Mexico, and (3) onshore Louisiana and on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf. Apaches participation included cash payments of approximately $347 million, subject to normal post closing adjustments. The following summarizes these transactions: ExxonMobil Western Canada In August 2004, Apache signed a farm in agreement with ExxonMobil covering approximately 380,000 gross acres of undeveloped properties in the Western Canadian Province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache has the right to earn acreage sections by drilling an initial 21 well on each such section. By drilling at least 250 wells during the initial two year earning period under the agreement, Apache will receive a one year extension in which to earn additional sections. As to any sections earned by Apache, ExxonMobil will retain a 37.5 percent royalty on fee lands and 35 percent of its working interest on leasehold acreage. Under certain circumstances, ExxonMobil has the right to convert its retained 35 percent working interest into a 12.5 percent overriding royalty. In addition, during the terms of this agreement, Apache is required to carry ExxonMobils retained working interest with respect to certain drilling, capping, completion, equipping and tie in costs associated with wells drilled on leasehold acreage. ExxonMobil West Texas and New Mexico In September 2004, Apache acquired interests from ExxonMobil in 23 mature producing oil and gas fields in West Texas and New Mexico for $318 million. Apache separately contributed approximately $29 million into a partnership to obtain additional interests in the properties. ExxonMobil will retain interests in the properties through the partnership, including the right to receive, on certain fields, 60 percent of the oil proceeds above $30 per barrel in 2004, $29 per barrel in 2005 and $28 per barrel during the period from 2006 thru 2009. ExxonMobil Louisiana and Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Also in September 2004, Apache and ExxonMobil entered into joint exploration agreements to explore Apaches acreage in South Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf. The agreements provide for an initial term of five years, with the potential for an additional five years based on expenditures by ExxonMobil. Pursuant to the agreement covering South Louisiana, Apache leased 50 percent of its interests below certain producing or productive formations in the acreage to ExxonMobil, subject to retention of a 20 percent royalty interest. Pursuant to the agreement covering the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf, no assignments will be made until a prospect has been proposed and the initial well has been drilled. Apache will retain all rights in each prospect above certain producing or productive formations and further will retain a three percent overriding royalty interest in any property assigned to ExxonMobil. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a complete discussion of those transactions. Anadarko On August 20, 2004, Apache signed a definitive agreement to acquire all of Anadarko Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf properties (excluding certain deepwater properties) for $537 million, subject to normal post closing adjustments, including preferential rights. The transaction was effective as of October 1, 2004, and included interests in 74 fields covering 232 offshore blocks (approximately 664,000 acres) and 104 platforms. Eighty nine of the blocks were undeveloped at the time of the acquisition. Apache operates 49 of the fields comprising approximately 70 percent of the production. Prior to Apaches purchase from Anadarko, Morgan Stanley paid Anadarko $646 million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in these properties. Anadarkos sale of an overriding royalty interest to Morgan Stanley is commonly known in the industry as a volumetric production payment (VPP), the obligations of which Apache assumed along with its subsequent purchase. Under the terms of the VPP, Morgan Stanley is to receive a fixed volume of oil and natural gas production (20 MMboe) over four years beginning in October 2004. The VPP represents a non operating interest in the properties that is free of all costs of operations and production. Morgan Stanley is entitled to first production and may receive up to 90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by the VPP in any given month to satisfy these deliverables. However, Morgan Stanley has no right to look to other assets or production of Apache. The VPP is scheduled to terminate on August 31, 2008, but may be extended if all scheduled VPP volumes have not been delivered to Morgan Stanley and the properties are still producing. The VPP includes restrictions on the Companys ability to sell the properties subject to the VPP or resign as operator of VPP properties it currently operates. Upon termination of the VPP, all rights, titles and interests revert back to Apache. Apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the VPP. The strategic rationale for Apache buying these assets burdened by a volumetric production payment is several fold. First, because Morgan Stanley gets their production first and Apache receives the remainder, Morgan Stanley is paying substantially more per boe, thereby significantly reducing Apaches cost per unit. Second, although Morgan Stanleys priority call on production leaves Apache with more risk, in exchange we 22 retain all the upside associated with finding more reserves on the acquired properties than anticipated at the time of the acquisition. This is a risk/reward scenario with which we are comfortable and that plays to our long history of adding value to numerous acquired properties through proactive operations. Third, our experience is that invariably we earn higher rates of return from drilling and related activities than we do from acquisitions. Yet acquisitions bring an inventory of drilling and exploitation opportunities. Because Morgan Stanley paid Anadarko more than Apache for proved reserves, a higher percentage of Apaches investment will be concentrated in the higher risk but generally higher reward, future drilling activity. As a final note, Morgan Stanley, while having less risk, is not risk free. In the event that the properties purchased by Apache are insufficient to deliver the volumes sold to Morgan Stanley, there is no recourse to any properties other than those acquired from Anadarko. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this item for further discussion of VPPs. The $537 million purchase price agreed to in the definitive agreement was subsequently adjusted for the exercise of preferential rights by third parties and other normal post closing adjustments. After adjusting for these items, Apache paid $532 million for the properties and recorded estimated proved reserves of 60 MMboe, of which 50 percent is natural gas. In addition, an $84 million liability for the future cost to produce and deliver the VPP volumes was recorded by the Company. This liability will be amortized as the volumes are produced and delivered to Morgan Stanley. Apache also recorded abandonment obligations for the properties of approximately $134 million and other obligations assumed from Anadarko in the amount of $27 million. Apache allocated $122 million of the purchase price to unproved property. The purchase price was funded by borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program. 2003 Acquisitions In 2003, we spent $1.6 billion on oil and gas acquisitions, adding 267 MMboe to our reserve base. The preponderance of our 2003 acquisition activity was focused in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In January 2003, we agreed to purchase from BP the North Sea Forties Field offshore the United Kingdom and properties in the Gulf of Mexico. The BP purchase, representing 72 percent of our 2003 acquisition capital expenditures, established a new international core area and augmented our Gulf of Mexico portfolio. In July 2003, we consummated a deal with Shell adding additional oil and gas fields on the outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Apache recorded 27.4 MMboe of reserves from the Shell acquisition, with interest in 26 fields and two onshore gas plants. The balance of our 2003 activity involved smaller acquisitions in Australia and North America. In association with the BP acquisition, Apache agreed to sell all of the production from the North Sea properties to BP for a two year period ending December 31, 2004 at a combination of fixed and market sensitive prices pursuant to a contract entered into in connection with the North Sea purchase agreement. To protect the acquisition economics on the Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from BP we hedged prices on a substantial portion of the oil production for a 12 month period ending January 31, 2004, and a substantial portion of the gas production for the first two years. Prior to Apaches transaction with Shell, Morgan Stanley paid Shell $300 million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in a portion of the reserves to be produced and delivered under a VPP agreement. Under the terms of the VPP obligation which Apache assumed, Morgan Stanley is to receive a total of 11.4 MMboe of production from the properties over the period from August 2003 through October 2007. Morgan Stanley is entitled to first production and may receive up to 90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by the VPP, but Morgan Stanley may look only to the acquired properties for delivery of the scheduled volumes. The VPP may be extended beyond October 2007 if all scheduled VPP volumes have not been delivered to Morgan Stanley and the acquired properties are still producing. The VPP is a non operating interest free of all costs associated with operations and production. As a result of this VPP obligation, Apache recorded a $60 million liability for the future cost to produce and deliver volumes subject to the VPP. This liability is being amortized as the volumes are produced and delivered to Morgan Stanley. Apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the VPP. 23 Our acquisitions help maintain diversity in terms of hydrocarbon product (oil or gas), geologic risk and geographic location. As shown in Note 14, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, our North American 2004 and 2003 year end reserves were 70 percent of total reserves. Our 2004 North American average daily production as a percent of our total production decreased to 59 percent from 64 percent in 2003. While the U.S., a highly stable political environment, remains our largest producing core area, Apache will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in existing core areas and in new areas should they arise. We routinely evaluate our property portfolio and divest those that are marginal or no longer fit into our strategic growth program. We divested $4 million, $59 million and $7 million of properties during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. REVENUES Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Given the current tightly balanced supply demand market, small variations in either supply or demand, or both, can have dramatic effects on prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while other economic factors could impact demand. Oil and Natural Gas Prices While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a world wide market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions. However, throughout 2004 the quality differential between prices we received for our North American sour crude oil compared to the NYMEX index prices widened, with a substantial increase in the fourth quarter of 2004. These quality differentials, which impacted approximately 30 percent of our North American production, occurred largely because OPEC produced more sour crude to satisfy rising world demand, while worldwide sour crude refining capacity remained the same. This excess in sour crude supply over the refining capacity created competition between the producers driving a deeper discount for sour crude. In the fourth quarter, we received an average of $41.00 per barrel for sour crude, approximately $5.00 less than we received for our sweet crude. Apache primarily sells its natural gas into three markets: 1) North America, which has a common market and where production is currently in short supply relative to demand creating a volatile pricing environment; 2) Australia, which has a local market with limited demand and infrastructure and generally long term fixed prices; and 3) Egypt, which has a local market where the price received for our production is indexed to a weighted average Dated Brent crude oil price, a portion of which is subject to a minimum floor price and maximum ceiling price. The current outlook for 2005 indicates that the sour crude quality differentials while narrowing somewhat, will remain above historical averages. All of our North Sea production will trade at market prices, following expiration on December 31, 2004, of a fixed price contract on 40,000 b/d. For specific marketing arrangements by segment, please refer to Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties of this Form 10 K. 24 Contributions to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues As with production and reserves, a consequence of geographic diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues and natural gas revenues. For the reasons discussed in the Oil and Natural Gas Price section above, contributions to oil revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately. The following table presents each segments oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues, respectively. OIL REVENUES GAS REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 United States....................................... 32% 33% 35% 58% 62% 51% Canada.............................................. 12% 13% 16% 29% 27% 29% North America....................................... 44% 46% 51% 87% 89% 80% Egypt............................................... 24% 23% 29% 10% 8% 15% Australia........................................... 13% 16% 20% 3% 3% 5% North Sea........................................... 16% 13% Other International................................. 3% 2% Total........................................ 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% Crude Oil Contribution In 2004, oil revenues from areas outside the U.S. rose slightly to 68 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 67 percent in 2003. Lack of production growth reduced the U.S. overall contribution one percent to 32 percent of consolidated oil revenues. Canadas contribution also declined one percent to 12 percent on lower relative production growth. Egypts share rose one percent to 24 percent as it saw both price gains and production growth. The North Seas contribution increased three percent on both an increase in average daily production and a full year of revenues versus nine months in 2003. Australias contribution fell three percent on lower production. In 2003, oil revenues from areas outside the U.S. rose to 67 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 65 percent in 2002. The increase is directly related to the acquisition of the North Sea properties and, to a much lesser extent, initial production from China. The percentage contribution from all other areas fell, reflecting the impact of revenues from the North Sea and China. Natural Gas Contribution A significant portion of the Companys natural gas revenues comes from our North American operations. In 2004, 87 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from North America of which 58 percent was from the U.S. and 29 percent was from Canada. The U.S. contribution decreased four percent from 2003, primarily because of production declines, the impact Hurricane Ivan had on U.S. Gulf of Mexico revenues, and the additional revenues generated by Canada and Egypt. Our U.S. Gulf Coast region, which contributed 69 percent of Apaches U.S. 2004 production, down two percent from 2003, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial production rates followed by steep declines when compared to most other U.S. producing areas. Canadas contribution was up two percent from 2003 resulting from three percent production growth and higher price gains relative to other areas. Egypts contribution to total gas revenues increased to 10 percent from eight percent in 2003, on 21 percent production growth. Australias contribution to 2004 natural gas revenues remained the same as 2003 at three percent. In 2003, 89 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from North America, 62 percent from the U.S. and 27 percent from Canada. The U.S. contribution rose 11 percent from 2002, primarily because of the properties acquired from BP and Shell in 2003, and properties acquired in South Louisiana in December 2002. Canadas contribution was down two percent from 2002 primarily because of the production growth in the U.S. Egypts contribution to total gas revenues declined to eight percent from 15 percent in 2002. Egypts total 25 natural gas revenues were relatively flat year over year, as higher natural gas prices were offset by lower net production. Australias contribution to 2003 natural gas revenues declined to three percent from five percent in 2002. The table below presents oil and gas production revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids.

Higher production added the remaining $38 million. While all of our operating segments reported an increase in natural gas price realizations, most of the additional revenues attributable to price came from the U.S. and Canada. The additional revenues attributable to production were primarily generated in Egypt, where natural gas production increased 21 percent, reflecting the success of our drilling program. Canada and Australia also contributed to the increase in production revenues with production growth of three percent and six percent, respectively. Canadas increase is from new wells while Australias increase was driven by higher customer demand and new contractual sales. Partially offsetting these additional production revenues was a three percent decrease in U.S. production. The lower U.S. production was focused in the Gulf Coast region and is related to the impact of Hurricane Ivan and natural decline in mature fields. Consolidated natural gas revenues increased $916 million in 2003, consistent with a $1.74 per Mcf increase in the average price realized for natural gas and a 13 percent increase in production. The price increase generated $686 million of revenues while production growth added another $230 million. U.S. production increased 32 percent, reflecting the impact from the 2003 BP and Shell acquisitions and the December 2002 South Louisiana acquisition. Offsetting the U.S. production growth were lower production in Egypt, Australia, and Canada, down seven percent, six percent, and three percent, respectively. The decline in Egypt related to gas production curtailment imposed by EGPC and scheduled plant shutdowns, while Australia experienced lower customer demand. Apache uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, including fixed price physical contracts and derivatives. Although a majority of our worldwide sales contracts are indexed to prevailing market prices, approximately nine percent of our 2004 and 2003 domestic natural gas production was subject to long term, fixed price physical contracts. The long term, fixed price physical contracts apply to a small portion of our U.S. future natural gas production and provide a measure of protection to the Company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices. These contracts negatively impacted our 2004 and 2003 realized prices by $.10 per Mcf and $.08 per Mcf, respectively. Additionally, substantially all of our natural gas production sold in Australia is subject to long term fixed price supply contracts. These contracts are periodically adjusted for changes in Australias consumer price index and are also impacted by 27 changes in the value of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. In 2004, we saw an increase in our realized prices primarily because of the stronger Australian dollar. Approximately 16 percent of our worldwide natural gas production was subject to financial derivative hedging for 2004 and 2003. Refer to Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a summary of current derivative positions and terms. We also amortized unrealized gains and losses from derivative positions closed in October and November 2001, which had no impact on 2004 average realized prices. The following table shows the impact on average prices for these financial derivatives: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 (PER MCF) Derivatives................................................. $(.20) $(.01) $ Amortization................................................ (.01) .04 Crude Oil Revenues Our 2004 consolidated oil revenues increased $905 million with a $7.48 per barrel increase in our average realized oil price generating an additional $561 million of revenues. A 13 percent growth in production added the remaining $344 million. The increase in production came from the North Sea, China and Egypt. North Sea production is up 23,576 b/d, with 53 percent of the increase reflecting additional production from new wells and operational enhancements. The balance of the North Sea increase results from reporting a full year of production in 2004 versus nine months in 2003. A portion of the North Sea revenue was tied to an average $23.38 per barrel fixed price sales contract entered into in at the time of the BP acquisition. This two year contract expired at the end of 2004. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a discussion of the terms of this contract. Production in China, which commenced in July 2003, added 4,792 b/d on exploration and production activity and a full year of production. Egypts production is up 4,632 b/d on exploration and production activity. These production increases were partially offset by lower production in the U.S. and Australia, down 1,532 b/d and 5,415 b/d, respectively. The U.S. decline is related to Hurricane Ivan, downtime, and natural decline in mature fields. Australias decrease was driven by natural decline. Consolidated oil revenues increased $698 million in 2003 with a 34 percent increase in oil production generating an additional $531 million of revenues. The average crude oil realized price increased $2.98 per barrel, adding the remaining $167 million of oil revenues. Revenues from properties acquired in the North Sea accounted for over half of the oil revenue increase attributable to production. U.S. production increased 31 percent, primarily from the Gulf of Mexico BP properties and to a lesser extent from properties acquired from Shell and in South Louisiana in December 2002. Initial production from China and a nine percent increase in production from Egypt also contributed to the revenue gains. Apache also manages its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices using financial derivatives. Approximately four percent and 22 percent of our worldwide crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedging for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Please refer to Note 3, Hedging and Derivature of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a summary of current derivative positions and terms. We also continued to amortize unrealized gains and losses over the original production life of derivative positions closed in October and November 2001, which had no impact on 2004 average realized prices. The following table shows the impact on prices of these financial derivatives: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 (PER BBL) Derivatives................................................. $(.21) $(.95) $ Amortization................................................ .03 .15 28 COSTS The tables below present a comparison of our costs on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis.

The UOP calculation in simplest terms multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter times the costs of those reserves. The result is to recognize expense at the same pace that the reservoirs are actually depleting. The costs in the UOP calculation include both the net capitalized amounts on the balance sheet, and the estimated future costs to access and develop reserves needing additional facilities, equipment or downhole work in order to produce. Under the full cost method of accounting, the DD&A calculation is prepared separately for each country in which Apache operates. Absolute DD&A determines the expense reported each period, while the cost per unit of production (DD&A rate) provides insight into the overall costs of the companys reserves growth. Current costs incurred to drill or acquire additional reserves that are higher than the historical cost level raises the overall DD&A rate. Conversely, if reserves are added in the current period at a rate per unit less than existing levels, they average down the companys DD&A rate. Changes from period to period in absolute DD&A expense are determined by production levels, the mix of production (high cost country versus a low cost country) and the impact of recent spending (higher or lower DD&A rates). Full cost DD&A expense of $1.1 billion, increased $146 million compared to 2003. Approximately 59 percent of the increase in absolute costs was related to higher production levels, mainly in the North Sea, Egypt and China. The balance was primarily attributable to higher drilling costs, as our 2004 DD&A rate increased $.42 to $7.01 per boe. The increase in per unit costs is primarily attributable to our North American operations where high commodity prices have led to increased demand for drilling services and thus higher drilling costs. Additionally, high commodity prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and therefore, the cost of properties we acquired in 2004 were higher than our historical cost. A full years production from China, which carries the second highest DD&A rate in the Company, also contributed to the increase in the worldwide rate. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the DD&A rate in Egypt from a successful exploration and development program which added significant reserves through drilling at lower costs. Our 2003 full cost DD&A expense of $1 billion increased $220 million compared to 2002. The majority of the increase in absolute costs was related to production increases following our acquisitions from BP and Shell in the Gulf of Mexico and from BP in the North Sea and first production in China. On a per unit basis, our DD&A rate in 2003 increased $.30 to $6.59 from $6.29 in 2002. The increase was driven by higher drilling 29 costs in Australia, Egypt and the U.S. and higher acquisition costs in the U.S. In addition, China and the North Sea contributed to the increase in per unit rates, with production reported for the first time in 2003 at higher DD&A rates than other regions. Depreciation of other assets increased $3 million in 2004, in line with our overall growth. Impairments We assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of acreage. When an impairment occurs, costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. Impairments in international areas without proved reserves are charged to earnings upon determination that impairment has occurred. In 2002, we impaired $20 million in Poland ($12 million after tax). In 2003, we impaired the final $13 million ($8 million after tax) of unproved property costs in Poland. Goodwill became subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment in 2002. Goodwill totaled $189 million on December 31, 2004 and no impairment was recorded in either 2004 or 2003. For further discussion, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Lease Operating Costs Lease operating costs (LOE) are generally comprised of several components; direct operating costs, repair and maintenance costs, workover costs and ad valorem tax costs. LOE is driven in part by the type of commodity produced, the level of workover activity and the geographical location of the properties. Oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy enabling us to exploit our existing reserve base by accelerating production and taking advantage of high commodity prices. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote plants and facilities. Commodity prices and exchange rates also impact LOE. Historically, electricity, fuel and other service costs have risen in high commodity price environments, leading to an increase in industry wide LOE. Rising per unit operating costs remained a challenge in 2004, especially in North America. The Company reviews production costs in each of its core areas on a monthly basis and pursues alternatives in maintaining efficient levels of costs. Fluctuations in exchange rates also impact the Companys LOE in Canada, Australia and the North Sea. The dollar has generally weakened against these currencies, particularly in 2004, increasing the impact of foreign exchange rates on the Companys per unit costs in these countries. The following discussion will focus on per unit operating costs as this is the most informative method of analyzing LOE trends. Acquisitions increase absolute LOE costs, but they do not necessarily increase per unit costs or lower margins. On a per unit/boe produced basis, 2004 LOE increased $.68 to $5.27 per boe. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in industry wide service costs in North America with higher commodity prices (see discussion in preceding paragraph), the increase in currency exchange rates in Canada, North Sea and Australia, and higher expense resulting from our incentive programs, primarily stock based programs which we began expensing in 2003. Per unit costs were also negatively impacted by the combined impact of lost production and additional costs related to Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico and higher repair and maintenance costs in Australia. These increases offset the impact of a $2.75 decline in the unit cost in the North Sea, where our investments to increase production and lower operating costs over the long term are beginning to pay off. During 2003, the Company LOE per boe increased $.92 to $4.59, with all of the increase occurring outside the U.S. Half of the increase was attributable to our acquisition of the North Sea Forties field, which is located offshore, produces oil and carries a higher unit rate than our other core areas. Upon taking over operations, we performed multiple platform turnarounds and repair and maintenance projects aimed at increasing production efficiency and lowering operating costs over the long term. The remainder of the increase was related to an increase in currency exchange rates, the impact of higher commodity prices in Canada, more workover activity in Egypt and higher repair and maintenance costs in Australia. The LOE rate 30 in the U.S. declined as the impact from the additional absolute costs associated with the acquisitions were more than offset by the incremental production. Gathering and Transportation Costs Apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two types of agreements, typical in our industry. Both types of agreements include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which Apache sells oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collects a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. In this case, the Company records sales at the price received from the purchaser which is net of transportation costs. Under the other arrangement, Apache sells oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pays transportation to a third party carrier and receives from the purchaser a price with no transportation deduction. In this case, the Company records the transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. The Companys treatment of transportation costs is pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 10, "Accounting or Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs" and as a result a portion of our transporting costs is reflected in sales prices and a portion is reflected as Gathering and Transportation Costs rendering the separately identified transportation costs incomplete. In both the U.S. and Canada, Apache sells oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, Apache pays transportation to a third party carrier and receives a purchase price with no transportation deduction. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In China, we incur costs for barges to transport crude oil to onshore terminal facilities. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production has historically been sold to EGPC under netback arrangements. Apache exported three inaugural cargoes of Egyptian crude oil in 2004 pursuant to netback arrangements with third parties. Future export cargoes may be sold under similar terms or Apache may arrange shipping and receive prices without transportation deductions. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs paid directly by Apache to third party carriers for each of the periods presented. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 (IN MILLIONS) U.S. ....................................................... $28 $21 $17 Canada...................................................... 31 28 21 North Sea................................................... 22 11 China....................................................... 1 Total Gathering and Transportation.......................... $82 $60 $38 These costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our North American operations and crude oil in the North Sea. Transportation costs in the U.S. increased 33 percent on higher volumes transported under third party transportation contracts, compared to the prior year period. Canadas 2004 costs were 11 percent higher than 2003 because of an increase in third party transportation rates and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The North Seas costs increased on production growth and a full year of production. In 2003, the increase in Canada primarily involved higher third party transportation charges for gas transported from several fields, increased production volumes from 2002 acquisitions and transportation charges for crude oil as we began taking our oil "in kind" and marketing it ourselves instead of selling it at the lease. The increase in the U.S. is related to the higher volumes transported under third party transportation contracts, compared to the prior year period. In the North Sea, these costs are related to the transportation of crude oil upon our entry to the region in April 2003. Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes are comprised primarily of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia. In both 2004 and 2003, these severance taxes, which are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, represented the majority of the total 31 severance and other taxes incurred. The other tax components are primarily made up of the Australian Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), to which Apache first became subject in 2002, the Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) on the North Sea properties and the Canadian Large Corporation Tax, Saskatchewan Capital Tax, Saskatchewan Resource Surtax and Freehold Mineral Tax. Oil and gas production revenues generated from Egypt, Canada and the North Sea are not subject to severance taxes. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 (IN MILLIONS) Severance taxes............................................. $127 $ 77 $53 U.K. PRT.................................................... (61) 20 Canadian taxes.............................................. 23 20 10 Other....................................................... 5 5 4 Total Severance and Other Taxes............................. $ 94 $122 $67 In 2004, severance and other taxes decreased 23 percent, or $28 million. Severance and other taxes in the U.S. increased $15 million, in line with higher production revenues. Australias taxes increased $36 million as production from the Legendre field crossed a cumulative threshold, triggering an excise tax. U.K. PRT tax is based on revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending. Apache was in a PRT credit position for 2004 as deductible capital spending exceeded taxable cash flows from the Forties field. Canadian taxes increased $3 million on an increase in Freehold Mineral Taxes. In 2003, severance and other taxes increased 81 percent, or $54 million. Twenty million dollars of the increase is associated with PRT expense in the North Sea, where Apache began operating in April 2003. Canadian taxes increased $10 million as a result of currency exchange rate increases and higher prices in 2003, and a $2 million refund in 2002. U.S. and Australia severance taxes increased $17 million and $7 million, respectively, in line with higher production revenues. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses (G&A) of $1.06 per boe for 2004 increased $.15 per boe over 2003. Absolute costs increased $35 million, or 25 percent. Over $21 million, or 61 percent of the additional expense is related to the impact Apaches rising stock price had on stock based compensation programs and incremental incentive compensation. The impact from the higher stock price stems from Apaches decision, effective January 1, 2003, to expense stock based compensation plans (see Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 in this Form 10 K). Approximately $3 million, or 8 percent, of the increase is related to our new North Sea operations, with the first full year of operations in 2004. The balance of the increase was related to higher audit and tax fees, increased insurance premiums, and expansion of the Companys gas marketing group. General and administrative expenses of $.91 per boe for 2003 increased $.07 per boe over 2002. Absolute costs increased $34 million, or 32 percent. Over $11 million, or 34 percent, is associated with expensing compensation, including Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), stock options, restricted stock and incremental incentive compensation. Approximately $9 million, or 28 percent, of the increase is related to our new North Sea operations. The balance of the increase was related to the Companys decision to increase its charitable contributions, expansion of the Companys new gas marketing group and transition costs incurred on acquisitions. Financing Costs, Net The major components of financing costs, net, include interest expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs were slightly higher than in 2003. Gross interest expense decreased $1 million in 2004, a result of a lower average debt balance. This decrease was offset by a $2 million decrease in the amount of interest 32 capitalized, a result of a lower average unproved property balance. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2004 was 6.1 percent compared to 6.4 percent on December 31, 2003. Net financing costs for 2003 increased $2 million compared to 2002 with a $13 million increase in expense largely offset by an increase in capitalized interest. Five million dollars of the increase is interest expense related to the write off of unamortized fees triggered by the retirement of preferred interests of subsidiaries discussed below. The remaining $8 million of higher interest expense was attributable to a higher average debt balance in 2003 compared to 2002. Capitalized interest increased $12 million driven by a higher unproved property balance associated with acquisitions and an active drilling program. If net financing costs included distributions from Preferred Interests of Subsidiaries, net financing costs would have decreased by approximately $5 million. Provision for Income Taxes 2004 income tax expense of $993 million was $166 million or 20 percent higher than in 2003. The higher taxes were primarily associated with higher income driven by higher oil and gas production revenues in 2004. Our effective tax rate was 37.29 percent in 2004 compared to 43.02 percent in 2003. The 2003 effective tax rate included $172 million of additional deferred tax expense because of currency fluctuations compared to $58 million in 2004. 2003 income tax expense of $827 million was $482 million or 140 percent higher than the 2002. The higher taxes were primarily associated with higher income in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate increased primarily because of $172 million of additional deferred tax expenses resulting from currency fluctuations. The impact caused by currency fluctuations was partially offset by a $71 million reduction in deferred tax expense related to a reduction in Canadian federal statutory income tax rates. Our effective tax rate for 2003 was 43.02 percent compared to 38.34 percent for the prior year.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY FINANCIAL INDICATORS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXCEPT AS INDICATED Current ratio............................................... 1.05 1.10 1.44 Net cash provided by operation activities................... $3,232 $2,706 $1,381 Total debt(1)............................................... 2,588 2,327 2,595 Shareholders equity........................................ 8,204 6,533 4,924 Percent of total debt to capitalization(1).................. 24% 26% 35% Floating rate debt/total debt(1)............................ 15% 6% 29% (1) Year end 2002 debt included $437 million of preferred interests of subsidiaries. The Company retired its preferred interests of subsidiaries in September 2003. OVERVIEW Apaches primary uses of cash are exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs and expenses necessary to maintain continued operations, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will shrink. Cash investments are continuously required to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves. See Item 1 and 2, Business and Properties, "Risks Factors Related to Our Business and Operations," in this Form 10 K. Future success in maintaining 33 and growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on having adequate capital resources available, on our success in both exploration and development activities and on acquiring additional reserves. Our year end reserve life index indicates an average decline of 8.5 percent per year. This projection is based on prices at year end, except in those instances where future natural gas and oil sales are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or lower amounts, estimates of investments required to develop estimated proved undeveloped reserves, costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in Note 14, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through net cash provided by operating activities (cash flow) and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flow. Our cash flow, both in the short and long term, is impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, we only forecast, for internal use by management, an annual cash flow. Longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are not used by management to operate our business. The annual cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to the adjusted cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs. The Company has historically utilized internally generated cash flow, committed and uncommitted credit facilities and access to both debt and equity capital markets for all other liquidity and capital resources needs. Apaches ability to access the debt capital market is supported by its investment grade credit ratings. Because of the liquidity and capital resources alternatives available to Apache, including internally generated cash flows, Apaches management believes that its short term and long term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including its capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Apaches senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by Moodys, Standard and Poors and Fitch with ratings of A3, A and A, respectively. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.05 at December 31, 2004 compared to 1.10 at the end of last year. Year end 2004 current receivable and payable balances increased by $450 million and $463 million, respectively, from December 31, 2003. The increase in current receivables was primarily attributable to the impact of higher commodities prices and increased production on receivables from the sale of oil and natural gas. In addition, current receivables include amounts collectible from insurance proceeds for lost production and physical damage resulting from Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in current payables is primarily attributable to an increase in trade payables because of an increased number of drilling and development projects in progress at the end of 2004 versus year end 2003 and the impact of higher commodity prices and production on revenue payable to third party royalty and working interest owners. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2004 totaled $3.2 billion, up from $2.7 billion in 2003. The increase in 2004 cash flow is attributed primarily to the significant increase in commodity prices. The Companys averaged realized oil and natural gas prices increased 27 and 7 percent, respectively; a reflection of higher worldwide commodity prices. Higher production also increased our 2004 cash flow. Oil and natural gas production increased 13 and one percent, respectively, a result of acquisitions and a successful drilling program. These increases were partially offset by higher production costs attributable to the effect of increased commodity prices, an increase in exchange rates in Canada, North Sea and Australia, costs related to Hurricane Ivan and increases in costs from our stock based employee incentive programs. The Company reviews production costs for each core area on a monthly basis and pursues alternatives in maintaining efficient levels of costs and expenses. For a more detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, costs and expenses, please refer to the Results of Operations section of this Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 34 Apaches 2003 cash flows totaled $2.7 billion, an increase of 96 percent from 2002 cash flows of $1.4 billion. The increase was attributable primarily to higher oil and gas production revenues which were driven by increases in both production volumes and realized prices and partially offset by higher operating expenses. Oil and natural gas production increased 34 and 13 percent, respectively. The increase in oil production was primarily attributable to our acquisition of properties in the North Sea and first production from our China operations. The increase in natural gas production was primarily related to two significant acquisitions in the Gulf of Mexico, which offset declines in other core areas. Oil and natural gas prices increased 12 and 61 percent, respectively on higher worldwide commodity prices. Higher lease operating costs were primarily attributable to the acquisition of the North Sea properties, which carry a higher rate per unit than our other core areas, and where, upon taking over operations, we performed multiple platform turnarounds and repair and maintenance projects aimed at increasing production and lowering operating costs over the long term. Outside of the United States, costs were higher with an increase in exchange rates and the impact of higher commodity prices in Canada, more workover activity in Egypt and higher repair and maintenance costs in Australia. For a more detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, operating costs and acquisitions please refer to the Results of Operations section of this Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Historically, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Companys short term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Sales volume changes have also impacted cash flow in the short term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in the past. Apaches long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations. DEBT During 2004, we continued to strengthen our financial flexibility and to build on the solid financial positions of previous years. We exited 2004 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 24 percent, a decrease of two percent from year end 2003, with slightly higher debt offset by increases in equity resulting from earnings. At year end 2004 the Company had long term debt of $2.6 billion, $261 million higher than year end 2003, as the Companys $3.4 billion in capital spending slightly exceeded internally generated cash flow. The Companys outstanding debt consisted of $396 million under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit and a total of $2.2 billion of other debt. This other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years 2006 through 2096. Approximately $.3 million, $173 million, $.4 million, $497 million and $1.9 billion mature in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and thereafter, respectively. During 2004, the Company maintained its senior unsecured long term debt ratings of A3 from Moodys and A from Standard and Poors. In June 2004, Fitch upgraded Apaches senior unsecured long term debt rating from A to A. The Company has a $1.2 billion commercial paper program which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper balances of $392 million and $130 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such amounts on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under its U.S. credit facilities. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. credit facilities are available as a 100 percent backstop. The weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was 1.79 percent in 2004 and 1.19 percent in 2003. As of December 31, 2004, available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities was $1.1 billion. We had $111 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2004, an increase from $34 million at the prior year end. On May 28, 2004, the Companys $750 million 364 day U.S. credit facility matured and was replaced with a new five year credit facility which matures May 28, 2009. Also on this date, the Company amended its existing $450 million facility and its two existing $150 million facilities in order to make their terms consistent with the new five year facility. Significant changes included raising the cross default threshold, increasing 35 flexibility under the negative lien covenant and eliminating covenants which established minimum levels for tangible net worth and book values for assets of Apache and certain subsidiaries. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the Companys consolidated assets, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2004. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group. There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2004. STOCK TRANSACTIONS The Company periodically uses access to equity capital markets to fund significant acquisitions. On January 22, 2003, in conjunction with the BP transaction, we completed a public offering of approximately 19.8 million shares of common stock, including 2.6 million shares for the underwriters over allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million. The Company currently has no plans to access equity capital markets. The Companys board of directors approved a stock split and several stock dividends in 2003, 2002 and 2001; a reflection of their belief that we can reward our shareholders while remaining focused on our primary objective of building Apache to last by achieving profitable growth. On December 18, 2003, we announced that holders of our common stock approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to 430 million from 215 million in order to complete a previously announced two for one stock split. The record date for the stock split was December 31, 2003 and the additional shares were distributed on January 14, 2004. On December 18, 2002, our Board of Directors declared a five percent stock dividend payable on April 2, 2003 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2003. As a result, in December 2002, we reclassified approximately $396 million from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital, which represents the fair market value at the date of declaration of the shares distributed. In 2003, at the date of the distribution, an additional $26 million was reclassified from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital. No fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares. On May 15, 2002, we completed the mandatory conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock into approximately 13.1 million common shares. OIL AND GAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES The Company funded its exploration and production (E&D) capital expenditures, including Gathering, Transportation and Marketing (GTM) facilities, of $2.5 billion, $1.5 billion and $892 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily with internally generated cash flow of $3.2 billion, $2.7 billion and $1.4 billion. The Company uses a combination of internally generated cash flow, borrowings under the Companys lines of credit and commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund its significant acquisitions. During the three year period presented, the Company primarily used 36 internally generated cash flow or its lines of credit and commercial paper program; which were subsequently paid down with internally generated cash flow. However, in 2003 in conjunction with the BP acquisition, the Company completed a public offering of approximately 19.8 million shares of common stock, including 2.6 million shares for the underwriters over allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million. The following table presents a summary of the Companys Capital Expenditures for each of our reportable segments for the past three years. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 (IN THOUSANDS) Exploration and Development: United States............................................ $ 755,056 $ 417,701 $302,611 Canada................................................... 756,912 568,856 258,191 Egypt.................................................... 301,912 242,652 171,160 Australia................................................ 138,694 128,261 89,813 North Sea................................................ 362,054 60,204 Other International...................................... 26,493 35,098 38,409 $2,341,121 $1,452,772 $860,184 Capitalized Interest....................................... $ 50,748 $ 52,891 $ 40,691 Gas Gathering Transmission and Processing Facilities....... $ 138,738 $ 38,533 $ 32,155 Acquisitions: Oil and gas properties................................... $1,063,851 $1,568,106 $351,707 Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities.... 5,484 2,875 $1,063,851 $1,573,590 $354,582 In 2004, Apache drilled a record number of wells and completed two significant acquisitions. Each of our North America operating areas drilled a record number of wells in 2004. In the Gulf of Mexico the majority of our activity focused in and around our existing asset base, including continued exploitation of the properties purchased from BP and Shell in 2003 and the Anadarko properties purchased in 2004. In the Central region, where Apache got its start 50 years ago, estimated proved reserves increased 20 percent in 2004 through a combination of the ExxonMobil acquisition and Apaches most active drilling year, completing 268 of 283 wells in the region. Canada was our most active area with over 1,300 wells drilled, three fourths of which were shallow development wells, with over 92 percent completed as producers. At the Forties Field, an experienced workforce is tackling projects to extend the life of the largest field in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. Production increases at Forties the anchor of Apaches newest core area were driven by Apaches first drilling program since acquiring the field and a maintenance program aimed at improving efficiency of the field. During 2004, Apache completed 12 of 17 wells drilled as part of a $362 million capital program, including $150 million of maintenance and operations capital expenditures. In Egypt and Australia, Apache continued its successful exploration programs with several new discoveries. Our continuing development program in Egypt increased gross production to over 100,000 b/d for the first time. Capital expenditures in China decreased in 2004 with the completion of production facilities and first production in the second half of 2003. In 2004, Apache added 444.7 MMboe of estimated proved reserves through acquisitions, drilling and revisions. During 2004, GTM expenditures included additional gathering system pipelines in Egypt and a gas plant expansion on Varanus Island in Australia. In 2003, E&D capital expenditures increased approximately $593 million over the previous year with more drilling and development activity in each of our cores areas. Apache drilled more wells than it ever had in Canada, completing 913 of 984 wells. Apaches successful drilling program in Egypt pushed production to then all time highs and resulted in several discoveries, including the largest discovery in the history of the Company at the Qasr 1X well in the Khalda Offset Concession. In the North Sea, which Apache acquired in April 2003, we began a program of upgrades to the surface facilities to increase efficiencies. 37 For 2005, we plan another active year of drilling. Because we revise our estimates of exploration and development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry conditions and results to date, accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best. However, our preliminary estimate of exploration and development capital expenditures for 2005 is in excess of $2.5 billion. We do not project estimates for acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable. However, we continually look for properties which we believe will add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise. CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 40 consecutive years through 2004. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. Common dividends paid during 2004 rose 26 percent to $85 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend 33 percent, to eight cents per share from six cents per share, effective with the November 2004 dividend payment. During 2004, Apache paid a total of $6 million in dividends on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock were paid through May 15, 2002, when the shares automatically converted to common stock. See Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Common dividends paid during 2003 rose 19 percent to $67 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations.

Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003, the Company recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation. See Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further discussion. (b) This table does not include the Companys pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further discussion. 38 Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations. The Company has reserved approximately $11 million for environmental remediation. The Company has also reserved approximately $10 million for various legal liabilities, in addition to the $71 million, plus interest, we accrued for the Texaco China B.V. litigation. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies. In 2004, the Company accrued approximately $10 million for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a member of this insurance pool which insures specific property, pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay termination fees if Apache ever withdraws from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential termination fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued. The calculation will change annually based on future period losses incurred by OIL. As discussed under Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, Apache assumed obligations for pre existing VPPs in the 2004 acquisition of properties from Anadarko and the 2003 acquisition of properties from Shell. Under the terms of the VPP agreements, Apache is scheduled to deliver a total of 10.7 MMboe in 2005, 7.6 MMboe in 2006, 4.7 MMboe in 2007 and 1.6 MMboe in 2008 to Morgan Stanley as owner of the VPP interests. Morgan Stanley is entitled to the first production and may demand up to 90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by each VPP in any given month to satisfy the VPP interests. However, they have no right to look to other assets or production of Apache. Apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the VPPs. As of December 31, 2004, Apache has booked a total of 91 MMboe of reserves attributable to the Anadarko and Shell transactions. The VPPs are non operating interests, free of costs incurred for operations and production. Apache provided a liability for these costs as reflected in the preceding table. Upon closing of our acquisition of the North Sea properties, Apache assumed BPs abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, did not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache fails to satisfy the abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to ensure Apaches payment of these costs, Apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moodys and Standard and Poors from the Companys current ratings of A3 and A , respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change. If Apache is required to provide a letter of credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level. The letter of credit amount would be 136 million British pounds, an amount that represents the letter of credit requirement through March 2006, and will be negotiated annually based on Apaches future abandonment obligation estimates. The Companys future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys; however, we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely. The Companys credit facilities do not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail under "Capital Resources and Liquidity, Debt" in this section of this Form 10 K. In addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements, Apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the Companys credit ratings decline significantly. 39 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions. Apache entered into a partnership with ExxonMobil to obtain additional interests in specific West Texas and New Mexico oil & gas properties acquired from ExxonMobil in September 2004. As discussed in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, Apache contributed $29 million into this partnership which was determined to be a variable interest entity as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 "Variable Interest Entities." Apache concluded that they were not the primary beneficiary of the partnership and, therefore, proportionately consolidated only the Companys portion of the oil and gas properties. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES FULL COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful efforts method, costs such as geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and delay rentals, are expensed as incurred where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the net book value (full cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period (ceiling limitation). If the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation, the excess amount is charged through income. We have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these finding activities. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments. Generally, the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting. RESERVE ESTIMATES Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. As such, our reserve engineers review and revise the Companys reserve estimates at least annually. 40 Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a "ceiling" limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, their review covered 79, 78 and 68 percent of the reserve value, respectively. COSTS EXCLUDED Under the full cost method of accounting, oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects. Apache excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the Companys accounting, exploration and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred. Nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the Companys exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling individual wells. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for that country. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play. This evaluation considers among other factors, seismic data, requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital plans, and political, economic, and market conditions. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties of which we are the operator. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings. Our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. Beginning in 2001, we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and gas sales. Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in a one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. During 2004, we experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts, but our past due balance improved at year end. We have not established a reserve for these Egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid, albeit late, and have no indication that we will not be able to collect our receivable. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Prior to 2003, under the full cost method of accounting, as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections, the 41 estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations, net of the value of salvage, were included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties. In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." Apache adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as discussed in Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. SFAS No. 143 significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets ("asset retirement obligations" or "ARO"). Primarily, the new statement requires the Company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the Companys asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. As such, beginning in 2003 our depletion expense is reduced since we will deplete a discounted ARO rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted in our oil and gas property base. The lower depletion expense under SFAS No. 143 is offset, however, by accretion expense, which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing Asset Retirement Obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Also, the Company had to determine how to incorporate the asset retirement obligations into the quarterly calculation of its full cost ceiling tests (see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K). SFAS No. 143 is silent with respect to this issue and, although there were various views, the Company initially elected to perform the calculation similarly to the prior year by including expected abandonment costs as a reduction to the present value of future net revenues used to determine the ceiling limitation. The oil and gas property balance is capped by this limitation. Because abandonment costs are now reflected in the oil and gas property balance, the Company reduced the property balance by the accrued abandonment liability to place it on a comparable basis with the ceiling. In September 2004, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 106 to provide new guidance on how asset retirement obligations should impact the calculation of the ceiling test. The new guidance states that the property balance should not be adjusted; however, the expected future abandonment costs should be omitted from the present value ceiling limitation to provide for a comparable basis when performing the calculation. Based on this guidance, the Company changed its method of calculating the ceiling test as of year end and there was no material impact to the financial statements. INCOME TAXES Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in seven countries. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established, and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the Companys tax returns. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. 42 DERIVATIVES Apache uses derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign currency volatility. The Company accounts for the contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The estimated fair values of Apaches derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. For oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs. SFAS No. 133 requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be "marked to market" and reported in current period income, rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. Realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in Other. The fair value estimate of Apaches derivative contracts requires judgment; however, the Companys derivative contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data. Option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, "Commodity Risk" in this Form 10 K for commodity price sensitivity information and the Companys policies related to the use of derivatives. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION During 2002, Apache began modifying its stock compensation plans in order to reflect the cost of these plans in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As part of this effort, Apache began issuing stock appreciation rights and restricted stock and, effective January 1, 2003, adopted the expense provisions of SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," as amended, on a prospective basis for all stock options granted under the Companys existing option plans. Consistent with the Companys desire to reflect the ultimate cost of stock compensation plans on the income statement, Apache early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 R "Share Based Payment" upon the FASBs issuance of the revised statement in the fourth quarter 2004. In response to certain changes in U.S. tax laws passed in 2004, for future compensation the Company plans to make grants of stock options, rather than share appreciation rights, assuming the Companys shareholders approve a new stock option plan at the 2005 annual meeting of shareholders. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, all stock based compensation awards that vested during 2004 are now reflected in the Companys net income for the year. Awards that vested in prior years continue to be reflected in the income statement under the accounting guidelines in place for the applicable year. Awards granted in future periods will be valued on the date of grant and expensed using a straight line basis over the required service period. Pro forma income statement presentations have been provided for in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K to present a comparative basis of all plans outstanding during the reported periods. The Company chose to adopt the statement under the "Modified Retrospective" approach as prescribed under SFAS No. 123 R. Under this approach, the Company is required to expense all options and stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the stock compensation determined on the date of grant. Had the Company not early adopted SFAS No. 123 R under this transition approach, 2004 net income would have been lower by $89 million ($56 million after tax) or $.17 per diluted share. Normally, net income would be negatively impacted by adopting SFAS No. 123 R under this transition method. However, the Companys Share Appreciation Plan which triggered in 2004 has a fair market value based expense recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 R that is substantially less than the intrinsic value cost that would have been recorded under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. Please refer to Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a detailed description of the Share Appreciation Plan. Also, inherent in expensing stock options and other stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123 R are several judgments and estimates that must be made. These include determining the underlying valuation 43 methodology for stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation, such as the Companys expected stock price volatility, expected term of the employee option, expected dividend yield, the expected risk free interest rate, the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option. Changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant. For valuation purposes, Apache has historically utilized the Black Scholes option pricing model, however, the Company is currently evaluating its policy to determine if a different method should be used, such as a lattice model. Apaches next grant to substantially all Company employees is anticipated to occur in May 2005. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY RISK The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly oil price realizations, including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges, ranged from a low of $28.97 per barrel to a high of $43.82 per barrel during 2004. Average gas price realizations, including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges, ranged from a monthly low of $4.40 per Mcf to a monthly high of $5.61 per Mcf during the same period. Based on the Companys 2004 worldwide oil production levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by $85 million. Based on the Companys 2004 worldwide gas production levels, a $.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by $45 million. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes, do not exceed the "ceiling." This ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to additional DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities; however, as discussed above, sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As indicated in Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, the Company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with our 2002, 2003 and 2004 acquisitions. These positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices and were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated production. Apache has historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions. As such, the Companys use of hedging activity remains at a correspondingly low level. In 2004, financial derivative hedges represented approximately 16 percent of the total worldwide natural gas production and four percent of the total worldwide crude oil production. Heading into 2005, hedges in place were entirely related to U.S. production and represented 11 percent and six percent of worldwide production for natural gas and crude oil, respectively. 44 On December 31, 2004, the Company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of $(23) million. A 10 percent change in natural gas prices would change the fair value by plus or minus $41 million. The Company also had open oil price swap positions with a fair value of $(28) million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would reduce the fair value by $31 million. A 10 percent decrease in oil prices would increase the fair value by $28 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2004. See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for notional volumes and terms associated with the Companys derivative contracts. Apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Treasurer and other key members of Apaches management, approve and oversee these controls, which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit, limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. INTEREST RATE RISK Approximately 85 percent of the Companys year end 2004 debt is term debt with fixed interest rates, minimizing the Companys exposure to fluctuations in short term interest rates. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $396 million of floating rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in the floating interest rate (approximately 23 basis points) on these year end balances, would change annual interest expense by approximately $1 million. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2004. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts. Over half the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in Australian dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In contrast, all oil and gas production in Egypt is sold for U.S. dollars and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date. Prior to October 1, 2002, reported cash flow from Canadian operations was measured in Canadian dollars and converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported. The majority of Apaches debt in Canada is denominated in U.S. dollars and, as such, was adjusted for differences in exchange rates at each period end and recorded as Revenues and Other. In light of the continuing transformation of the U.S. and Canadian energy markets into a single energy market, we adopted the U.S. dollar as our functional currency in Canada, effective October 1, 2002. A 10 percent strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the British pound as of December 31, 2004 would result in a foreign currency net loss of approximately $68 million. This is primarily driven from foreign currency effects on the Companys deferred tax liability positions in its international operations. The Company began hedging a portion of its foreign exchange risk associated with lease operating expenditures in 2004. The Companys treasury department administers this hedging program. For information on open derivative contracts, please see Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. 45 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, capital expenditure projections, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices, may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
