ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Apache Corporation is an independent energy company whose principle business includes exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Company operates in five core countries which, collectively, contained over 99 percent of the Companys 2005 year end estimated proved reserves and accounted for over 98 percent of the Companys 2005 oil and gas production revenues. These principle operations are located in the United States, Canada, Egypt, Australia and offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea. The Companys smaller non core operations in 2005 were conducted offshore China and in Argentina. Apache adheres to a portfolio approach to provide diversity in terms of hydrocarbon mix (crude oil and natural gas), reserve life, geologic risk and geographic location. Our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through drilling, acquisitions, or a combination of both, depending on, among other things, cost levels and availability of acquisition opportunities. As we pursue growth, we continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet our future financial obligations and liquidity needs. These obligations and needs are met with cash on hand, cash generated from our operations, unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility, and the capital markets. The interest cost of debt and access to the equity markets are greatly influenced by the Companys ability to maintain both a strong balance sheet and generate ongoing 19 Table of Contents operating cash flow. For these reasons, we strive to maintain a manageable debt load that is properly balanced with equity and our single A credit ratings. We are also cognizant of the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves. Consequently, we closely monitor trends in drilling costs by operating area and the price at which properties are available for purchase, so that we may adjust our budgets accordingly and allocate funds to projects based on potential rate of return. We review operating costs monthly by operating area, on both an absolute dollar and per unit of production basis. We then compare these results to our historical norms factoring in the impact of property acquisitions and changes in industry conditions in order to actively manage individual cost elements as appropriate. Given the inherent volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices and changing industry conditions, we frequently revise our forecasts and adjust our budgets accordingly. Throughout 2005, commodity prices were very strong as the precarious supply and demand balance for crude oil and natural gas was impacted by geopolitical factors and U.S. weather events. Apaches 2005 consolidated average realized crude oil price of $51.66 was 47 percent higher than 2004, while the Companys average realized natural gas price increased 29 percent to $6.35 per Mcf. Crude oil prices were up worldwide, while natural gas price gains were mainly concentrated in North America. The Companys daily production averaged 454,495 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, up one percent from 2004, as gains were limited by the impact of U.S. hurricanes (discussed below). These historically high commodity prices and solid production drove the Companys attainment of several operational and financial milestones. 2005 Financial and operating results include: Our 2005 oil and gas revenues totaled $7.5 billion compared to $5.3 billion in 2004, a 40 percent increase. We generated earnings of $2.6 billion, $955 million higher than in 2004. On a diluted share basis, earnings increased $2.81 to $7.84 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.1 billion from 2004 to $4.3 billion. We increased production for the 26th time out of the last 27 years. Natural gas production averaged 1,264 MMcf/d compared to 1,235 MMcf/d in 2004. Crude oil production averaged 234,070 b/d versus 231,519 b/d in 2004. Daily equivalent production in the North Sea increased approximately 24 percent from 2004. The increase reflects the success of the Echo drilling program, which began in early 2004, but also includes Bravo well work and results from the Alpha and Delta drilling programs. Oil production in Australia decreased 9,795 b/d compared to 2004 on loss of East Spar liquids, where production ceased early in the year, and natural decline at Legendre. We continue to see higher industry wide service costs, particularly in North America. The steady rise in commodity prices has driven up fuel, power and ad valorem costs, while other service costs are rising with greater demand resulting from increased activity. Canadas daily gas production increased 14 percent from 2004 to 372 MMcf/d, driven by new wells drilled at Nevis, Zama and on the North Grant Lands. We also completed six of the 11 gas plants under construction during 2005. The Companys Central region increased oil production 27 percent compared to 2004. The higher production was driven by the ExxonMobil acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2004 and active drilling and recompletion programs. Estimated proved reserves grew nine percent to 2.12 billion boe, marking 2005 as our 20th consecutive year of reserve growth. Exploration and development expenditures totaled $3.4 billion, $1.0 billion higher than in 2004. Apache ended 2005 with debt at 17 percent of total capitalization, down seven percent from year end 2004. 20 Table of Contents On September 15, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors voted to increase Apaches quarterly cash dividend to 10 cents per share, effective with the November 2005 payment. Impact of 2005 Hurricanes During the third quarter of 2005, four hurricanes struck the Gulf of Mexico that impacted the Companys U.S. gulf coast operations, both onshore and offshore Louisiana and Texas. During each of these hurricanes, personnel were evacuated and production was shut in. Two of these storms, Hurricanes Dennis and Emily, required only temporary curtailment of production and caused minor damage to the Companys production platforms. The other two storms, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, caused extensive damage to both onshore and offshore production and transportation facilities. In addition to Apaches property damage, third party pipelines, terminals and processing facilities, which the Company relies upon to transport and process the crude oil and natural gas it produces, were damaged. Restoration of full production is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. The impact on operations and results follows: Production The hurricanes reduced Apaches 2005 average annual daily production of natural gas by 59 MMcf/d and of crude oil by 10,813 b/d. The bulk of the shut in production was associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which struck in late August and late September 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 59 MMcf/d of net natural gas production and 20 Mbbls/d of net crude oil production per day remained shut in. While we have seen tremendous progress in restoring production, a portion of the production may remain shut in for up to a year. Financial Results The impact on the Companys 2005 financial results included a $397 million reduction of crude oil and natural gas revenues, approximately $30 million of additional lease operating expenses (LOE) and $30 million of additional capitalized costs. The additional LOE and capitalized costs include insurance deductibles, additional premiums assessed by Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) and an accrual for an insurance contingency assessed by OIL should Apache elect to withdraw from the insurance pool. The shut in production also resulted in $57 million less depletion expense. As indicated below, the Company accrued approximately $79 million of business interruption insurance claims during the fourth quarter of 2005 in Other under Revenues and Other of the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Assessment of Damage Nine operated production platforms were lost and two were severely damaged during the storms. Production platforms lost or severely damaged during Hurricane Katrina were: Main Pass 312 JA; South Timbalier 161 A; 161 B; 161 D; South Pass (SP) 62 A; SP 62 B; West Delta (WD) 103 A; WD 103 B; WD104 C; and WD133 B. The production platform lost during Hurricane Rita was Ship Shoal 193 B. Additionally, 12 non operated structures were destroyed or severely damaged: 10 Grand Isle 43 platforms; one South Marsh Island 108 platform; and one Eugene Island 330 platform. Prior to the hurricanes, aggregate production from the lost and damaged platforms was approximately 10 Mbbls of oil per day and 21 MMcf of gas per day. All of these platforms are expected to be abandoned over the next three years and the Company has recorded a present value obligation of approximately $492 million to reflect the estimated abandonment costs to be incurred (See Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of Item 15 in this Form 10 K). The adjustment for abandonment obligations is recorded in our property balance and will be reflected in income as additional depletion expense over time. The impact on fourth quarter 2005 depletion expense was approximately $7 million. A portion of the obligation will be recovered through insurance proceeds. Numerous other operated offshore production platforms and onshore facilities sustained damage as a result of the storms. While not as severe as the above mentioned platforms, much of the repairs require replacing grating, handrails, and lost equipment. In addition, minor structural repairs will also be required. The Company estimates that approximately $230 million will be incurred to repair these platforms and facilities and expects nearly all of these repairs to be completed during 2006. Although the $230 million estimate may change, the Company expects to recover the majority of these costs through insurance proceeds. Insurance Coverage The Company carries property damage insurance of $250 million per event subject to a $7.5 million deductible per event, and another $100 million in aggregate for the policy year. The $250 million per event in coverage is provided through OIL, while the $100 million is provided under a separate commercial policy. The OIL policy is prorated down if total claims received by the insurer for a single 21 Table of Contents event exceed $1 billion. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was advised by OIL that total claims for Hurricane Katrina would exceed the $1 billion limit, reducing the Companys ultimate recoveries by approximately 50 percent, or $125 million. The Company was also advised that as of December 31, 2005, total estimated claims for Hurricane Rita would exceed the $1 billion limit, reducing the Companys claims for Rita by approximately 20 percent. Based on current assessments by OIL, the Company expects to recover from OIL between $225 million and $250 million for both storms combined. The Company further expects to recover the full $100 million on the commercial policy. The Company also carries business interruption insurance coverage through its commercial policy to cover deferred and lost oil and natural gas production revenues. The business interruption insurance began 60 days after occurrence of each event subject to a daily limit of $750,000 per event and an aggregate limit of $150 million. Coverage is based on current market prices and began October 28, 2005 for shut in production caused by Hurricane Katrina and November 22, 2005 for Hurricane Rita. The Company accrued claims in 2005 totaling $79 million, with the remainder of the aggregate $150 million limit available for 2006. Proceeds received from the Business Interruption Insurance are reflected in Other under Revenues and Other on the Statement of Consolidated Operations and are included in cash flows from operating activities. In response to large underwriting losses caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the insurance industry has reduced capacity for windstorm damage in the Gulf of Mexico and substantially increased premium rates. As a result, there is no assurance that Apache will be able to arrange adequate insurance to cover its Gulf of Mexico exposures at a reasonable cost when the current policies expire. Exploration and Development Activity The Company spent $3.8 billion on capital expenditures in 2005, 52 percent, or $1.3 billion more than in 2004. Expenditures for 2005 exploration and production activity accounted for 90 percent, or $3.4 billion, of capital spending, a $1.0 billion increase over 2004. The balance of 2005 capital spending, which totaled $393 million, up $254 million, was for oil and gas processing facilities and pipelines in Canada, Egypt and Australia. The Company spent $39 million on acquisitions in 2005 compared to $1.1 billion in 2004, as 2005 market conditions provided a limited number of attractive acquisition opportunities. However, in early 2006, we closed an acquisition announced in late 2005. Also, on January 17, 2006, the Company announced an agreement to purchase the Argentine operations of Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer) for $675 million. Please refer to the Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture section of this Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Acquisition expenditures typically vary year to year based on the availability of opportunities that fit Apaches overall strategy. Significant highlights in each of our core areas follow: U.S. The Company spent $1.1 billion to drill 478 wells, adding 91.9 MMBoe of reserves through extension and development activity. The Company had one of the five most active drilling programs in the Gulf of Mexico and Western Oklahoma, and one of the top 10 drilling programs in West Texas. In the Gulf Coast region, we drilled 66 Gulf of Mexico wells and 48 onshore wells with a 77 percent success rate. In the Central region, we drilled 364 wells with a 97 percent success rate. The U.S. accounted for 38 percent of our 2005 equivalent production and 42 percent of the Companys estimated proved reserves at year end 2005, down from 41 percent and 44 percent in 2004, respectively. On January 5, 2006, the Company completed its purchase of Amerada Hesss interest in eight fields located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico for $269 million. Apache estimates that these fields had proved reserves of 27 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 27 billion cubic feet of natural gas at year end 2005. For additional details regarding this transaction refer to the Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture section of this Item 7. 22 Table of Contents Canada The Company spent $1.2 billion on exploration and development in Canada, drilling 1,551 successful wells out of a total 1,674 wells, adding 104.3 MMBoe of reserves. Approximately one fourth of the wells will be brought on production during the first half of 2006 upon completion of facilities. Canada accounted for 19 percent of our 2005 equivalent production and 27 percent of the Companys estimated proved reserves at year end 2005, up from 18 percent and 25 percent in 2004, respectively. We also spent $180 million during 2005 constructing 11 new gas processing plants. Six of these plants were completed during 2005 with the remainder expected to be completed throughout 2006. We are currently only producing about 19 million gross cubic feet of natural gas per day (13 MMcf/d net) from the North Grant Lands area, which represents approximately 30 percent of our production capacity. Production is restricted because of limited processing infrastructure, including pipelines, compressors and gas plants, and regulations restricting commingling of coalbed methane zones and conventional zones. We are working with regulatory authorities and expect to resolve the commingling issue favorably during the first half of 2006. Construction of processing infrastructure is ongoing. On May 5, 2005, Apache signed a farm in agreement with ExxonMobil covering approximately 650,000 acres of undeveloped properties in the Western Canadian province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache is to drill and operate 145 new wells over a 36 month period with upside potential for further drilling. ExxonMobil will retain a 37.5 percent royalty on fee lands and 35 percent of its working interest on leasehold acreage. The agreement also allows Apache to test additional horizons on approximately 140,000 acres of property covered in the 2004 farm in agreement with ExxonMobil. The 2004 farm in agreement covered approximately 380,000 acres and stipulated drilling at least 250 wells over a two year period beginning in October of 2004. Through the end of 2005, Apache drilled 457 wells on the 2004 farm in acreage, earning 207 additional acreage sections. Egypt The Company spent $352 million on exploration and development in Egypt, adding 77.7 MMBoe of reserves. Egypt accounted for 18 percent of our 2005 equivalent production and 13 percent of the Companys estimated proved reserves at year end 2005, up from 17 percent and 12 percent in 2004, respectively. On April 5, 2005, we announced two discoveries in Egypt. The Syrah 1X wildcat, on the Companys 100 percent contractor interest Khalda Concession, tested 46.5 MMcf/d of natural gas. The Tanzanite 1X, located onshore on Apaches West Mediterranean Concession, tested 5,296 b/d and 7.4 MMcf/d. On July 5, 2005, the Company announced that the Tanzanite 2 well, on Egypts West Mediterranean Onshore Concession, tested 2,846 b/d and 640 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcf/d) of gas from the Cretaceous age Alamein Dolomite formation in the Tanzanite Field. On July 5, 2005, Apache also announced a new field oil discovery, the El Diyur 2X, on the Apache operated El Diyur Concession southwest of Egypts Western Desert. A test of the lower Bahariya formation flowed at a rate of 1,177 b/d. Apache spent $182 million during 2005 developing Qasr field facilities. Large scale gas production from the Qasr field was initiated during the third quarter of 2005. Gross natural gas production rates late in the fourth quarter of 2005 averaged 160 MMcf/d. Associated condensate production exceeded 8,000 b/d. Early in 2006, upon completion of the Tarek gas plant pipeline inter connect, gross natural gas and condensate production exceeded 200 MMcf/d and 10,000 b/d, respectively. Additionally, the field is also producing over 9,000 barrels of oil per day from a shallower formation. Since all gas plants supplied by Qasr are running at full capacity, deliverability from Qasr will be restricted until additional capacity comes on line, currently anticipated in late 2007 or early in 2008. 23 Table of Contents On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 55 percent interest in the deepwater section of Egypts West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for $413 million. The gas sales agreement (the Memorandum of Understanding for which was previously announced on December 16, 2003) for the interests was assigned to Amerada Hess as a part of that sale. Apache first announced this transaction on October 13, 2005. For additional details regarding this transaction refer to the Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture section of this Item 7. Australia The Company spent $218 million on exploration and development in Australia, adding 31.9 MMBoe of reserves. During 2005, we participated in drilling 36 wells; 26 exploration wells and 10 development wells. Australia accounted for 8 percent of our 2005 equivalent production and 9 percent of the Companys estimated proved reserves at year end 2005 compared to 10 percent and 9 percent in 2004, respectively. On June 15, 2005, Apache announced the development of its Rose gas/condensate field in Australia with the completion of the Rose 4 development well. The Rose 4 well, which is part of the Harriet Joint Venture, significantly enhances the joint ventures gas deliverability. Production will be sold into 13 dedicated contracts. On July 18, 2005, Burrup Fertilisers claimed force majeure and defaulted its take or pay obligations on a 48.2 MMcf/d gas purchase contract, net to Apache. Settlement negotiations with Burrup Fertilisers are continuing and the plant is expected to be operational in the first half of 2006, at which time gas deliveries and payments are anticipated. On July 28, 2005, Apache announced that it initiated production from the Mohave 1H discovery in the Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia. The initial gross production rate was 10,690 b/d from the Flag Sandstone zone, a prolific but traditionally often smaller reservoir. Apache owns a 68.5 percent interest in the field. On August 24, 2005, the Company announced it signed a new 15 year term contract to supply gas to a major power station to be built in Kwinana, Western Australia. The terms call for delivery of approximately 215 billion cubic feet (bcf) gross (118 bcf net to Apache) at a daily gross rate of 39 MMcf. The Company expects to source the gas for the contract from its John Brookes field beginning in late 2008. The term can be extended an additional 10 years by mutual agreement. North Sea The Company spent $489 million in the North Sea, including $198 million on facility upgrades to improve the operating efficiency of the platforms. We drilled 23 exploration and development wells during 2005 with a 65 percent success rate, adding 45.2 MMBoe of reserves. The North Sea accounted for 14 percent of our 2005 equivalent production and 9 percent of the Companys estimated proved reserves at year end 2005 compared to 12 percent and 9 percent in 2004, respectively. The Company acquired 22 North Sea blocks in the 2005 UK license bid round. Also, during 2005, Apache acquired interests in six additional North Sea blocks, one via a small acquisition and five earned through farm ins on four prospects. We had oil discoveries in three of the four farm in prospects. In 2004, Apache acquired 14 new blocks in the UK license bid round. At the end of 2005, Apache held interests in 45 North Sea blocks. During 2005, Apache shot three new 3D seismic surveys in the North Sea, and together with the purchase and reprocessing of various 3D data sets, currently have 3 D seismic coverage on 27 blocks of the total 45 Apache North Sea held blocks. 24 Table of Contents Other Our year end 2005 estimated reserves remained relatively balanced with a 46 percent oil and 54 percent natural gas mix. This compares to 48 percent oil and 52 percent natural gas at the end of 2004. Estimated proved undeveloped reserves represented 30.4 percent of total year end 2005 estimated proved reserves compared to 32.7 percent at year end 2004. Apache was challenged in 2005 by steadily increasing service costs resulting from increased demand with high commodity prices and the major Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. The increases were reflected in nearly all of our drilling and lease operating costs, including; rig rates, drill pipe costs, chemical costs and the costs of power and fuel. The Company reviews these costs for each core area on a routine basis and pursues alternatives in maintaining efficient levels of costs and expenses. While we are encouraged by the current financial outlook for 2006, we will continue to monitor costs, and depending on drilling costs relative to market prices, we may act to reduce our drilling expenditures as we did in 2001. This is particularly relevant in the U.S. where reserve targets generally continue to decrease in size. Acquisition costs also increased generally in 2005, and for that reason we were not very active during the year, completing $39 million of acquisitions. However, in early 2006, we closed an acquisition announced in late 2005. Also, on January 17, 2006, the Company announced an agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources (see Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture section in this Item 7). We believe we are well positioned to pursue future acquisitions should the appropriate opportunities arise. The Company also experienced unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements in Canada in 2005 which impacted our lease operating and drilling costs. We did see some favorable exchange rate movements in Australia and the U.K., although the favorable impact on our lease operating and drilling costs were much less than the unfavorable impact in Canada. Refer to the Costs section of this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further discussion of items impacting costs in 2005. In May 2005, the Companys stockholders approved a new targeted stock plan that provides incentives for employees to double Apaches share price to $108 by the end of 2008, with an interim goal of $81 to be achieved by the end of 2007. To achieve the trigger price, the Companys stock price must close at or above the stated threshold for 10 days out of any 30 consecutive trading days by the end of the stated period. Under the plan, if the first threshold is achieved, approximately 1.3 million shares would be awarded for an intrinsic cost of $106 million. Achieving the second threshold would result in approximately 2.0 million shares awarded for an intrinsic cost of $213 million. In July 2004, the Company signed an amendment agreement with the EGPC which, among other things, extended the term of the Khalda, Khalda West and Salam development leases through 2024. These development leases would have expired in 2011, 2012 and 2010, respectively. Apache also received a five year extension on the Khalda Offset exploration acreage with an option for an additional three year extension. As part of this agreement and in conjunction with the Qasr 25 year Gas Sales Agreement signed in April 2004, we agreed to re price natural gas volumes in excess of 100 MMcf/d produced from the Khalda Concession development leases and future Khalda Offset development leases. Under the new pricing formula, Apache receives a price indexed to crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu. Pricing for the first 100 MMcf/d remains subject to the original contract price (which is indexed to oil pricing, but without a minimum or maximum) until January 1, 2013, at which time all Khalda area gas will be priced under the new pricing formula. For 2005 and 2004, Apaches prices, which were a blend of the old and new contracts, averaged $4.59 per Mcf and $4.35 per Mcf, respectively. Results of Operations This section includes a discussion of our 2005 and 2004 results of operations and provides insight into unique events and circumstances for each of the Companys six reportable segments. Apaches geographic segments include the United States, Canada, Egypt, Australia, the North Sea and Other International. These segments are primarily in the business of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Please refer to Note 13, Business Segment Information of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for segment information. 25 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Divestitures Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture Amerada Hess On January 5, 2006, the Company completed its purchase of Amerada Hesss interest in eight fields located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico for $269 million. Apache estimates that these fields had proved reserves of 27 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 27 billion cubic feet of natural gas as of year end 2005. The Company had previously announced on October 13, 2005 that it had agreed to purchase Amerada Hesss interest for $404 million. The price and number of properties involved in this transaction were reduced as a result of third parties exercising their preferential rights. On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 55 percent interest in the deepwater section of Egypts West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for $413 million. Apache did not have any oil and gas reserves recorded for these properties. Apache first announced this transaction on October 13, 2005. Pioneer Natural Resources On January 17, 2006, we announced plans to increase greatly our holdings in Argentina by agreeing to buy Pioneers Argentina operations. The transaction includes interest in 36 separate blocks on approximately 1.8 million gross acres located in the Neuquen, Austral and San Jorge Basins. On January 1, 2006, the properties were producing approximately 9,000 barrels of liquids and 120 MMcf of natural gas per day. The Pioneer transaction is expected to close in late March 2006. 2005 Acquisitions During 2005, Apache completed acquisitions for $39 million, adding approximately 7.8 MMboe to the Companys proved reserves. On May 5, 2005, Apache signed a farm in agreement with Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) covering approximately 650,000 acres of undeveloped properties in the Western Canadian province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache is to drill and operate 145 new wells over a 36 month period with upside potential for further drilling. ExxonMobil will retain a 37.5 percent royalty on fee lands and 35 percent of its working interest on leasehold acreage. The agreement also allows Apache to test additional horizons on approximately 140,000 acres of property covered in the 2004 farm in agreement with ExxonMobil. 2004 Acquisitions ExxonMobil During the third quarter of 2004, Apache entered into separate arrangements with ExxonMobil that provided for property transfers and joint operating and exploration activity across a broad range of prospective and mature properties in (1) Western Canada, (2) West Texas and New Mexico, and (3) onshore Louisiana and on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf. Apaches participation included cash payments of approximately $347 million, subject to normal post closing adjustments. The following summarizes these transactions: ExxonMobil Western Canada In August 2004, Apache signed a farm in agreement with ExxonMobil covering approximately 380,000 gross acres of undeveloped properties in the Western Canadian Province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache has the right to earn acreage sections by drilling an initial well on each such section. By drilling at least 250 wells during the initial two year earning period under the agreement, Apache will receive a one year extension in which to earn additional sections. As to any sections earned by Apache, ExxonMobil will retain a 37.5 percent royalty on fee lands and 35 percent of its working interest on leasehold acreage. Under certain circumstances, ExxonMobil has the right to convert its retained 35 percent working interest into a 12.5 percent overriding royalty. In addition, during the terms of this agreement, Apache is required to carry ExxonMobils retained working interest with respect to certain drilling, capping, completion, equipping and tie in costs associated with wells drilled on leasehold acreage. 26 Table of Contents ExxonMobil West Texas and New Mexico In September 2004, Apache acquired interests from ExxonMobil in 23 mature producing oil and gas fields in West Texas and New Mexico for $318 million. Apache separately contributed approximately $29 million into a partnership to obtain additional interests in the properties. ExxonMobil will retain interests in the properties through the partnership, including the right to receive, on certain fields, 60 percent of the oil proceeds above $30 per barrel in 2004, $29 per barrel in 2005 and $28 per barrel during the period from 2006 thru 2009. ExxonMobil Louisiana and Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Also in September 2004, Apache and ExxonMobil entered into joint exploration agreements to explore Apaches acreage in South Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf. The agreements provide for an initial term of five years, with the potential for an additional five years based on expenditures by ExxonMobil. Pursuant to the agreement covering South Louisiana, Apache leased 50 percent of its interests below certain producing or productive formations in the acreage to ExxonMobil, subject to retention of a 20 percent royalty interest. Pursuant to the agreement covering the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf, no assignments will be made until a prospect has been proposed and the initial well has been drilled. Apache will retain all rights in each prospect above certain producing or productive formations and further will retain a three percent overriding royalty interest in any property assigned to ExxonMobil. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a complete discussion of those transactions. Anadarko On August 20, 2004, Apache signed a definitive agreement to acquire all of Anadarkos Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf properties (excluding certain deepwater properties) for $537 million, subject to normal post closing adjustments, including preferential rights. The transaction was effective as of October 1, 2004, and included interests in 74 fields covering 232 offshore blocks (approximately 664,000 acres) and 104 platforms. Eighty nine of the blocks were undeveloped at the time of the acquisition. Apache operates 49 of the fields comprising approximately 70 percent of the production. Prior to Apaches purchase from Anadarko, Morgan Stanley paid Anadarko $646 million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in these properties. Anadarkos sale of an overriding royalty interest to Morgan Stanley is commonly known in the industry as a volumetric production payment (VPP), the obligations of which Apache assumed along with its subsequent purchase. Under the terms of the VPP, Morgan Stanley is to receive a fixed volume of oil and natural gas production (20 MMboe) over four years beginning in October 2004. The VPP represents a non operating interest in the properties that is free of all costs of operations and production. Morgan Stanley is entitled to first production and may receive up to 90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by the VPP in any given month to satisfy these deliverables. However, Morgan Stanley has no right to look to other assets or production of Apache. The VPP is scheduled to terminate on August 31, 2008, but may be extended if all scheduled VPP volumes have not been delivered to Morgan Stanley and the properties are still producing. The VPP includes restrictions on the Companys ability to sell the properties subject to the VPP or resign as operator of VPP properties it currently operates. Upon termination of the VPP, all rights, titles and interests revert back to Apache. Apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the VPP. The strategic rationale for Apache buying these assets burdened by a volumetric production payment is several fold. First, because Morgan Stanley gets their production first and Apache receives the remainder, Morgan Stanley is paying substantially more per boe, thereby significantly reducing Apaches cost per unit. Second, although Morgan Stanleys priority call on production leaves Apache with more risk, in exchange we retain all the upside associated with finding more reserves on the acquired properties than anticipated at the time of the acquisition. This is a risk/reward scenario with which we are comfortable and that plays to our long history of adding value to numerous acquired properties through proactive operations. Third, our experience is that invariably we earn higher rates of return from drilling and related activities than we do from acquisitions, yet acquisitions bring an inventory of drilling and exploitation opportunities. Because Morgan Stanley paid Anadarko more than Apache for proved reserves, a higher percentage of Apaches investment will be concentrated in the higher risk, but generally higher reward, future drilling activity. As a final note, Morgan Stanley, while having less risk, is not risk free. In the event that the properties purchased by Apache are 27 Table of Contents insufficient to deliver the volumes sold to Morgan Stanley, there is no recourse to any properties other than those acquired from Anadarko. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this Item 7 for further discussion of VPPs. The $537 million purchase price agreed to in the definitive agreement was subsequently adjusted for the exercise of preferential rights by third parties and other normal post closing adjustments. After adjusting for these items, Apache paid $532 million for the properties and recorded estimated proved reserves of 60 MMboe, of which 50 percent is natural gas. In addition, an $84 million liability for the future cost to produce and deliver the VPP volumes was recorded by the Company. This liability will be settled through a reduction of lease operating expense as the volumes are produced and delivered to Morgan Stanley. Apache also recorded abandonment obligations for the properties of approximately $134 million and other obligations assumed from Anadarko in the amount of $27 million. Apache allocated $122 million of the purchase price to unproved property. The purchase price was funded by borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program. We routinely evaluate our property portfolio and divest those that are marginal or no longer fit into our strategic growth program. We divested $80 million, $4 million and $59 million of properties during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Given the current tightly balanced supply demand market, small variations in either supply or demand, or both, can have dramatic effects on prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while other economic factors could impact demand. Oil and Natural Gas Prices While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a world wide market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions. However, throughout 2005, the price differentials related to crude oil qualities were volatile, and the prices we received for our North American sour crude oil compared to the NYMEX Domestic Sweet index widened beyond historical averages. This price differential was exacerbated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita which caused extensive damage to the refining complex along the U.S. Gulf Coast. These quality differentials, which impacted approximately one third of our U.S. production, occurred largely because OPEC produced more sour crude to satisfy rising world demand, while U.S. sour crude refining capacity was hindered by the damage caused by the hurricanes. This excess in sour crude supply over the refining capacity created competition among producers driving a deeper discount for sour crude. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the sweet to sour crude oil quality differential averaged $6.50 per barrel. Apache primarily sells its natural gas into three markets: 1) North America, which has a common market and where supply and demand are currently tightly balanced, creating a volatile pricing environment; 2) Australia, which has a local market with limited demand relative to available supply and long term fixed price contracts; and 3) Egypt, which has a local market where the price received for our production is indexed to a weighted average Dated Brent crude oil price, a portion of which is subject to a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu. 28 Table of Contents The current outlook for 2006 indicates that the sour crude quality differentials, while narrowing somewhat, will remain above historical averages.

For the reasons discussed in the Oil and Natural Gas Prices section above, contributions to oil revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately. The following table presents each segments oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues, respectively. Oil Revenues Gas Revenues For the Year Ended For the Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 United States 26 % 32 % 33 % 54 % 58 % 62 % Canada 10 % 12 % 13 % 34 % 29 % 27 % North America 36 % 44 % 46 % 88 % 87 % 89 % Egypt 25 % 24 % 23 % 9 % 10 % 8 % Australia 7 % 13 % 16 % 3 % 3 % 3 % North Sea 29 % 16 % 13 % Other International 3 % 3 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Crude Oil Contribution In 2005, oil revenue contributions from outside the U.S. rose six percent to 74 percent ($3.3 billion) of our total 2005 consolidated oil revenues. Production growth and significantly higher price realizations drove the North Seas oil revenue contributions to 29 percent of consolidated oil revenues and were largely responsible for the growth of non U.S. oil revenues. In 2004, the North Seas contribution totaled 16 percent. U.S. oil revenues, which have historically been the predominate contributor, made up 26 percent of 2005 oil revenues, partly a consequence of the U.S. hurricanes (including Hurricane Ivan whose effects were felt in 2005) which reduced 2005 oil revenues $221 million. Australias contribution to 2005 consolidated oil revenues fell to seven percent from 13 percent on a 39 percent decrease in production compared to 2004. In 2004, oil revenues from areas outside the U.S. rose slightly to 68 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up from 67 percent in 2003. Lack of production growth reduced the U.S. overall contribution one percent to 32 percent of consolidated oil revenues. Canadas contribution also declined one percent to 12 percent on lower relative production growth. Egypts share rose one percent to 24 percent as it saw both price gains and production growth. The North Seas contribution increased three percent on both an increase in average daily production and a full year of revenues versus nine months in 2003. Australias contribution fell three percent on lower production. 30 Table of Contents Crude Oil Revenues Crude oil revenues increased $1.4 billion, or 48 percent to $4.4 billion, in 2005 from 2004 on a $16.42 per barrel increase in average realized oil price and a one percent increase in production. All segments saw a significant increase in realized crude oil price, with the North Sea and Egypt also benefiting from production growth compared to 2004. The North Seas 2005 crude oil revenues were $798 million higher than 2004, reflecting significantly higher price realizations and a 24 percent increase in production. The higher price realizations generated additional revenues of $557 million when compared to 2004, while the higher production added $242 million. Oil price realizations in 2004 were impacted by a lower fixed price physical contract that expired in December 2004. The production growth reflects the benefits of the North Seas active drilling, workover and repair programs. U.S. crude oil revenues for 2005 increased $198 million compared to 2004. This increase was the result of a 24 percent increase in crude oil price, as production decreased two percent. The 2005 U.S. average realized price includes a $2.39 per barrel hedge loss. (See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments, of this Form 10 K.) A full year of production from the ExxonMobil and Anadarko properties, which were acquired in the second half of 2004, and successful drilling and re completion efforts partially offset natural production declines and approximately 11 Mbbls per day of downtime resulting from hurricanes. Egypt contributed additional revenues of $367 million in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a 44 percent increase in crude oil price. A six percent increase in production generated an additional $55 million of revenues. The production increase was related to drilling and recompletion activity on Egypts Western Mediterranean Concession, particularly completion of the Tanzanite 2 well and recompletion of the Tanzanite 1 well. Canadas 2005 revenues increased $79 million over 2004 on a 38 percent increase in price, which more than offset the impact of an 11 percent, or 2,806 b/d, decline in oil production. Canadas production was impacted by natural decline in the Zama, Midale, Virginia Hills and Consort operated areas, as well as natural decline on non operated Karr Simonette and Nevis areas. Chinas 2005 revenues were $40 million higher than 2004 on a 35 percent increase in crude oil price and a seven percent increase in net volumes. The higher realized price and volumes generated an additional $31 million and $9 million of revenues, respectively. Chinas 2005 production outpaced 2004 primarily because production was ramping up during the first half of 2004. Australias 2005 crude oil revenues were $63 million less than 2004. This decrease reflects a 39 percent decline in production resulting from natural decline, particularly in the Legendre field, and loss of liquids from East Spar, which ceased production early in 2005. These declines were partially offset by a 37 percent increase in realized price and a full year of production from the Mohave and Artreus fields, which commenced production during the third quarter of 2005. Apache manages a small portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices using financial derivatives. Approximately six percent of our worldwide crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedging for 2005 compared to four percent in 2004. (See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments, of this Form 10 K for a summary of the current derivative positions and terms.) These financial derivative instruments reduced our 2005 and 2004 worldwide realized prices $.68 and $.21 per barrel, respectively. Natural Gas Contribution Our North America operations contributed 88 percent of 2005 consolidated natural gas revenues, up one percent from 2004. The U.S. contributed 54 percent of 2005 consolidated natural gas revenues, a four percent decline from 2004, a consequence of the U.S. hurricanes (which reduced U.S. natural gas revenues approximately $229 million). Canadas natural gas revenue contribution increased to 34 percent, reflecting both a 14 percent production growth and a slightly higher relative increase in realized price. While Egypts gas 31 Table of Contents production increased 20 percent, its contribution to 2005 gas revenues decreased slightly to nine percent as they only had marginal price improvement, a result of the new pricing formula enacted in 2004. Australias contribution to our total gas revenues was unchanged at three percent. In 2004, 87 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from North America of which 58 percent was from the U.S. and 29 percent was from Canada. The U.S. contribution decreased four percent from 2003, primarily because of production declines, the impact Hurricane Ivan had on U.S. Gulf of Mexico revenues, and the additional revenues generated by Canada and Egypt. Our U.S. Gulf Coast region, which contributed 69 percent of Apaches U.S. 2004 production, down two percent from 2003, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial production rates followed by steep declines when compared to most other U.S. producing areas. Canadas contribution was up two percent from 2003 resulting from three percent production growth and higher price gains relative to other areas. Egypts contribution to total gas revenues increased to 10 percent from eight percent in 2003, on 21 percent production growth. Australias contribution to 2004 natural gas revenues remained the same as 2003 at three percent. Natural Gas Revenues Our 2005 natural gas revenues increased $711 million from the prior year on a 29 percent increase in realized natural gas price and a two percent increase in production. The higher prices generated an additional $652 million in gas revenues, while the production increase added another $59 million to 2005 revenues, relative to the prior year. While all of our reportable segments realized increased natural gas prices, the increases in the U.S. and Canada had the most significant impact on 2005 revenues, given their price advantage and the magnitude of their volumes, relative to the other countries. Canada, Egypt and Australia also contributed increased gas revenues from higher production, while the additional price driven revenues generated in the U.S. were partially offset by an eight percent decline in production. 2005 U.S. natural gas revenues were $286 million higher than 2004. U.S. natural gas prices, which were up 32 percent, contributed $420 million of additional revenues, while an eight percent production decline lowered revenues $134 million when compared to 2004. While U.S. production was down year over year because of the hurricanes in our Gulf Coast region, an 11 percent gain in the Central region offset some of the hurricane impact. The Central region was up on active drilling and recompletion programs and acquisitions. Canadas 2005 natural gas revenues increased $356 million from 2004. Two thirds of the increase related to a 38 percent increase in price, with the balance generated by a 14 percent increase in production. Production increased 45 MMcf/d, a result of successful drilling efforts at the Nevis, Zama, Hatton and Consort areas and the ExxonMobil acreage, which more than offset natural declines in the Ladyfern and other Northeast British Columbia areas. Egypt contributed an additional $58 million to 2005 consolidated natural gas revenues compared to 2004. This increase is attributable to a six percent price improvement and a 20 percent increase in production. The year over year production growth came from development of the Khalda Concession Imhoptep and Atoun wells, development of the Qasr field, and first sales from the Northeast Abu Gharadig concession, which commenced in January 2005. Australias 2005 natural gas revenues were $6 million higher than 2004. While Australias natural gas production and price were each up four percent over 2004, the impact on revenues was minimal given the relatively low natural gas price. The additional production was attributable to the Rose, John Brookes and Bambra fields. Our 2004 natural gas revenues increased $171 million with a $.30 per Mcf increase in our average natural gas price realizations generating an additional $133 million of revenues. Higher production added the remaining $38 million. While all of our operating segments reported an increase in natural gas price realizations, most of the additional revenues attributable to price came from the U.S. and Canada. The additional revenues attributable to production were primarily generated in Egypt, where natural gas production increased 21 percent, reflecting the success of our drilling program. Canada and Australia also contributed to the increase in production revenues with production growth of three percent and six percent, respectively. 32 Table of Contents Canadas increase is from new wells while Australias increase was driven by higher customer demand and new contractual sales. Partially offsetting these additional production revenues was a three percent decrease in U.S. production. The lower U.S. production was focused in the Gulf Coast region and is related to the impact of Hurricane Ivan and natural decline in mature fields. Apache uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, including fixed price physical contracts and derivatives. The majority of our worldwide gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing market prices; however, during 2005 and 2004, approximately ten percent and nine percent of our U.S. natural gas production, respectively, was subject to long term, fixed price physical contracts. The long term, fixed price physical contracts apply to a small portion of our future U.S. natural gas production and provide a measure of protection to the Company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices. These fixed priced contracts reduced our 2005 and 2004 worldwide realized natural gas prices by $.19 per Mcf and $.10 per Mcf, respectively. Additionally, nearly all of our Australian natural gas production is subject to long term, fixed price supply contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in Australias consumer price index. Since these contracts are denominated in Australian dollars, the resulting revenues are impacted by changes in the value of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Approximately nine percent and 16 percent of our worldwide natural gas production was subject to financial derivative hedges for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Currently, all of our natural gas derivative positions have been designated against Gulf of Mexico production. These derivative financial instruments reduced our 2005 and 2004 consolidated realized prices $.15 per Mcf and $.20 per Mcf, respectively. (See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a summary of current derivative positions and terms.) Also during 2004, we amortized specific unrealized gains and losses related to derivative positions closed in October and November 2001. This amortization, which terminated in July 2004, had a negligible impact on 2005 average realized prices. Costs The tables below compare our costs on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference either expenses on a boe basis or expenses on an absolute dollar basis, or both, depending on their relevance. Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) (Per boe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment $ 1,325 $ 1,149 $ 1,003 $ 7.99 $ 7.01 $ 6.59 Other assets 91 73 70 .55 .44 .46 Asset retirement obligation accretion 54 46 38 .32 .28 .25 International impairments 13 .08 Lease operating costs 1,041 864 700 6.27 5.27 4.59 Gathering and transportation costs 100 82 60 .60 .50 .40 Severance and other taxes 453 94 122 2.73 .57 .80 General and administrative expenses 198 173 138 1.20 1.06 .91 China litigation 71 .43 Financing costs, net 116 117 115 .70 .71 .75 Total $ 3,378 $ 2,669 $ 2,259 $ 20.36 $ 16.27 $ 14.83 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Apaches Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) of oil and gas properties is calculated using the Units of Production Method (UOP). The UOP calculation in simplest terms multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter times the costs of those reserves. The result is to recognize expense at the same pace that the reservoirs are actually depleting. The costs in the UOP calculation include both the net capitalized amounts on the balance sheet, and the estimated future costs to 33 Table of Contents access and develop reserves needing additional facilities, equipment or downhole work in order to produce. Under the full cost method of accounting, the DD&A calculation is prepared separately for each country in which Apache operates. Absolute DD&A determines the expense reported each period, while the cost per unit of production (DD&A rate) provides insight into the overall costs of the companys reserves growth. Current costs incurred to drill or acquire additional reserves that are higher than the historical cost level raises the overall DD&A rate. Conversely, if reserves are added in the current period at a rate per unit less than existing levels, they average down the companys DD&A rate. Changes from period to period in absolute DD&A expense are determined by production levels, the mix of production (high cost country versus a low cost country) and the impact of recent spending (higher or lower DD&A rates). Our 2005 full cost DD&A expense totaled $1.3 billion, $176 million more than 2004. Our 2005 full cost DD&A rate of $7.99 per boe was $.98 per boe more than 2004, driven by rising industry wide drilling costs, especially in the U.S., Canada, the North Sea and Egypt. The higher commodity prices experienced over the past year, as well as the affect of the U.S. hurricanes, led to increased demand for drilling services and thus higher current drilling costs and higher estimated future development costs. The increase in North Seas rates per boe also reflects the continuation of facility upgrades to increase the overall efficiency of the platforms. Full cost DD&A expense of $1.1 billion in 2004, increased $146 million compared to 2003. Approximately 59 percent of the increase in absolute costs was related to higher production levels, mainly in the North Sea, Egypt and China. The balance was primarily attributable to higher drilling costs, as our 2004 DD&A rate increased $.42 to $7.01 per boe. The increase in per unit costs is primarily attributable to our North American operations where high commodity prices have led to increased demand for drilling services and thus higher drilling costs. A full years production from China, which carries the second highest DD&A rate in the Company, also contributed to the increase in the worldwide rate. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the DD&A rate in Egypt from a successful exploration and development program which added significant reserves through drilling at lower costs. Depreciation of other assets increased $18 million in 2005, reflecting new infrastructure built in Canada to accommodate development on acreage acquired from ExxonMobil in 2004 and new Qasr natural gas facilities in Egypt. Depreciation of other assets increased $3 million in 2004, in line with our overall growth. Impairments We assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of acreage. When an impairment occurs, costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. Impairments in international areas without proved reserves are charged to earnings upon determination that impairment has occurred. In 2003, we impaired the final $13 million ($8 million after tax) of unproved property costs in Poland. Goodwill is subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment. Goodwill totaled $189 million on December 31, 2005, and no impairment was recorded in 2005, 2004 or 2003. For further discussion, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Lease Operating Costs Lease operating costs (LOE) are generally comprised of several components: direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, workover costs and ad valorem taxes. LOE is driven in part by the type of commodity produced, the level of workover activity and the geographical location of the properties. Oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote plants and facilities. Workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy enabling us to exploit our existing reserve base by accelerating production and taking advantage of high commodity prices. Commodity prices and exchange rates also impact LOE. Historically, electricity, fuel and other service costs have risen in high commodity price environments, leading to an increase in industry wide LOE. Rising per 34 Table of Contents unit operating costs remained a challenge in 2005, especially in North America. The Company reviews production costs in each of its core areas on a monthly basis and pursues alternatives to maintain efficient levels of costs. Fluctuations in exchange rates also impact the Companys LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding to per unit costs and a stronger U.S. dollar lowering per unit costs. The U.S. dollar, which weakened against the Canadian dollar throughout 2005, strengthened marginally against the Australian dollar and British pound. Acquisitions increase absolute LOE costs, but they do not necessarily increase per unit costs or reduce margins. The following discussion will focus on per unit operating costs as this is the most informative method of analyzing LOE trends. On a per unit/boe produced basis, 2005 LOE averaged $6.27 per boe, $1.00 per boe higher than 2004. Production shut ins and additional insurance costs associated with the 2005 hurricanes added $.41 to the 2005 rate. The remaining increase reflects higher service costs associated with rising commodity prices and the associated increase in demand for services, an increase in workover activity, higher repair and maintenance costs and the impact a weaker U.S. dollar had on Canadian LOE. The slight strengthening against the Australian dollar and British pound had less impact on LOE. Regionally, 2005 costs were up as follows: U.S. The U.S. added $.77 per boe to the 2005 consolidated rate with nearly one third of the impact attributed to the additional insurance costs and production shut ins caused by the 2005 hurricanes. Higher contract labor costs, workover activity, repair and maintenance, and various other commodity price driven service costs accounted for the remaining impact. Australia Australia added $.15 per boe to the 2005 consolidated rate on a 20 percent drop in equivalent production. Australia also saw a rise in insurance cost. The lower production added $.13 per boe to the 2005 consolidated rate, while additional costs added $.02 per boe. Canada Canada added $.21 per boe to the 2005 consolidated rate increase, with costs adding $.27 per boe, partially offset by the impact of higher volumes, which reduced the rate $.06 per boe. 2005 costs were up $44 million from 2004, with 42 percent attributable to the strengthening Canadian dollar. The balance related to various other costs associated with an increase in activity and the general rise in costs, including higher contract labor, power and fuel, repair and maintenance and workover costs. Egypt Egypts 2005 costs were $23 million higher than 2004 on higher diesel fuel costs, an increase in workover activity, higher labor costs and insurance costs. The diesel fuel costs were previously subsidized by the Egyptian government. Egypt added $.04 per boe to the consolidated rate increase, with higher costs adding $.14 per boe and increased volumes lowering the rate $.10 per boe. North Sea The North Sea reduced the 2005 consolidated rate $.16 per boe on a 24 percent increase in production, partially offset by a two percent increase in costs. North Sea costs were up on increased repair and maintenance activity. On a per unit produced basis, 2004 LOE increased $.68 to $5.27 per boe. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in industry wide service costs in North America with higher commodity prices, an increase in currency exchange rates in Canada, the North Sea and Australia, and higher expense resulting from our incentive programs, primarily stock based programs which we began expensing in 2003. Per unit costs were also negatively impacted by the combined impact of lost production and additional costs related to Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico and higher repair and maintenance costs in Australia. These increases offset the impact of a $2.75 decline in the unit cost in the North Sea, where our investments to increase production (and lower operating costs per unit) over the long term began to pay off. Gathering and Transportation Costs Apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two types of agreements, typical in our industry. Both types of agreements include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which Apache sells oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collects a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. In this case, the Company records sales at the price received from the purchaser, which is net of transportation costs. 35 Table of Contents Under the other arrangement, Apache sells oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pays transportation to a third party carrier and receives from the purchaser a price with no transportation deduction. In this case, the Company records the transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. The Companys treatment of transportation costs is pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs and as a result a portion of our transporting costs is reflected in sales prices and a portion is reflected as Gathering and Transportation Costs rendering the separately identified transportation costs incomplete. In both the U.S. and Canada, Apache sells oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, Apache pays transportation to a third party carrier and receives a purchase price with no transportation deduction. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In China, we incur costs for barges to transport crude oil to onshore terminal facilities. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production has historically been sold to EGPC under netback arrangements. During 2005, Apache exported a portion of its Egyptian crude oil under both types of arrangements. Future export cargoes may be sold under netback arrangements or Apache may arrange shipping and receive prices without transportation deductions. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs paid directly by Apache to third party carriers for each of the periods presented. For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) U.S. $ 30 $ 28 $ 21 Canada 33 31 28 North Sea 28 22 11 Egypt 8 China 1 1 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 100 $ 82 $ 60 These costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our North American operations, North Sea crude oil sales and Egyptian crude oil exports. The 22 percent increase in costs for 2005 was driven primarily by North Seas production growth and Egyptian crude exports. Apache began exporting Egyptian crude in the second half of 2004 and first incurred third party transportation charges in early 2005. Transportation costs in 2004 increased 37 percent from 2003 primarily because of production growth and a full year of production in the North Sea and an increase in volumes transported under third party transportation contracts in the U.S., Canadas 2004 costs were 11 percent higher than 2003 because of an increase in third party transportation rates and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes are primarily comprised of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending) from subject fields in the U.K. North Sea. We are also subject to the Australian Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), and various Canadian taxes including the Canadian Large Corporation Tax, Saskatchewan Capital 36 Table of Contents Tax, Saskatchewan Resource Surtax and Freehold Mineral Tax. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses. For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Severance taxes $ 139 $ 127 $ 77 U.K. PRT 285 (61 ) 20 Canadian taxes 22 23 20 Other 7 5 5 Total Severance and Other Taxes $ 453 $ 94 $ 122 Severance and other taxes totaled $453 million in 2005, $359 million greater than 2004. The U.K. PRT increased $346 million in 2005 on significantly higher oil price realizations and higher production. U.S. severance taxes increased $36 million on higher oil and gas prices. Australias severance taxes decreased $24 million, reflecting lower excise tax on production from Legendre, a result of declining production. In 2004, severance and other taxes decreased 23 percent, or $28 million, with severance taxes representing the majority of these taxes. U.S. severance and other taxes increased $15 million, in line with higher production revenues. Australias taxes increased $36 million as production from the Legendre field crossed a cumulative threshold, triggering an excise tax. In 2004 Apaches U.K. PRT was in a credit position as deductible capital spending exceeded taxable cash flows from the North Sea Forties field. Canadian taxes increased $3 million on an increase in Freehold Mineral Taxes. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses (G&A) of $1.20 per boe for 2005 increased $.14 per boe over 2004. Absolute costs increased $25 million or 14 percent. Nearly three fourths of the increase in year over year costs related to the impact of Apaches stock based compensation programs. Stock based compensation costs increased relative to the prior year because of new stock option grants issued in 2005, a new targeted stock plan approved by stockholders in May 2005, and the impact Apaches rising common stock price had on stock based compensation expense. The balance of the G&A increase was primarily attributed to the increased cost of insurance, a consequence of the hurricanes, higher charitable contributions and higher Sarbanes Oxley compliance audit fees. G&A of $1.06 per boe in 2004 increased $.15 per boe over 2003. Absolute costs increased $35 million, or 25 percent. Over $21 million, or 61 percent, of the additional expense was related to the impact Apaches rising stock price had on stock based compensation programs and incremental incentive compensation. The impact from the higher stock price stems from Apaches decision, effective January 1, 2003, to expense stock based compensation plans (see Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 in this Form 10 K). Approximately $3 million, or 8 percent, of the increase is related to our North Sea operations, with the first full year of operations in 2004. The balance of the increase was related to higher audit and tax fees, increased insurance premiums, and expansion of the Companys gas marketing group. Financing Costs, Net The major components of financing costs, net, include interest expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs for 2005 were slightly lower than 2004. While gross interest expense increased $7 million in 2005 on a higher average debt balance, it was mostly offset by a $6 million increase in the amount of interest capitalized, a result of a higher average unproved property balance. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2005 was 6.7 percent and 2004 was 6.1 percent. 2004 net financing costs were slightly higher than 2003. Gross interest expense decreased $1 million in 2004, a result of a lower average debt balance. This decrease was offset by a $2 million decrease in the amount 37 Table of Contents of interest capitalized, a result of a lower average unproved property balance. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2004 was 6.1 percent compared to 6.4 percent on December 31, 2003. Provision for Income Taxes 2005 income tax expense of $1.6 billion was $590 million higher than 2004. The additional income tax expense was driven by higher taxable income related to the increased oil and gas revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. Our effective tax rate was 37.62 percent in 2005 compared to 37.29 percent in 2004. Currency fluctuations added $13 million of additional deferred tax expense to 2005 and $58 million to 2004. Income tax expense in 2004 of $993 million was $166 million or 20 percent higher than 2003. The higher taxes were primarily associated with higher income driven by higher oil and gas production revenues in 2004 compared to 2003. Our effective tax rate was 37.29 percent in 2004 compared to 43.02 percent in 2003. The 2003 effective tax rate included $172 million of additional deferred tax expense because of currency fluctuations compared to $58 million in 2004. For a discussion of Apaches sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations, please refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Foreign Currency Risk of this Form 10 K. Capital Resources and Liquidity Financial Indicators At December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Millions of dollars except as indicated Current ratio .99 1.05 1.10 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,332 $ 3,232 $ 2,706 Total debt 2,192 2,588 2,327 Shareholders equity 10,541 8,204 6,533 Percent of total debt to capitalization 17 % 24 % 26 % Floating rate debt/total debt 15 % 6 % Overview Apaches primary uses of cash are exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs and expenses necessary to maintain continued operations, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will shrink. Cash investments are continuously required to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves. See Item 1 and 2, Business and Properties, Risks Factors, in this Form 10 K. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on having adequate capital resources available, on our success in both exploration and development activities and on acquiring additional reserves. Our year end reserve life index indicates an average decline of 7.8 percent per year. This projection is based on prices at year end, except in those instances where future natural gas and oil sales are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or lower prices, estimates of investments required to develop estimated proved undeveloped reserves, costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in Note 14, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through net cash provided by operating activities (cash flow) and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flow. Our cash flow, both in the short and long term, is impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, we only forecast, for internal use by management, an annual 38 Table of Contents cash flow. Longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are not used by management to operate our business. The annual cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to the adjusted cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs. The Company has historically utilized internally generated cash flow, committed and uncommitted credit facilities and access to both debt and equity capital markets for all other liquidity and capital resources needs. Apaches ability to access the debt capital market is supported by its investment grade credit ratings. Because of the liquidity and capital resources alternatives available to Apache, including internally generated cash flows, Apaches management believes that its short term and long term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including its capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Apaches senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by Moodys, Standard and Poors and Fitch with ratings of A3, A and A, respectively. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was .99 on December 31, 2005 compared to 1.05 at the end of 2004. Current liabilities increased 70 percent ($904 million) in 2005 versus a 60 percent ($813 million) increase in current assets. While virtually all meaningful current asset and current liability categories increased in 2005, changes in the North Sea PRT liability, our current portion of derivative liabilities, and current ARO liabilities particularly impacted the ratio. The North Sea PRT liability, which is a component of Other current liabilities, increased approximately $171 million compared to the prior year. The current portion of FMV of derivatives increased nearly $235 million, which is eleven times the 2004 amount. Both the PRT and derivative liabilities reflect the impact of higher commodity prices. The current ARO liability of $94 million was established in 2005 because of damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Collectively, the increases in liabilities more than offset the higher current asset balances. Current receivables were up $505 million, or 54 percent, most of which related to oil and gas receivables impacted by commodity prices. Cash more than doubled to $229 million. Drilling advances, up 76 percent, and prepaid assets and other, up 130 percent, were other asset categories that also increased substantially. The drilling advance amount is in line with increased drilling activity in 2005 compared to 2004. The change in prepaid assets and other relates to higher taxes and other deposits. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2005 totaled $4.3 billion, up from $3.2 billion in 2004. The increase in 2005 cash flow was attributed primarily to the significant increase in commodity prices. The Companys average realized oil and natural gas prices increased 47 percent and 29 percent, respectively; a reflection of higher worldwide commodity prices. Higher production also added to our 2005 cash flow relative to 2004, albeit to a much less extent. These increases in cash flow were partially offset by higher production costs attributable to the effect of increased commodity prices, costs related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and an increase in exchange rates in Canada. The Company reviews production costs for each core area on a monthly basis and pursues alternatives in maintaining efficient levels of costs and expenses. For a more detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, costs and expenses, please refer to the Results of Operations section of this Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2004 totaled $3.2 billion, up from $2.7 billion in 2003. The increase in 2004 cash flow was primarily attributed to the significant increase in commodity prices. The Companys averaged realized oil and natural gas prices increased 27 and 7 percent, respectively; a reflection of higher worldwide commodity prices. Higher production also increased our 2004 cash flow on a 13 percent and one percent increase in oil and natural gas production, respectively. These increases were partially offset by higher production costs attributable to the effect of increased commodity prices, an increase in exchange rates in Canada, North Sea and Australia, costs related to Hurricane Ivan and increases in costs from our stock based employee incentive programs. 39 Table of Contents Historically, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Companys short term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Sales volume changes have also impacted cash flow in the short term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in the past. Apaches long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations. Debt During 2005, we continued to strengthen our financial flexibility and to build on the solid financial positions of previous years. We exited 2005 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 17 percent, a decrease of seven percent from year end 2004, with lower debt and increases in equity resulting from earnings. At year end 2005 the Company had long term debt of $2.2 billion, $396 million lower than year end 2004, as the Companys capital spending was less than internally generated cash flow. The Companys outstanding debt consisted of notes and debentures maturing in the years 2006 through 2096. Approximately $.3 million, $173 million, $.4 million, $100 million and $1.9 billion mature in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and thereafter, respectively. During 2005, the Company maintained its senior unsecured long term debt ratings of A3 from Moodys, A from Standard and Poors and A from Fitch. The Company has a $1.2 billion commercial paper program which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2005. The commercial paper balance of $392 million on December 31, 2004 was classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the Company had the ability and intent to refinance such amount on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under its U.S. credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was 3.03 percent in 2005 and 1.79 percent in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities was $1.5 billion. We had $229 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand on December 31, 2005, compared to $111 million on December 31, 2004. On May 12, 2005, the Company entered into a new $450 million revolving bank credit facility for the U.S., a $150 million revolving bank credit facility for Australia and a $150 million revolving bank credit facility for Canada. These new facilities replaced the Companys existing credit facilities in the same amounts which were scheduled to mature in June 2007. These new facilities are scheduled to mature on May 12, 2010. There were no changes to the Companys $750 million U.S. credit facility which matures in May 2009. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the Companys consolidated assets, which approximated $964 million on December 31, 2005. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group. There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2005. 40 Table of Contents Stock Transactions The Company periodically uses access to equity capital markets to fund significant acquisitions. On January 22, 2003, in conjunction with the BP transaction, we completed a public offering of approximately 19.8 million shares of common stock, including 2.6 million shares for the underwriters over allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million. The Company currently has no plans to access equity capital markets. On December 18, 2003, we announced that holders of our common stock approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to 430 million from 215 million in order to complete a previously announced two for one stock split. The record date for the stock split was December 31, 2003 and the additional shares were distributed on January 14, 2004. Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures The Company funded its exploration and production (E&D) capital expenditures, including Gathering, Transportation and Marketing (GTM) facilities, of $3.8 billion, $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily with internally generated cash flow of $4.3 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion. The Company uses a combination of internally generated cash flow, borrowings under the Companys lines of credit and commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund its significant acquisitions. During the three year period presented, the Company primarily used internally generated cash flow or its lines of credit and commercial paper program; which were subsequently paid down with internally generated cash flow. However, in 2003, in conjunction with the BP acquisition, the Company completed a public offering of approximately 19.8 million shares of common stock, including 2.6 million shares for the underwriters over allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million. The following table presents a summary of the Companys Capital Expenditures for each of our reportable segments for the past three years. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Exploration and Development: United States $ 1,072,040 $ 755,056 $ 417,701 Canada 1,188,096 756,912 568,856 Egypt 352,324 301,912 242,652 Australia 217,816 138,694 128,261 North Sea 489,072 362,054 60,204 Other International 48,484 26,493 35,098 $ 3,367,832 $ 2,341,121 $ 1,452,772 Capitalized Interest $ 56,988 $ 50,748 $ 52,891 Gas Gathering Transmission and Processing Facilities $ 392,872 $ 138,738 $ 38,533 Acquisitions: Oil and gas properties $ 39,228 $ 1,063,851 $ 1,568,106 Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities 5,484 $ 39,228 $ 1,063,851 $ 1,573,590 The Company completed its most active year to date, drilling 2,383 wells throughout 2005 and spending nearly $400 million on oil and gas processing facilities and pipelines. Approximately two thirds of our 2005 exploration and development expenditures were invested in Canada and the U.S., where nearly 69 percent of Apaches 2005 year end estimated proved reserves reside. Once again, Canada was our most active region, drilling 1,674 wells with a 93 percent success rate. Approximately 82 percent of Canadas 2005 wells were shallow development wells. Canada was also very active in the North Grant Lands, undeveloped acreage Apache obtained through two farm in agreements with ExxonMobil. Canada spent nearly $180 million 41 Table of Contents constructing 11 gas processing plants, six of which were completed by the end of 2005. In the Gulf Coast region, even with the disruptions caused by the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, we drilled 114 wells, including 66 offshore. Seventy seven percent of our Gulf Coast wells were productive. Our focus in the Gulf Coast region remained the same as 2004, development and exploitation of our existing asset base including the Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from Anadarko in the second half of 2004. The Central region was the second most active region, drilling 364 wells, with a 97 percent success rate. In the North Sea, we drilled a total of 23 wells, 18 Forties Field wells, and invested approximately $198 million of maintenance capital to continue to improve the operating efficiency of the Forties Field. We expect to complete the Forties power generation and gas ring by the summer of 2006, which will greatly reduce fuel oil generating costs and improve production reliability. In Egypt, we had another active and successful exploration and development program, drilling 121 wells of which 86 percent were productive. We also continued development of the Qasr field, where gross production average 128 MMcf/d in December 2005. In Australia, we participated in drilling 36 wells; 26 exploration wells and 10 development wells. Chinas capital expenditures were flat compared to 2004 as they continued their development drilling program. The Company spent $39 million on acquisitions in 2005 compared to $1.1 billion in 2004, as the high price commodity market in 2005 limited the number of attractive acquisition opportunities. Those that were pursued were slated to close in the first quarter of 2006. Acquisition expenditures typically vary year to year based on the availability of opportunities that fit Apaches overall strategy. In 2004, Apache drilled 1,735 wells and completed two significant acquisitions. In the Gulf of Mexico, the majority of our activity focused in and around our existing asset base, including continued exploitation of the properties purchased from BP and Shell in 2003 and the Anadarko properties purchased in 2004. In the Central region, where Apache got its start, estimated proved reserves increased 20 percent in 2004 through a combination of the ExxonMobil acquisition and an active drilling year, completing 268 of 283 wells in the region. Canada was our most active area in 2004 with over 1,300 wells drilled, three fourths of which were shallow development wells, with over 92 percent completed as producers. At the Forties Field, an experienced workforce began tackling projects to extend the life of the largest field discovered in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. Production increases at Forties the anchor of Apaches newest core area were driven by Apaches first drilling program since acquiring the field and a maintenance program aimed at improving efficiency of the field. During 2004, Apache completed 12 of 17 wells drilled as part of a $362 million capital program, including $150 million of maintenance and operations capital expenditures. In Egypt and Australia, Apache continued its successful exploration programs with several new discoveries. Our continuing development program in Egypt increased gross production to over 100,000 b/d for the first time. Capital expenditures in China decreased in 2004 with the completion of production facilities and first production in the second half of 2003. In 2004, Apache added 444.7 MMboe of estimated proved reserves through acquisitions, drilling and revisions. During 2004, GTM expenditures included additional gathering system pipelines in Egypt and a gas plant expansion on Varanus Island in Australia. For 2006, we plan another active year of drilling. Because we revise our estimates of exploration and development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry conditions and results to date, accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best. However, our 2006 preliminary estimate of exploration and development capital and oil and gas processing facilities and pipelines is in excess of $3.7 billion. We generally do not project estimates for acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable; however, in early 2006 we closed an acquisition announced in late 2005. Also, on January 17, 2006, the Company announced an agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources. Please refer to the Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture section of this Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We continually look for properties which we believe will add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise. Cash Dividend Payments The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 41 consecutive years through 2005. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. Common dividends paid during 2005 rose 32 percent to $112 million, reflecting the increase 42 Table of Contents in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend 25 percent, to 10 cents per share from eight cents per share, effective with the November 2005 dividend payment. During 2005 and 2004, Apache paid a total of $6 million in dividends each year on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. See Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Common dividends paid during 2004 rose 26 percent to $85 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. Contractual Obligations We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations. Note Contractual Obligations Reference Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter (In thousands) Debt Note 5 $ 2,192,228 $ 274 $ 172,678 $ 353 $ 99,733 $ $ 1,919,190 Operating leases and other commitments Note 10 503,724 226,410 136,070 43,026 18,736 16,421 63,061 International lease commitments Note 10 222,463 33,533 106,714 24,154 58,062 Operating costs associated with pre existing volumetric production payments on acquired properties Note 2 70,145 37,815 24,088 8,242 Total Contractual Obligations(a)(b) $ 2,988,560 $ 298,032 $ 439,550 $ 75,775 $ 176,531 $ 16,421 $ 1,982,251 (a) This table does not include the estimated liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1.5 billion. The Company records a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation. See Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further discussion. (b) This table does not include the Companys pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further discussion. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations. The Company has reserved approximately $11 million for environmental remediation. The Company has also reserved approximately $12 million for various legal liabilities, in addition to the $71 million, plus interest, we accrued for the Texaco China B.V. litigation. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies. The Company accrued approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2005, for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a member of this insurance pool which insures specific property, pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential termination 43 Table of Contents fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required. As discussed under Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, Apache assumed obligations for pre existing VPPs in the 2004 acquisition of properties from Anadarko and the 2003 acquisition of properties from Shell. Under the terms of the VPP agreements, Apache is scheduled to deliver a total of 7.8 MMboe in 2006, 4.7 MMboe in 2007 and 1.6 MMboe in 2008 to Morgan Stanley as owner of the VPP interests. Morgan Stanley is entitled to the first production and may demand up to 90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by each VPP in any given month to satisfy the VPP interests. However, they have no right to look to other assets or production of Apache. Apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the VPPs. As of December 31, 2005, Apache has booked a total of 93.5 MMboe of reserves attributable to the Anadarko and Shell transactions. The VPPs are non operating interests, free of costs incurred for operations and production. Apache provided a liability for these costs as reflected in the preceding table. Upon closing of our 2003 acquisition of the North Sea properties, Apache assumed BPs abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, did not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache fails to satisfy the abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to ensure Apaches payment of these costs, Apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moodys and Standard and Poors from the Companys current ratings of A3 and A , respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change. If Apache is required to provide a letter of credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level. The letter of credit amount would be 127 million British pounds, an amount that represents the letter of credit requirement through March 2006, and will be negotiated annually based on Apaches future abandonment obligation estimates. The Companys future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys; however, we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely. The Companys credit facilities do not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail under Capital Resources and Liquidity, Debt in this section of this Form 10 K. In addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements, Apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the Companys credit ratings decline significantly. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions. Apache entered into a partnership with ExxonMobil to obtain additional interests in specific West Texas and New Mexico oil & gas properties acquired from ExxonMobil in September 2004. As discussed in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, Apache contributed $29 million into this partnership which was determined to be a variable interest entity as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 Variable Interest Entities. Apache concluded that they were not the primary beneficiary of the partnership and, therefore, proportionately consolidated only the Companys portion of the oil and gas properties. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Full Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Operations The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful efforts method, costs such as geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred, where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties, the 44 Table of Contents successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the net book value (full cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period (ceiling limitation). If the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation, the excess amount is charged through income. We have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these finding activities. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments. Generally, the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting. Reserve Estimates Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. As such, our reserve engineers review and revise the Companys reserve estimates at least annually. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, their review covered 74, 79 and 78 percent of the reserve value, respectively. Costs Excluded Under the full cost method of accounting, oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects. Apache excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the Companys accounting, exploration and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred. Nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the Companys exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling individual wells. If geological and geophysical (G&G) costs cannot be associated with specific properties, they are included in the amortization base as incurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being 45 Table of Contents amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for that country. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play. This evaluation considers among other factors, seismic data, requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital plans, and political, economic, and market conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings. Our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. Beginning in 2001, we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and gas sales. Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in a one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. During 2005, we experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts, but our past due balance improved as of December 31, 2005. We have not established a reserve for these Egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid, albeit late, and have no indication that we will not be able to collect our receivable. Asset Retirement Obligation The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Prior to 2003, under the full cost method of accounting, as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections, the estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations, net of the value of salvage, were included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties. In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Apache adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as discussed in Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of Item 15 of this Form 10 K. SFAS No. 143 significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets (asset retirement obligations or ARO). Primarily, the new statement requires the Company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the Companys asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. As such, beginning in 2003 our depletion expense is reduced since we will deplete a discounted ARO rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted in our oil and gas property base. The lower depletion expense under SFAS No. 143 is offset, however, by accretion expense, which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing Asset Retirement Obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. 46 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in seven countries. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established, and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the Companys tax returns. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. Derivatives Apache uses derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign currency volatility. The Company accounts for the contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The estimated fair values of Apaches derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. For oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs. SFAS No. 133 requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be marked to market and reported in current period income, rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. Realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in Other under Revenues and Other of the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The fair value estimate of Apaches derivative contracts requires judgment; however, the Companys derivative contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data. Option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Commodity Risk in this Form 10 K for commodity price sensitivity information and the Companys policies related to the use of derivatives. Stock Based Compensation During 2002, Apache began modifying its stock compensation plans in order to reflect the cost of these plans in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As part of this effort, Apache began issuing stock appreciation rights and restricted stock and, effective January 1, 2003, adopted the expense provisions of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended, on a prospective basis for all stock options granted under the Companys existing option plans. Consistent with the Companys desire to reflect the ultimate cost of stock compensation plans on the income statement, Apache early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 R Share Based Payment upon the FASBs issuance of the revised statement in the fourth quarter 2004. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, all stock based compensation awards that vested during 2004 are now reflected in the Companys net income for the year. Awards that vested in prior years continue to be 47 Table of Contents reflected in the income statement under the accounting guidelines in place for the applicable year. Awards granted in future periods will be valued on the date of grant and expensed using a straight line basis over the required service period. Pro forma income statement presentations have been provided for in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K to present a comparative basis of all plans outstanding during the reported periods. The Company chose to adopt the statement under the Modified Retrospective approach as prescribed under SFAS No. 123 R. Under this approach, the Company is required to expense all options and stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the stock compensation determined on the date of grant. Had the Company not early adopted SFAS No. 123 R under this transition approach, 2004 net income would have been lower by $89 million ($56 million after tax) or $.17 per diluted share. Normally, net income would be negatively impacted by adopting SFAS No. 123 R under this transition method. However, the Companys Share Appreciation Plan, which triggered in 2004, has a fair market value based expense recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 R that is substantially less than the intrinsic value cost that would have been recorded under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. Please refer to Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a detailed description of the Share Appreciation Plan and costs associated with our stock compensation plans. Also, inherent in expensing stock options and other stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123 R are several judgments and estimates that must be made. These include determining the underlying valuation methodology for stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation, such as the Companys expected stock price volatility, expected term of the employee option, expected dividend yield, the expected risk free interest rate, the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option. Changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant. For option valuations, Apache utilizes the Black Scholes option pricing model, however, the Company does run lattice models to verify that the assumptions used are reasonable. For valuing the Share Appreciation Awards, the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation model developed by a third party. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity Risk The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly oil price realizations, including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges, ranged from a low of $42.63 per barrel to a high of $61.31 per barrel during 2005. Average gas price realizations, including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges, ranged from a monthly low of $5.16 per Mcf to a monthly high of $8.02 per Mcf during the same period. Based on the Companys 2005 worldwide oil production levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by $85 million. Based on the Companys 2005 worldwide gas production levels, a $.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by $46 million. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes do not exceed the ceiling. This ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this ceiling, the excess is charged to additional DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under 48 Table of Contents long term contracts. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities; however, as discussed above, sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As indicated in Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, the Company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with our 2003 and 2004 acquisitions. These positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high oil and gas prices and were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated production. Apache has historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions. As such, the Companys use of hedging activity remains at a correspondingly low level. In 2005, financial derivative hedges represented approximately nine percent of the total worldwide natural gas production and six percent of the total worldwide crude oil production. Heading into 2006, hedges in place are entirely related to U.S. production and will represent approximately seven percent of worldwide production for natural gas and crude oil. On December 31, 2005, the Company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of $(260) million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately $64 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately $63 million. The Company also had open crude oil derivative positions with a fair value of $(148) million. A 10 percent change in oil prices would change the fair value by plus or minus $37 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2005. See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for notional volumes and terms associated with the Companys derivative contracts. Apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Treasurer and other key members of Apaches management, approve and oversee these controls, which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit, limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Governmental Risk Apaches U.S. and international operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state and local laws and regulations impacting production levels, taxes, environmental requirements and other assessments including a potential Windfall Profits Tax. The Company anticipates that announced changes to the taxation scheme in the North Sea will impact that regions results. Primarily, the corporate tax rate in the North Sea is expected to increase 10 percent to an effective rate of 50 percent. Once the announcement is ratified, the new rate change will be effective as of January 1, 2006. Weather and Climate Risk Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged 49 Table of Contents equipment. While our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance program, and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of the weather, not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated or insured against. In response to large underwriting losses caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the insurance industry has reduced capacity for windstorm damage and substantially increased premium rates. As a result, there is no assurance that Apache will be able to arrange insurance to cover fully its Gulf of Mexico exposures at a reasonable cost when the current policies expire. Foreign Currency Risk The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts. Over half the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in Australian dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In contrast, all oil and gas production in Egypt is sold for U.S. dollars and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date. A 10 percent strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the British pound as of December 31, 2005 would result in a foreign currency net loss of approximately $128 million. This is primarily driven from foreign currency effects on the Companys deferred tax liability positions in Canada and Australia. The Company began hedging a portion of its foreign exchange risk associated with lease operating expenditures in 2004. The Companys treasury department administers this hedging program. The Company did not have any open hedging positions associated with lease operating expenditures as of December 31, 2005. For information on open derivative contracts, please see Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2005, the Company had no interest rate risk exposure since the Company did not have any floating rate debt. Forward Looking Statements and Risk Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, capital expenditure projections, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 50 Table of Contents
