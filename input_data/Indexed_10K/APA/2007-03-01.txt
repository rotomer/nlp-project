ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company whose principle business includes exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We operate in six countries: the United States, Canada, Egypt, Australia, offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea, and Argentina. In 2006, we earned $2.5 billion, within three percent of last years record earnings, despite a 19 percent decline in gas price realizations. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $4.3 billion, flat to 2005. We also set records for production and reserves with worldwide equivalent production increasing 10 percent, making 2006 the 27th out of the last 28 years that we have reported production growth. Reserves grew nine percent, increasing in every core area, marking the 21st consecutive year of reserve growth at Apache. Our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through drilling, acquisitions, or a combination of both, depending on, among other things, costs levels, potential rates of return and the availability of acquisition opportunities. We utilize a portfolio approach to provide diversity in terms of geologic risk, geographic location, hydrocarbon mix (crude oil and natural gas) and reserve life. This strategy provides multiple avenues for growth. We took several steps in 2006 to balance and grow our asset base. Outside of North America, we divested two assets: the undeveloped deepwater section of Egypts West Mediterranean Concession and our interest in the Zhao Dong block offshore the Peoples Republic of China. To rebalance our international portfolio, we bolstered our position in Argentina purchasing an estimated 109 MMboe of reserves in two separate transactions. After increasing our production on these properties through active operations, Argentina is now our newest core area and we operate an 19 attractive property base that we believe has significant upside. In the U.S., we completed two strategic purchases strengthening our Permian basin and Gulf of Mexico positions. In January 2006, we purchased an estimated 31 MMboe of proved reserves in long life producing properties in the Permian basin of West Texas. The acquisition was balanced by purchasing 44 MMboe of shorter life, but higher rate of return reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. Worldwide, we purchased an estimated 196.5 MMboe of proved reserves. On the exploration and development side, we drilled 1,611 wells with an 87 percent success rate with active drilling programs in all core areas. We invested $3.7 billion in exploration and development activities, excluding asset retirement costs and capitalized interest, adding 224 MMboe in of estimated proved reserves. Our reserve life across our core areas spans from eight to twenty years, with a 46 percent oil and 54 percent natural gas mix, consistent with yearend 2005. Apaches profitability is a function of commodity prices, the cost to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions and the cost to produce our reserves. Trends in commodity prices directly impact oil and gas revenues and demand for services and thus, have a significant impact on drilling and operating costs. We closely monitor trends in drilling costs in each of our core areas and the prices paid to acquire producing properties and, when appropriate, adjust our capital budgets. Commodity prices are driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil, spot prices applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas production and many other factors beyond our control. Historically, these prices have been volatile and unpredictable, and 2006 was no exception. Our 2006 crude oil price realizations averaged $59.92 per barrel, up 16 percent from 2005, ranging from an average monthly high of $68.59 per barrel in July to a low of $52.64 per barrel in October as demand waned in the U.S. with a delay in the onset of seasonal temperatures. Natural gas realizations were 19 percent lower than last year, averaging $5.17 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), with a high of $8.05 per Mcf in January, and a low of $3.85 per Mcf in October. A high drilling and operating cost environment once again challenged us in 2006, continuing the trend seen over the past few years. This upward trend is a reflection of increased demand driven by historically high commodity prices. In addition, repair activity from the 2005 Gulf of Mexico hurricanes also increased demand for services in the U.S., and accordingly, costs. Cost increases were reflected in nearly all of our drilling and lease operating cost components, including: rig rates, drill pipe costs, labor costs, chemical costs and the costs of power and fuel. The Company reviews costs for each core area on a routine basis and pursues alternatives in maintaining efficient levels of costs and expenses. Despite pressure from rising costs, 2006 margins, while down slightly from record 2005 levels, were the second highest in our 50 plus year history. For purposes of this discussion, margins are calculated as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands, except margin) Income before Income Taxes $ 4,009,595 $ 4,206,524 $ 2,663,083 Barrels of oil equivalent produced 182,913 165,890 164,050 Margin per boe produced $ 44.14 $ 44.95 $ 32.36 While the Company has made considerable progress recovering from the damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which struck in late August and late September 2005, the hurricanes had considerable impact on both 2006 and 2005 operations and results, and will impact 2007 operations. In addition to extensive damage to Apaches onshore and offshore Gulf of Mexico production and transportation facilities, third party pipelines, terminals and processing facilities, which the Company relies upon to transport and process its crude oil and natural gas also sustained substantial damage. For a discussion of the impact on 2006 and 2005 operations and results refer to Results of Operations and Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures in this Item 7. Results of Operations This section includes a discussion of our 2006 and 2005 results of operations and provides insight into unique events and circumstances for each of the Companys six reportable segments. Please refer to Note 12, Business Segment Information of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for segment information. 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures 2006 Acquisitions U.S. Permian Basin On January 5, 2006, the Company purchased Amerada Hesss interest in eight fields located in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from $404 million to $269 million because other interest owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase a number of the properties. The settlement price at closing of $239 million was adjusted for revenues and expenditures occurring between the effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. The acquired fields had estimated proved reserves of 27 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 27 Bcf of natural gas as of yearend 2005. Argentina On April 25, 2006, the Company acquired the operations of Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer) in Argentina for $675 million. The settlement price at closing, of $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and expenditures occurring between the effective date and closing date of the acquisition. The properties are located in the Neuqun, San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and had estimated net proved reserves of approximately 22 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of natural gas as of December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing plants (five operated and three non operated), 112 miles of operated pipelines in the Neuqun basin and 2,200 square miles of three dimensional (3 D) seismic data were also included in the transactions. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands): Proved property $ 501,938 Unproved property 189,500 Gas Plants 51,200 Working capital acquired, net 11,256 Asset retirement obligation (13,635 ) Deferred income tax liability (37,630 ) Cash consideration $ 702,629 On September 19, 2006, Apache acquired additional interests in (and now operates) seven concessions in the Tierra del Fuego Province from Pan American Fueguina S.R.L. (Pan American) for total consideration of $429 million. The settlement price at closing of $396 million was adjusted for normal closing items, including revenues and expenses between the effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. The total cash consideration allocated below includes working capital balances purchased, asset retirement obligations assumed and an obligation to deliver specific gas volumes in the future. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands): Proved property $ 289,916 Unproved property 132,000 Gas plants 12,722 Working capital acquired, net 8,929 Asset retirement obligation (1,511 ) Assumed obligation (46,000 ) Cash consideration $ 396,056 21 Offshore Gulf of Mexico In June 2006, the Company acquired the remaining producing properties of BP plc (BP) on the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from $1.3 billion for 18 producing fields to $845 million because other interest owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase five of the 18 fields. The purchase price consisted of $747 million of proved property, $42 million of unproved property and $56 million of facilities. The settlement price on the date of closing of $821 million was adjusted primarily for revenues and expenditures occurring between the April 1, 2006 effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. The acquired properties include 13 producing fields (nine of which are operated) with estimated proved reserves of 19.5 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 148 Bcf of natural gas. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. Pending Acquisition U.S. Permian Basin On January 18, 2007, the Company announced that it is acquiring controlling interest in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian basin of West Texas from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these fields had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls) of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas as of yearend 2006. The transaction will be effective the earlier of closing or March 31, 2007. Approximately 10 percent of the Permian basin properties are subject to third party preferential purchase rights which, if exercised, would reduce the interests we purchase in those properties and the purchase price we would pay. The Company intends to fund the acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko are entering into a joint venture arrangement to effect the transaction. In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into cash flow hedges to protect against commodity price volatility. For the period of July 2007 through June 2010, the Company entered into hedges for a portion of both the oil and the natural gas with NYMEX based costless collars. 2006 Divestitures On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 55 percent interest in the deepwater section of Egypts West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for $413 million. Apache did not have any proved reserves booked for these properties. On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block offshore, the Peoples Republic of China, to Australia based ROC Oil Company Limited for $260 million, marking Apaches exit from China. The effective date of the transaction was July 1, 2006. The Company recorded a gain of $174 million in the third quarter of 2006. 2005 Acquisitions In May 2005, Apache signed a farm in agreement with Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) covering approximately 650,000 acres of undeveloped properties in the Western Canadian province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache is to drill and operate 145 new wells over a 36 month period with upside potential for further drilling. ExxonMobil will retain a royalty on fee lands and a convertible working interest on leasehold acreage. The agreement also allows Apache to test additional horizons on approximately 140,000 acres of property covered in a 2004 farm in agreement with ExxonMobil. Revenues Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Given the current tightly balanced supply demand market, small variations in either supply or demand, or both, can have dramatic effects on prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while other economic factors could impact demand. 22 Oil and Natural Gas Prices While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a worldwide market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions. Apache primarily sells its natural gas into four markets: 1) North America, which has a common market and where supply and demand are currently tightly balanced, creating a volatile pricing environment; 2) Australia, which has a local market with mostly fixed price contracts; 3) Egypt, which has a local market where the price received for our production is indexed to a weighted average Dated Brent crude oil price; most of which is subject to a ceiling of $2.65 per MMBtu at oil prices of $21 per barrel or above; and 4) Argentina, where the price we receive on a portion of our natural gas production is regulated by the government, at prices from $.38 to $1.40 per MMBtu. The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with seasonal factors. The remainder of the volumes are sold at market driven prices, presently in excess of $2.00/MMBtu. For specific marketing arrangements by segment, please refer to Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties of this Form 10 K. 23 Revenues The table below presents oil and gas production revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids for the most recent three years. For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Revenues (in thousands): Oil $ 4,911,861 $ 4,413,934 $ 2,986,208 Natural gas 3,001,246 2,928,578 2,217,983 Natural gas liquids 161,146 114,779 103,826 Total $ 8,074,253 $ 7,457,291 $ 5,308,017 Oil Volume Barrels per day: United States 66,832 66,268 67,872 Canada 20,715 22,499 25,305 Egypt 56,570 55,141 52,183 Australia 11,892 15,379 25,174 North Sea 58,544 65,488 52,836 Argentina 6,857 1,163 566 China 3,167 8,132 7,583 Total 224,577 234,070 231,519 Average Oil Price Per barrel: United States $ 54.22 $ 47.97 $ 38.75 Canada 59.90 53.05 38.57 Egypt 63.60 53.69 37.35 Australia 68.25 57.61 41.96 North Sea 63.04 53.00 24.22 Argentina 42.79 37.54 32.89 China 62.73 44.24 32.88 Total 59.92 51.66 35.24 Natural Gas Volume Mcf per day: United States 666,965 597,481 646,619 Canada 404,325 371,917 326,965 Egypt 217,601 165,710 137,737 Australia 186,119 123,295 118,108 North Sea 2,061 2,306 1,871 Argentina 111,994 3,114 3,808 Total 1,589,065 1,263,823 1,235,108 Average Natural Gas Price Per Mcf: United States $ 6.54 $ 7.22 $ 5.45 Canada 6.09 7.29 5.30 Egypt 4.42 4.59 4.35 Australia 1.65 1.72 1.65 North Sea 10.64 9.17 5.53 Argentina .97 1.14 .65 Total 5.17 6.35 4.91 NGL Volume Barrels per day: United States 7,985 7,553 8,268 Canada 2,187 2,235 2,588 Argentina 1,537 Total 11,709 9,788 10,856 Average NGL Price Per barrel: United States $ 38.54 $ 32.44 $ 26.66 Canada 35.40 31.07 24.44 Argentina 36.64 Total 37.70 32.13 26.13 24 Contributions to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues As with production and reserves, a consequence of geographic diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues and natural gas revenues. For the reasons discussed in the Oil and Natural Gas Prices section above, contributions to oil revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately. The following table presents each segments oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues, respectively. Oil Revenues Gas Revenues For the Year Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 United States 27 % 26 % 32 % 53 % 54 % 58 % Canada 9 % 10 % 12 % 30 % 34 % 29 % North America 36 % 36 % 44 % 83 % 88 % 87 % Egypt 27 % 25 % 24 % 12 % 9 % 10 % Australia 6 % 7 % 13 % 4 % 3 % 3 % North Sea 27 % 29 % 16 % Argentina 2 % 1 % Other International 2 % 3 % 3 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Crude Oil Contribution In 2006, oil revenue contributions outside of North America were 64 percent of our total consolidated oil revenues, equal to 2005 contributions. Except for Australia, all core regions saw oil revenue growth in 2006 when compared to 2005. Egypt and the United States saw their contributions rise as their 2006 revenue gains, relative to 2005, outpaced gains in our other regions, benefiting from both higher relative oil prices and production. Argentinas contribution increase in 2006, compared to 2005, was virtually all attributable to the 2006 acquisitions discussed above, although the region also benefited from price improvement. The North Sea and Canadas 2006 contributions fell because higher prices were somewhat neutralized by lower relative production and higher oil revenue in other core areas. In 2005, oil revenue contributions from outside the U.S. rose six percent to 74 percent of our total consolidated oil revenues. Production growth and significantly higher price realizations drove the North Seas oil revenue contributions to 29 percent of consolidated oil revenues from 16 percent the prior year and were largely responsible for the growth of non U.S. oil revenues. U.S. oil revenues made up 26 percent of 2005 oil revenues, down six percent from 2004, a consequence of the 2005 hurricane activity and the significant growth in North Sea production. Australias contribution to 2005 consolidated oil revenues fell to seven percent from 13 percent on a 39 percent decrease in production compared to 2004. Crude Oil Revenues Crude oil revenues in 2006 increased $498 million from 2005 to $4.9 billion. Price gains across all regions, which averaged $8.26 more per barrel than 2005, generated an additional $706 million of revenues. These additional revenues were partially offset by the effect on revenues from a four percent decline in production. All segments reported a significant increase in realized crude oil price, with Argentina, Egypt, and the U.S. also benefiting from production growth compared to 2005. Egypt generated an additional $233 million of crude oil revenue in 2006 when compared to 2005. An 18 percent increase in crude oil price realizations, generated $200 million of the additional revenues, with the remainder coming from a three percent increase in production. While Egypt experienced production growth in many areas, the predominate contributor was the Khalda Concession which benefited from a full year of associated condensate related to increased Qasr field gas production. 25 U.S. crude oil revenues for 2006 increased $162 million compared to 2005, with a 13 percent increase in crude oil price realizations contributing $151 million of the additional revenues. A small increase in 2006 oil production, relative to 2005, contributed the remaining $11 million. The third quarter 2005 hurricanes reduced Apaches 2006 average annual daily crude oil production 13,100 barrels per day (b/d), compared to 10,813 b/d in 2005. Shut in production reduced the Companys 2006 and 2005 crude oil revenues by approximately $297 million and $186 million, respectively. Central region production rose 18 percent, reflecting drilling and recompletion activity in the Permian basin and Southeast New Mexico, and the Amerada Hess acquired properties. Gulf Coast production was 10 percent below 2005 levels with downtime, hurricane production shut ins and natural decline outpacing growth attributed to drilling and recompletion activity and the BP acquired properties. The Gulf Coast regions fourth quarter 2006 production averaged 43,995 b/d compared to 23,487 b/d in the comparable 2005 quarter, a testament to the progress in returning hurricane damaged properties to production during 2006, as well as the benefit of the BP acquired properties. Argentinas 2006 oil revenues increased $91 million over 2005 with $89 million of the increase associated with production growth, driven primarily by acquired properties and subsequent exploitation activities. Higher oil price realizations generated the other $2 million. The North Seas 2006 crude oil revenues were $80 million higher than 2005 with $240 million of additional revenues generated from a 19 percent increase in price realizations, partially offset by lower production, which was down 11 percent on a comparative basis. Production was lower in 2006 primarily because of production interruptions associated with commissioning of major infrastructure projects and temporary unplanned shutdown of the third party Forties Pipeline System during the third quarter of 2006. The focus in 2006 on upgrades also displaced drilling operations necessary to mitigate natural decline. Canadas 2006 oil revenues increased $17 million over 2005, with $56 million of additional revenues associated with higher price realizations, partially offset by lower production, which was down eight percent. Canada production was down in most areas as natural decline exceeded drilling and production enhancement activities. Australias 2006 crude oil revenues were $27 million less than 2005, reflecting a 23 percent decline in production and an 18 percent increase in realized price. The production decrease resulted from normal field decline which offset a full year of associated condensate production from the John Brookes field and other development activities, mainly in the Bambra, Zephyrus and Stag areas. Chinas 2006 oil revenues were $59 million less than 2005, a consequence of the August 2006 divestiture. Apache manages a small portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices using financial derivatives. Approximately nine percent of our worldwide crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges in 2006, compared to six percent in 2005. (See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments, of this Form 10 K for a summary of the current derivative positions and terms.) These financial derivative instruments reduced our 2006 and 2005 worldwide realized prices $1.37 and $.68 per barrel, respectively. Natural Gas Contribution Our North American operations contributed 83 percent of 2006 consolidated natural gas revenues, down five percent from 2005. All core gas producing regions generated additional revenues in 2006 on production growth. However, these incremental production revenues were all but eliminated by the effect of lower prices, especially in our North American regions, where prices are typically higher, but more volatile, than our other regions. Revenues in the U.S. and Canada dropped in 2006 on a comparative basis, while all other core gas producing regions experienced an increase in revenue. Egypts contribution to 2006 consolidated gas revenues rose three percent in 2006, compared to 2005, while Australias contribution increased one percent. Argentina contributed one percent of consolidated gas revenues. In 2005, 88 percent of Apaches natural gas revenues came from North America, 54 percent from the U.S. and 34 percent from Canada. The U.S. contribution decreased four percent from 2004, primarily because of production declines, the impact Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had on U.S. Gulf of Mexico revenues, and the additional revenues generated by Canada and Egypt. Our U.S. Gulf Coast region, which contributed 63 percent of Apaches U.S. 2005 26 production, down six percent from 2004, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial production rates followed by steep declines when compared to most other U.S. producing areas. Canadas contribution was up five percent from 2004 resulting from 14 percent production growth and higher price gains, relative to other areas. Egypts contribution to total gas revenues decreased slightly to nine percent from 10 percent in 2004. Australias contribution to 2005 natural gas revenues remained the same as 2004 at three percent. Natural Gas Revenues Our 2006 consolidated natural gas revenues increased $73 million from the prior year with $614 million of additional revenues generated from production growth mostly offset by the effect of a 19 percent decline in realized prices. All core gas producing regions generated additional revenues in 2006 from production growth; however they were mostly offset by lower relative natural gas prices. Egypt contributed $73 million more to 2006 consolidated natural gas revenues compared to 2005 on a 31 percent increase in production and a four percent decrease in realized gas prices. The year over year production growth came primarily from the Khalda concession, mostly attributable to a full year of production from the Qasr field. Argentinas 2006 natural gas revenues increased $38 million compared to 2005, with all of the additional revenues associated with production growth. As with oil, the production growth primarily came from acquired properties and subsequent exploitation activities. Australias 2006 natural gas revenues were $35 million higher than 2005. Natural gas production increases added $38 million to revenues, while lower gas price realizations reduced revenues $3 million. The additional production was attributed to a full year of production from the John Brookes field. U.S. natural gas revenues were $17 million higher in 2006 than 2005. U.S. natural gas production, up 12 percent, contributed $166 million of additional revenues, while a nine percent price decline lowered revenues $149 million, when compared to 2005. The 2005 hurricanes reduced Apaches 2006 average annual daily natural gas production 37 MMcf/d compared to 59 MMcf/d in 2005. Shut in production from the hurricanes reduced the Companys 2006 and 2005 natural gas revenues by approximately $95 million and $211 million, respectively. Central region production rose 16 percent from 2005, benefiting from drilling and recompletion activity, primarily in Central and Western Oklahoma, in East Texas, and from acquired properties. Gulf Coast region production was nine percent above year ago levels on the BP acquired properties, hurricane restoration, and drilling and recompletion activity, principally in the Chauvin, Ship Shoal and South Timbalier fields. Canadas 2006 natural gas revenues decreased $91 million from 2005. An additional $72 million of revenues generated from a nine percent increase in production were more than offset by the impact of a 16 percent decrease in realized natural gas prices. Canadas production growth was concentrated in the North and South Grant Lands and Kabob areas, with activity in other areas more than offset by natural decline. Our 2005 natural gas revenues increased $711 million with a $1.44 per Mcf increase in our average natural gas price realizations generating an additional $652 million of revenues. Higher production added the remaining $59 million. While all of our operating segments reported an increase in natural gas price realizations, most of the additional revenues attributable to price came from the U.S. and Canada as prices skyrocketed following the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. The additional revenues attributable to production were primarily generated in Egypt, where natural gas production increased 20 percent, reflecting the success of our drilling program. Canada and Australia also contributed to increased production revenues with production growth of 14 percent and four percent, respectively. Canadas increase was from new wells, while Australias increase was driven by higher customer demand and new contractual sales. Partially offsetting these additional production revenues was an eight percent decrease in U.S. production, primarily in the Gulf Coast region, related to the impact of the 2005 hurricanes and natural decline in mature fields. The majority of our worldwide gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing local market prices. As a result Apache uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices including fixed price contracts and derivatives. In the U.S. and Canada most of our gas is sold on a monthly basis at either monthly or daily market prices; however, during 2006 and 2005, approximately eight percent and 10 percent of our U.S. natural 27 gas production, respectively, was subject to long term, fixed price physical contracts. These contracts provide a measure of protection to the Company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices. These fixed price contracts reduced our 2006 and 2005 worldwide realized natural gas prices by $.10 per Mcf and $.19 per Mcf, respectively. In Australia, nearly all of our natural gas production is subject to long term fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in Australias consumer price index. The majority of Egypts gas is sold to Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) under an Industry Pricing Formula tied to Dated Brent crude oil with a maximum price of $2.65 per MMbtu. However, in certain concessions Apache has retained a higher gas price formula until 2013 for up to 100 MMcf/d produced. Approximately eight percent of our worldwide natural gas production was subject to financial derivative hedges for 2006 compared to nine percent in 2005. These financial derivative instruments reduced our 2006 and 2005 consolidated realized prices $.05 per Mcf and $.15 per Mcf, respectively. (See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a summary of current derivative positions and terms.) Costs The tables below compare our costs on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference either expenses on a boe basis or expenses on an absolute dollar basis, or both, depending on their relevance. Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) (Per boe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment $ 1,699 $ 1,325 $ 1,149 $ 9.29 $ 7.99 $ 7.01 Other assets 118 91 73 .64 .55 .44 Asset retirement obligation accretion 89 54 46 .48 .32 .28 Lease operating costs 1,362 1,041 864 7.45 6.27 5.27 Gathering and transportation costs 104 100 82 .57 .60 .50 Severance and other taxes 554 453 94 3.03 2.73 .57 General and administrative expenses 211 198 173 1.16 1.20 1.06 China litigation 71 .43 Financing costs, net 142 116 117 .78 .70 .71 Total $ 4,279 $ 3,378 $ 2,669 $ 23.40 $ 20.36 $ 16.27 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Apaches Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) of oil and gas properties is calculated using the Units of Production Method (UOP). The UOP calculation in simplest terms multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter times the costs of those reserves. The result is to recognize expense at the same pace that the reservoirs are actually depleting. The costs in the UOP calculation include both the net capitalized amounts on the balance sheet, and the estimated future costs to access and develop reserves needing additional facilities, equipment or downhole work in order to produce. Under the full cost method of accounting, the DD&A calculation is prepared separately for each country in which Apache operates. Absolute DD&A determines the expense reported each period, while the cost per unit of production (DD&A rate) provides insight into the overall costs of the Companys reserves growth. Current costs incurred to drill or acquire additional reserves that are higher than the historical cost level raises the overall DD&A rate. Conversely, if reserves are added in the current period at a rate per unit less than existing levels, they average down the Companys DD&A rate. Changes from period to period in absolute DD&A expense are determined by production levels, the mix of production (high cost country versus a low cost country) and the impact of recent spending (higher or lower DD&A rates). Our 2006 full cost DD&A expense totaled $1.7 billion, $374 million more than 2005. Our 2006 full cost DD&A rate of $9.29 per boe was $1.30 per boe more than 2005, reflecting rising acquisition costs, higher 28 abandonment cost estimates, rising industry wide drilling and finding costs, especially in the U.S. and Canada, and incremental future development costs associated with recent acquisitions and newly identified development projects. The increase in costs, including increased estimates of future development costs, is related to increased demand for drilling and associated services, a consequence of both higher oil and gas prices and additional demand resulting from the ongoing need to repair damage caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The increase in 2006 DD&A, relative to 2005 was mitigated by a decline in Egypt resulting from the January 2006 sale of Egypts deepwater acreage. Our 2006 full cost DD&A expense was $73 million lower because of the production shut in for hurricane damage. Our 2005 full cost DD&A expense totaled $1.3 billion, $176 million more than 2004. Our 2005 full cost DD&A rate of $7.99 per boe was $.98 per boe more than 2004, driven by rising industry wide drilling costs, especially in the U.S., Canada, the North Sea and Egypt. Higher commodity prices experienced throughout 2005, as well as the affect of the 2005 U.S. hurricanes, led to increased demand for drilling services and thus higher current drilling costs and higher estimated future development costs. The North Seas impact on our consolidated rate reflects the continuation of facility upgrades undertaken during 2005 to improve the overall efficiency of platforms. Our 2005 full cost DD&A expense was $57 million lower because of the production shut in for hurricane damage. Depreciation of other assets increased $27 million in 2006, reflecting ongoing development of infrastructure in Canada that began in 2005 to accommodate development on the acquired ExxonMobil acreage, and the Qasr field support facilities in Egypt, including completion of the Tarek gas plant inter connect. Depreciation of other assets increased $18 million in 2005, reflecting new infrastructure built in Canada to accommodate development on acreage acquired from ExxonMobil in 2004 and new Qasr natural gas facilities in Egypt. Impairments We assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of acreage. When impairment occurs, costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. Impairments in international areas without proved reserves are charged to earnings upon determination that impairment has occurred. Goodwill is subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment. Goodwill totaled $189 million on December 31, 2006, and no impairment was recorded in 2006, 2005 or 2004. For further discussion, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Lease Operating Costs Lease operating expenses (LOE) are comprised of several components: direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, workover costs and ad valorem taxes. LOE rates are driven by the underlying commodity price levels, whether oil or gas is produced, level of workover activity and geographical location of the properties. Commodity prices have a significant impact on operating cost elements; both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, chemicals and ad valorem taxes, which are commodity price based. The remaining elements, which include among other things, labor, services and equipment, are indirectly impacted by high price environments which drive up activity and demand and therefore, increase costs. All components of LOE have been rising throughout the industry for several years with historically strong oil and gas prices. Also, oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote plants and facilities. Workovers allow us to exploit our existing reserve base by accelerating production, taking advantage of high prices. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact the Companys LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding to per unit costs and a stronger U.S. dollar lowering per unit costs. The Company reviews production costs in each of its core areas on a monthly basis and pursues alternatives to maintain efficient levels of costs. The following discussion will focus on per unit operating costs as management believes this is the most informative method of analyzing LOE trends. 29 Rising per unit cost remained a challenge in 2006 with LOE averaging $7.45 per boe, $1.18 per boe higher than 2005. The 2005 hurricanes increased our worldwide rate by $.44 and $.41 per boe in 2006 and 2005, respectively, a reflection of shut in production and additional expenses in excess of our insurance coverage. The remainder of the increase was driven by industry wide cost increases, as discussed above, workover activity, a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar and British Pound and higher non hurricane related repair costs in our U.S. Gulf Coast and Canadian regions. Regionally, 2006 LOE was up from 2005 as follows: U.S. The U.S. added $.63 per boe to the 2006 worldwide rate. The Central region added $.04 per boe, with production growth nearly outpacing increases in costs, while the Gulf Coast region added $.59 per boe. In addition to the impact of industry wide cost increases, activity levels soared in the Gulf of Mexico as producers continue to repair and restore production following the 2005 hurricanes. This increase in demand on top of an already tight supply market for boats, helicopters, divers, labor, equipment and parts to complete repairs, pushed costs even higher in the region. The regions fourth quarter 2006 LOE included approximately $26 million for repairs in excess of insurance coverage. We will incur an estimated $60 million of additional LOE expenses to complete the repairs during the first half of 2007. The 2006 rate increase was also impacted by additional workover activity, higher insurance rates and more non hurricane repair costs, relative to 2005. Canada Canada added $.40 per boe to the 2006 worldwide rate. Higher costs added $.46 per boe, however, higher production offset $.06 of that increase. Twenty two percent of the increase in Canadas rate was attributed to the strengthening Canadian dollar. The balance related to a higher level of workover activity, higher repair and maintenance costs, reclamation and restoration projects undertaken during 2006 and the general rise in costs, including increases in power rates, contract labor and fuel. Egypt Egypt added $.02 to the 2006 worldwide rate as a $32 million increase in costs, including increased workover activity, was mostly offset by associated production growth. Australia Australia reduced the 2006 worldwide rate $.11 per boe with production growth more than offsetting associated incremental operating costs. North Sea The North Sea added $.37 per boe to the 2006 consolidated rate, with approximately two thirds of the increase in rate related to lower relative production, the strengthening British Pound and an increase in pension liabilities. The balance of the increase in costs related to major 2006 turnaround activity, higher fuel rates and usage as major projects were commissioned, and higher maintenance and repair activity, relative to 2005. Argentina Argentina reduced the 2006 consolidated rate $.19 per boe with production growth related to the 2006 acquisitions more than offsetting associated incremental operating costs. On a per unit produced basis, 2005 LOE averaged $6.27 per boe, $1.00 per boe higher than 2004. Production shut ins and additional insurance costs associated with the 2005 hurricanes added $.41 to the 2005 rate. The remaining increase reflects higher service costs associated with rising commodity prices and the associated increase in demand for services, an increase in workover activity, higher repair and maintenance costs and the impact a weaker U.S. dollar had on Canadian LOE. The slight strengthening against the Australian dollar and British pound had less impact on LOE. Regionally, 2005 LOE was up as follows: U.S. The U.S. added $.77 per boe to the 2005 consolidated rate with nearly one third of the impact attributed to the additional insurance costs and production shut ins caused by the 2005 hurricanes. Higher contract labor costs, workover activity, repair and maintenance, and various other commodity price driven service costs accounted for the remaining impact. Gulf Coast region LOE included approximately $30 million for insurance deductibles and additional premiums assessed by OIL. Australia Australia added $.15 per boe to the 2005 consolidated rate on a 20 percent drop in equivalent production. Australia also saw a rise in insurance cost. Lower production added $.13 per boe to the 2005 consolidated rate, while additional costs added $.02 per boe. 30 Canada Canada added $.21 per boe to the 2005 consolidated rate increase, with costs adding $.27 per boe, partially offset by the impact of higher volumes, which reduced the rate $.06 per boe. 2005 costs were up $44 million from 2004, with 42 percent attributable to the strengthening Canadian dollar. The balance related to various other costs associated with an increase in activity and the general rise in costs, including higher contract labor, power and fuel, repair and maintenance and workover costs. Egypt Egypts 2005 costs were $23 million higher than 2004 on higher diesel fuel costs, an increase in workover activity, higher labor costs and insurance costs. The diesel fuel costs were previously subsidized by the Egyptian government. Egypt added $.04 per boe to the consolidated rate increase, with higher costs adding $.14 per boe and increased volumes lowering the rate $.10 per boe. North Sea The North Sea reduced the 2005 consolidated rate $.16 per boe on a 24 percent increase in production, partially offset by a two percent increase in costs. North Sea costs were up on increased repair and maintenance activity. Gathering and Transportation Costs Apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two types of agreements, typical in our industry. Both types of agreements include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which Apache sells oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collects a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. In this case, the Company records sales at the price received from the purchaser, which is net of transportation costs. Under the other arrangement, Apache sells oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pays transportation to a third party carrier and receives from the purchaser a price with no transportation deduction. In this case, the Company records the transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. The Companys treatment of transportation costs is pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs and as a result a portion of our transporting costs is reflected in sales prices and a portion is reflected as Gathering and Transportation Costs rendering the separately identified transportation costs incomplete. In both the U.S. and Canada, Apache sells oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, Apache pays transportation to a third party carrier and receives a purchase price with no transportation deduction. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production has historically been sold to EGPC under netback arrangements. During 2005 and 2006, Apache exported a portion of its Egyptian crude oil under both types of arrangements. Future export cargoes may be sold at the loading port or Apache may arrange shipping and receive prices which include transportation. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs paid directly by Apache to third party carriers for each of the periods presented. For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) U.S. $ 32 $ 30 $ 28 Canada 34 33 31 North Sea 26 28 22 Egypt 11 8 Argentina 1 Other International 1 1 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 104 $ 100 $ 82 These costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our North American operations, North Sea crude oil sales and Egyptian crude oil exports. The four percent increase in costs for 2006 was driven primarily by U.S. production growth and Egyptian crude exports. 31 Transportation costs in 2005 increased 22 percent from 2004 driven primarily by the North Seas production growth and Egyptian crude exports. Apache began exporting Egyptian crude in the second half of 2004 and first incurred third party transportation charges in early 2005. Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes are primarily comprised of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties field in the U.K. North Sea. We are also subject to the Australian Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), and various Canadian taxes including the Freehold Mineral Tax, Saskatchewan Capital Tax and Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. The Canadian Federal Large Corporation Tax was phased out in 2006. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses. For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Severance taxes $ 124 $ 139 $ 127 U.K. PRT 394 285 (61 ) Canadian taxes 16 22 23 Other 20 7 5 Total Severance and Other Taxes $ 554 $ 453 $ 94 Severance and other taxes totaled $554 million in 2006, $101 million greater than 2005. U.K. PRT increased $109 million in 2006 on a six percent increase in revenue and a 21 percent decrease in qualifying capital spending. Australias severance taxes declined on lower revenues associated with lower oil production. Canadas severance taxes decreased $6 million with the phase out of the federal large corporation tax. Other taxes increased $13 million on additional U.S. franchise taxes, consistent with our growth and a $5 million special profits charge levied on petroleum revenues by the Chinese government. In 2005, severance and other taxes increased $359 million. U.K. PRT increased $346 million in 2005 on significantly higher oil price realizations and higher production. U.S. severance taxes increased $36 million on higher oil and gas prices. Australias taxes decreased $24 million reflecting lower excise tax on declining production from the Legendre field. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses (G&A) averaged $1.16 per boe for 2006, $.04 per boe less than 2005. Absolute costs increased $13 million to $211 million. The additional cost in 2006 was primarily associated with expansion of international operations in conjunction with acquisitions and increasing insurance costs. G&A of $1.20 per boe in 2005 increased $.14 per boe over 2004. Absolute costs increased $25 million, or 14 percent. Nearly three fourths of the increase in year over year costs related to the impact of Apaches stock based compensation programs. Stock based compensation costs increased relative to the prior year because of new stock option grants issued in 2005, a new targeted stock plan approved by stockholders in May 2005, and the impact Apaches rising common stock price had on stock based compensation expense. The balance of the G&A increase was primarily attributed to the increased cost of insurance, a consequence of the hurricanes, higher charitable contributions and higher Sarbanes Oxley compliance audit fees. Financing Costs, Net The major components of financing costs, net, include interest expense and capitalized interest. 32 Net financing costs for 2006 were $26 million higher than in 2005. Gross interest expense increased $42 million in 2006 as a result of a higher average debt balance and higher short term interest rates. Capitalized interest increased $4 million, a result of a higher average unproved property balance. Interest income rose $10 million compared to 2005 on higher cash balances. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2006 was 6.3 percent compared to 6.7 percent on December 31, 2005. Net financing costs in 2005 were slightly lower than 2004. Gross interest expense increased $7 million in 2005, on a higher average debt balance. This was mostly offset by a $6 million increase in the amount of interest capitalized as a result of a higher average unproved property balance. Our weighted average cost of borrowing was 6.7 percent on December 31, 2005 and 6.1 percent on December 31, 2004. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for 2006 totaled $1.5 billion, $125 million less than 2005. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 36.3 percent, down from 37.6 percent in 2005. The 2006 effective rate was impacted by a combination of federal and provincial tax rate reductions enacted by Canada during the second quarter of 2006, a 10 percent increase in the oil and gas company supplemental tax enacted by the U.K. during the third quarter of 2006 and the gain recognized on the sale of China, as discussed below. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on the 2006 effective tax rate. The effective income tax rate for 2006 was impacted by the gain recognized in conjunction with divestment of operations in China. The Company intends to permanently reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and as such, has not recorded U.S. income tax expense on any undistributed foreign earnings, including the gain from the China sale. Income tax expense in 2005 of $1.6 billion was $590 million or 20 percent higher than 2004. The higher taxes were driven by higher taxable income related to increased oil and gas revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. Our effective tax rate was 37.6 percent in 2005 compared to 37.3 percent in 2004. Currency fluctuations added $13 million of additional deferred tax expense to 2005 and $58 million to 2004. For a discussion of Apaches sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations, please refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Foreign Currency Risk of this Form 10 K. Capital Resources and Liquidity Financial Indicators At December 31, Millions of dollars except as indicated 2006 2005 2004 Current ratio .65 .99 1.05 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,313 $ 4,332 $ 3,232 Total debt 3,822 2,192 2,588 Shareholders equity 13,191 10,541 8,204 Percent of total debt to capitalization 22 % 17 % 24 % Floating rate debt/total debt 43 % 15 % Overview Apaches primary uses of cash are exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs and expenses necessary to maintain continued operations, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will shrink. Cash investments are continuously required to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves. See Item 1 and 2, Business and Properties, Risks Factors, in this Form 10 K. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on having 33 adequate capital resources available, on our success in both exploration and development activities and on acquiring additional reserves. Our 2006 yearend reserve life index indicates an average decline of 7.9 percent per year. This projection is based on prices at yearend 2006, except in those instances where future natural gas and oil sales are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or lower prices, estimates of investments required to develop estimated proved undeveloped reserves, and costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in Note 13, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through net cash provided by operating activities (cash flow) and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flow. Our cash flow, both in the short and long term, is impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, we only forecast, for internal use by management, an annual cash flow. Longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are not used by management to operate our business. The annual cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to the adjusted cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs. The Company has historically utilized internally generated cash flow, committed and uncommitted credit facilities and access to both debt and equity capital markets for all other liquidity and capital resources needs. Because of the liquidity and capital resources alternatives available to Apache, including internally generated cash flows, Apaches management believes that its short term and long term liquidity will be adequate to fund operations, including its capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was .65 on December 31, 2006 compared to .99 at the end of 2005. Current liabilities increased 74 percent ($1.6 billion) in 2006 versus a 15 percent ($328 million) increase in current assets. Changes in our current debt particularly impacted the ratio. The Company had $1.6 billion of commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2006 that was subsequently reduced with proceeds from $1.5 billion of long term debt issued in January 2007. Also, another $173 million of debt is payable in 2007. The current ARO liability of $377 million, an increase of $283 million over 2005, reflects the cost expected to be incurred over the next 12 months to abandon the platforms damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in current liabilities was partially offset by overall decreases in our current derivative payable, the U.K. PRT liability, accrued income taxes, and accounts payable of $186 million, $175 million, $118 million and $70 million, respectively. Collectively, the increase in liabilities more than offset the higher current asset balances. The current derivative receivable increased $123 million, reflecting changes in oil and gas strip pricing. Current accounts receivables increased $207 million, or 14 percent, most of which was related to oil receivables impacted by higher oil prices. The remaining current asset categories, inventories, cash and drilling advances, decreased $45 million from 2005. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Apaches net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4.3 billion in both 2006 and 2005. For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, costs and expenses, please refer to the Results of Operations section of this Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For a detailed discussion of changes in current assets and current liabilities please refer to the discussion under the Overview of this Capital and Liquidity section. Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2005 totaled $4.3 billion, up from $3.2 billion in 2004. The increase in 2005 cash flow was attributed primarily to the significant increase in commodity prices. The Companys average realized oil and natural gas prices increased 47 percent and 29 percent, respectively; a reflection of higher worldwide commodity prices. Higher production also added to our 2005 cash flow relative to 2004, albeit to a much less extent. These increases in cash flow were partially offset by higher production costs attributable to the effect of increased commodity prices, costs related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and an increase in exchange rates in Canada. 34 Historically, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Companys short term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Sales volume changes have also impacted cash flow in the short term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Apaches long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations. Debt We exited 2006 with a debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 22 percent, compared to 17 percent at the end of 2005. Yearend 2006 outstanding current and long term debt totaled $3.8 billion, $1.6 billion higher than yearend 2005. The increase was associated with the issuance of commercial paper in conjunction with $2.4 billion of acquisitions. The Companys outstanding debt consisted of notes and debentures maturing in the years 2007 through 2096. Approximately $1.8 billion of our total debt is due in 2007. This debt consists of $1.6 billion of commercial paper, that was subsequently reduced with $1.5 billion of long term debt issued in January 2007, and $170 million of Apache Finance Australia 6.5 percent notes and various money market lines of credit in Argentina and the U.S. The $1.6 billion of commercial paper is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under committed credit facilities which expire in 2011. An additional $100 million in debt matures in 2009 with the remaining $1.9 billion maturing thereafter. On January 26, 2007, the Company issued $500 million principal amount, $499.5 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 5.625 percent notes maturing January 15, 2017. The Company also issued $1.0 billion principal amount, $993 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 6.0 percent notes maturing January 15, 2037. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apaches option, subject to a make whole premium. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Please refer to Note 5 Debt, Subsequent Debt of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. In May 2006, the Company amended its existing five year revolving U.S. credit facility which was scheduled to mature on May 28, 2009. The amendment: (a) extended the maturity to May 28, 2011, (b) increased the size of the facility from $750 million to $1.5 billion, and (c) reduced the facility fees from .08 percent to .06 percent and reduced the margin over LIBOR on loans from .27 percent to .19 percent. The lenders also extended the maturity dates of the $150 million Canadian facility, the $150 million Australian facility and $385 million of the $450 million U.S. credit facility, for an additional year to May 12, 2011 from May 12, 2010. The Company also increased commercial paper availability to $1.95 billion from $1.20 billion. By yearend 2006, the Company extended the maturity of another $50 million of commitments under the $450 million U.S. credit facility for an additional year. As a result, $435 million will mature on May 12, 2011, and $15 million will mature on May 12, 2010. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the Companys consolidated assets. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group. There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2006. 35 Stock Transactions On April 19, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 million shares of the Companys common stock representing a market value of approximately $1 billion on the date of announcement. The Company may buy shares from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or a combination of both. The timing and amounts of any purchases will be at the discretion of Apaches management. The Company initiated the purchase program on May 1, 2006, after the Companys first quarter 2006 earnings information was disseminated in the market. Through December 31, 2006, the Company purchased 2,500,000 shares at an average price of $69.74 per share. Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures The Company funded its exploration and development (E&D) capital expenditures, gathering, transportation and marketing (GTM) investments, capitalized interest and asset retirement costs of $4.4 billion, $4.4 billion and $2.7 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily with internally generated cash flow of $4.3 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.2 billion. The Company uses a combination of internally generated cash flow, borrowings under the Companys lines of credit and commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund its significant acquisitions. During 2005 and 2004, the Company primarily used internally generated cash flow or its lines of credit and commercial paper program, which were subsequently paid down with internally generated cash flow. In 2006, the Company primarily used its commercial paper program to fund its significant acquisitions. The commercial paper was subsequently repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in January 2007. The following table presents a summary of the Companys Capital Expenditures for each of our reportable segments for the past three years. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Exploration and Development: United States $ 1,532,959 $ 1,072,040 $ 755,056 Canada 1,056,614 1,188,096 756,912 Egypt 454,892 352,324 301,912 Australia 179,892 217,816 138,694 North Sea 329,498 489,072 362,054 Argentina 115,570 25,963 4,674 Other International 12,288 22,521 21,819 $ 3,681,713 $ 3,367,832 $ 2,341,121 Capitalized Interest $ 61,301 $ 56,988 $ 50,748 Gathering Transmission and Processing Facilities $ 248,589 $ 392,872 $ 138,738 Asset Retirement Costs (ARC) $ 228,384 $ 532,505 $ 37,758 ARC Acquired $ 162,228 $ 14,164 $ 156,195 Acquisitions: Oil and gas properties $ 2,310,853 $ 39,228 $ 1,063,851 Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities 117,579 $ 2,428,432 $ 39,228 $ 1,063,851 36 Capital expenditures, excluding ARC, totaled $6.4 billion in 2006, up 66 percent or $2.6 billion from 2005 driven by an increase in acquisition activity. The Company invested $3.7 billion on exploration and development activities in 2006 up nine percent from 2005 including drilling 1,611 wells. In the U.S., we invested $1.5 billion on exploration and development activities. Our Gulf Coast region invested approximately $1 billion on drilling, recompletions, and platform and production support facilities, including $50 million of associated hurricane redevelopment capital in excess of insurance coverage. The region drilled 60 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and 23 wells onshore, with a 78 percent success rate, despite ongoing hurricane repair activity. The Central region had its most active year ever investing $540 million including the drilling of 374 wells with a 97 percent success rate. The region added to its inventory of opportunities to grow production with the addition of Amerada Hesss Permian basin properties in Texas and New Mexico at the beginning of 2006 and will do so again with the close of the acquisition of additional Permian basin properties from Anadarko in the first quarter of 2007. Canadas drilling program accounted for more than half of the Companys wells drilled. The region invested $1.1 billion in 2006 on exploration and development activities and drilled 874 wells with an 85 percent success rate. Twenty five percent of those wells were on the undeveloped acreage Apache obtained through farm in agreements with ExxonMobil. We invested $329 million in the North Sea; $112 million of which was on facility upgrades intended to improve the operating efficiency and drilling capability in the Forties field. Four of the five exploration and development wells drilled during 2006 were productive. We completed the Forties power generation and gas ring in 2006, which reduced fuel oil generating costs and improved production reliability. We also started the upgrade of our produced water re injection system, upgraded the primary gas lift compression system and replaced instrumentation and control systems on several platforms. At the end of 2006, we were in the process of upgrading drilling equipment on all existing Forties platforms that will extend the reach of our drilling equipment, allowing us to determine if the bounds of the Forties field can be extended to the west. The latter project should be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007. Egypt had another active and successful exploration and development program investing $455 million and drilling 163 wells of which 86 percent were productive as we continued development of the Qasr field. In Australia, we invested $180 million in exploration and development activities as we participated in drilling 23 wells; 18 exploration wells and five development wells. Four of the exploration wells and three of the development wells were productive for a success rate of 30 percent. Our 2006 exploration and development activities in Argentina increased by $90 million over 2005 as we invested $116 million drilling 83 wells, 16 exploratory and 67 development, with a 89% success rate. The Company invested $249 million in gathering, transmission and processing facilities in 2006 compared to $393 million in 2005. In Canada we invested $130 million in processing plants, $106 million of which was to construct five additional gas processing plants to support production from wells drilled on the acreage we earned from ExxonMobil. Egypt invested $108 million to complete the Tarek gas plant pipeline inter connect and on expansion of gas processing facilities to alleviate the processing capacity bottleneck throttling deliverability. In 2006 we also recorded $391 million in asset retirement costs. The Gulf Coast region recorded an additional $232 million to reflect the estimated abandonment costs to be incurred resulting from the hurricane activity, in addition to the approximately $492 million recorded in 2005. This cost to abandon the 11 operated and 12 non operated platforms lost or severely damaged during the 2005 storms is expected to be incurred by the end of 2009 (See Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligations of Item 15 in this Form 10 K). We also recorded $162 million in asset retirement costs associated with our 2006 acquisition activity. On the acquisition front we invested a record $2.4 billion in 2006, closing four significant transactions; one in the Gulf of Mexico, one in West Texas and two in Argentina. Acquisition activity fluctuates from year to year based on the availability of acquisition opportunities that fit the Companys strategy. In 2005, the Company had its most active drilling year ever, drilling 2,383 wells investing $3.4 billion on exploration and development activities, a 44 percent increase from 2004. Approximately two thirds of our 2005 37 exploration and development expenditures were invested in Canada and the U.S., where nearly 69 percent of Apaches 2005 year end estimated proved reserves were located. Exploration and development expenditures in 2005 for Canada and the U.S. increased 57 percent and 42 percent, respectively, over 2004. Canada was our most active region, drilling 1,674 wells, 82 percent of which were shallow development wells. Canada was also very active in the undeveloped acreage Apache obtained through two farm in agreements with ExxonMobil. The Central region was the second most active region, drilling 364 wells, with a 97 percent success rate. In the Gulf Coast region, despite the disruptions caused by the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, we drilled 114 wells, including 66 offshore. Seventy seven percent of our Gulf Coast wells were productive. In the North Sea, we drilled a total of 23 wells, including 18 Forties field wells, and invested approximately $198 million of maintenance capital to continue to improve the operating efficiency of the Forties field. In Egypt, we drilled 121 wells of which 86 percent were productive. We continued development of the Qasr field, where gross production averaged 128 MMcf/d in December 2005. In Australia, we participated in drilling 36 wells; 26 exploration wells and 10 development wells. Chinas capital expenditures were flat compared to 2004 as they continued their development drilling program. In 2005 Apache also invested $393 million in gathering, transmission and processing facilities investing $180 million constructing 11 gas processing plants in Canada, six of which were completed by yearend, $182 million in Egypt developing Qasr field facilities and $31 million on facility upgrades in Australia. We incurred $547 million in asset retirement costs in 2005, most of which was attributed to the hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico escalating our abandonment obligations. The Company spent $39 million on acquisitions in 2005 compared to $1.1 billion in 2004, as the high price commodity market in 2005 limited the number of attractive acquisition opportunities. Those that were pursued closed in the first quarter of 2006. Acquisition expenditures typically vary year to year based on the availability of opportunities that fit Apaches overall strategy. For 2007, we plan another active year of drilling. Because we revise our estimates of exploration and development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry conditions, year to year results and the relative levels of commodity prices and service costs, accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best. At the end of 2006 we had a fairly active drilling program underway; however, if commodity prices soften and service costs do not decline accordingly, Apache will not hesitate to reduce activity until margins are back in line. Our 2007 preliminary estimate of exploration and development capital and oil and gas processing facilities and pipelines is approximately $4.5 billion. We generally do not project estimates for acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable. We continually look for properties in which we believe we can add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise. Cash Dividend Payments The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 42 consecutive years through 2006. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. Common dividends paid during 2006 rose 33 percent to $148 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend 50 percent, to 15 cents per share from 10 cents per share, effective with the November 2006 dividend payment. During 2006 and 2005, Apache paid a total of $6 million in dividends each year on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. See Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Common dividends paid during 2005 rose 32 percent to $112 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. Contractual Obligations We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following 38 table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations.

The Company records a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation. See Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further discussion. (b) This table does not include the Companys pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further discussion. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations including approximately $17 million for environmental remediation and approximately $7 million for various legal liabilities, in addition to the $71 million, plus interest, we accrued for the Texaco China B.V. litigation. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies. The Company accrued approximately $34 million as of December 31, 2006, for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a member of this insurance pool which insures specific property, pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential termination fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required. As discussed under Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in this Form 10 K, Apache assumed obligations for pre existing volumetric production payments (VPPs) in the 2004 acquisition of properties from Anadarko and the 2003 acquisition of properties from Shell. Under the terms of the VPP agreements, Apache is scheduled to deliver a total of 4.7 MMboe in 2007 and 1.6 MMboe in 2008 to Morgan Stanley as owner of the VPP interests. Morgan Stanley is entitled to the first production and may demand up to 90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by each VPP in any given month to satisfy the VPP interests. However, they have no right to look to other assets or production of Apache beyond that encumbered in the acquisition. Apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the VPPs. As of December 31, 2006, Apache has booked a total of 87.4 MMboe of reserves attributable to the Anadarko and Shell transactions. The VPPs are non operating interests, 39 free of costs incurred for operations and production. Apache provided a liability for these costs as reflected in the preceding table. Upon closing of our 2003 acquisition of the North Sea properties, Apache assumed BPs abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, did not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache fails to satisfy the abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to ensure Apaches payment of these costs, Apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moodys and Standard and Poors from the Companys current ratings of A3 and A , respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change. If Apache is required to provide a letter of credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level. The letter of credit amount would be 134 million British pounds, an amount that represents the letter of credit requirement through March 2008, and will be negotiated annually based on Apaches future abandonment obligation estimates. The Companys future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys. The Companys credit facilities do not require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating. The negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail under Capital Resources and Liquidity, Debt in this section of this Form 10 K. In addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements, Apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the Companys credit ratings decline significantly. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions. Apache entered into a partnership with ExxonMobil to obtain additional interests in specific West Texas and New Mexico oil and gas properties acquired from ExxonMobil in September 2004. Apache concluded that they were not the primary beneficiary of the partnership and, therefore, proportionately consolidated only the Companys portion of the oil and gas properties. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Full Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Operations The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful efforts method, costs such as geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred, where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the net book value (full cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period (ceiling limitation). If the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation, the excess amount is charged through income. We have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these finding activities. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and 40 developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments. Generally, the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting. Reserve Estimates Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production sharing arrangements utilizing the economic interest method, which excludes the host countrys share of reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. As such, our reserve engineers review and revise the Companys reserve estimates at least annually. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, their review covered 75, 74 and 79 percent of the reserve value, respectively. Costs Excluded Under the full cost method of accounting, oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects. Apache excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the Companys accounting, exploration and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred. Nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the Companys exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling individual wells. If geological and geophysical (G&G) costs cannot be associated with specific properties, they are included in the amortization base as incurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for that country. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play. This evaluation considers among other factors, seismic data, requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital plans, and political, economic, and market conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings. Our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. 41 Beginning in 2001, we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and gas sales. Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt lessened the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in a one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. During 2006, we experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts. We have not established a reserve for these Egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid, albeit late, and have no indication that we will not be able to collect our receivable. Asset Retirement Obligation The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing Asset Retirement Obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Income Taxes Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in six countries. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established, and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the Companys tax returns. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. Derivatives Apache uses derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign currency volatility. The Company accounts for the contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The estimated fair values of Apaches derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. For oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. For foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs. SFAS No. 133 requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be marked to market and reported in current period income, rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. Realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in Other under Revenues and Other of the Statement of Consolidated Operations. 42 The fair value estimate of Apaches derivative contracts requires judgment; however, the Companys derivative contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data. Option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Commodity Risk in this Form 10 K for commodity price sensitivity information and the Companys policies related to the use of derivatives. Stock Based Compensation Consistent with the Companys desire to reflect the ultimate cost of stock based compensation on the income statement, Apache early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 R Share Based Payment upon the FASBs issuance of the revised statement in the fourth quarter 2004. Stock based compensation awards that vest during the year are reflected in the Companys net income. Awards granted in future periods will be valued on the date of grant and expensed using a straight line basis over the required service period. The Company chose to adopt the statement under the Modified Retrospective approach as prescribed under SFAS No. 123 R. Under this approach, the Company is required to expense all options and stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the stock compensation determined on the date of grant. Had the Company not early adopted SFAS No. 123 R under this transition approach, 2004 net income would have been lower by $89 million ($56 million after tax) or $.17 per diluted share. Normally, net income would be negatively impacted by adopting SFAS No. 123 R under this transition method. However, the Companys 2000 Share Appreciation Plan, which triggered in 2004, has a fair market value based expense recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 R that is substantially less than the intrinsic value cost that would have been recorded under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. Please refer to Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a detailed description of the 2000 Share Appreciation Plan and costs associated with our stock compensation plans. Also, inherent in expensing stock options and other stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123 R are several judgments and estimates that must be made. These include determining the underlying valuation methodology for stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation, such as the Companys expected stock price volatility, expected term of the employee option, expected dividend yield, the expected risk free interest rate, the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option. Changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant. For option valuations, Apache utilizes the Black Scholes option pricing model. For valuing the Share Appreciation Plan awards, the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation model developed by a third party. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity Risk The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly average oil price realizations, including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges, ranged from a low of $52.64 per barrel to a high of $68.59 per barrel during 2006. Average gas price realizations, including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges, ranged from a monthly low of $3.85 per Mcf to a monthly high of $8.05 per Mcf during the same period. Based on the Companys 2006 worldwide oil and gas production levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by $82 million and a $.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by $55 million. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes do not exceed 43 the ceiling. This ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this ceiling, the excess is charged to additional DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities; however, as discussed above, sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Apache has historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions; however, in 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized management to hedge a portion of production generated from the Companys drilling program. In 2006, financial derivative hedges represented approximately eight percent of the total worldwide natural gas and nine percent of the total worldwide crude oil production. At year end, hedges in place were primarily related to North America production and represent approximately 12 percent of worldwide production for natural gas and crude oil. On December 31, 2006, the Company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of $87 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately $58 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately $60 million. The Company also had open crude oil derivative positions with a fair value of $40 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would reduce the fair value by approximately $104 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately $107 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2006. See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for notional volumes and terms associated with the Companys derivative contracts. Apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Treasurer and other key members of Apaches management, approve and oversee these controls, which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit, limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Governmental Risk Apaches U.S. and international operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state and local laws and regulations impacting production levels, taxes, environmental requirements and other assessments including a potential Windfall Profits Tax. Weather and Climate Risk Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. While our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance program, and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of the weather, not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated or insured against. In response to large underwriting losses caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the insurance industry has reduced capacity for windstorm damage and substantially increased premium rates. As a result, there is no 44 assurance that Apache will be able to arrange insurance to cover fully its Gulf of Mexico exposures at a reasonable cost when the current policies expire. Foreign Currency Risk The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts. Over half the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in Australian dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In contrast, all oil and gas production in Egypt is sold for U.S. dollars and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentina revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars but translated into pesos at the then current exchange rate. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds or Argentine pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date. Foreign currency gains and losses also come about when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. A 10 percent strengthening or weakening of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Egyptian pound, or Argentine peso as of December 31, 2006, would result in a foreign currency net loss or gain of approximately $112 million. Interest Rate Risk On December 31, 2006, the Companys debt with fixed interest rates represented approximately 57 percent of total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately 43 percent of Apaches debt will fluctuate based on short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating interest rates on year end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately $9.2 million. Forward Looking Statements and Risk Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, capital expenditure projections, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
