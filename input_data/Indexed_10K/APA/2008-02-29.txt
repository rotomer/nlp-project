ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion. Executive Overview Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is one of the largest independent (non integrated) oil and natural gas upstream companies in the United States (U.S.). At Apache, we strive to generate competitive returns and build a profitable oil and gas company for the long term benefit of our shareholders using the following strategy: Build a balanced portfolio of assets which provides a platform for profitable growth through drilling and acquisitions across the cycles of our dynamic industry; Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet; and Maximize cash flow and earnings from each unit of production by controlling administrative, operating and capital costs. A key part of our strategy is balancing our portfolio through diversity of geological risk, political risk, hydrocarbon mix (crude oil versus natural gas) and reserve life in order to achieve consistency in results. Our portfolio of geographic locations provides variation of all of these factors and, additionally, in the case of Australia and Argentina, the potential for increasing the value of our investments through rising natural gas prices. We currently have operations in the United States (Central and Gulf Coast regions), Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea, Australia and Argentina. We are finalizing contracts for two exploration blocks in Chile. Each region has a significant producing asset base as well as large undeveloped acreage positions which 21 provide room for growth. In 2007, no single region contributed more than 26 percent of our production or reserves. We seek to maintain diversity of reserve life, which translates into balance in the timing of returns on our investments. Reserve life (estimated reserves divided by annual production) in our regions ranges from as short as six years to as long as 20 years. By maintaining a balanced hydrocarbon mix, we are protecting against price deterioration in a given product while retaining upside potential through a significant increase in either commodity price. For example, in 2007, oil and liquids provided 47 percent of our production, but 65 percent of our total oil and gas revenues. We were well positioned to realize the benefit of higher oil prices, which significantly outpaced natural gas price increases. At year end, our estimated proved reserves were also balanced at 54 percent natural gas and 46 percent crude oil and liquids. Additionally, in each region, we have attained a critical mass that supports sustainable lower risk drilling opportunities, balanced by higher risk, higher reward exploration. In 2007, we drilled, or participated in, 1,101 gross wells with an overall 87 percent success rate; 89 percent were developmental and 11 percent exploratory. We believe our balanced portfolio strategy enhances our ability to deliver long term production growth, increase proved reserves at a reasonable economic cost and achieve competitive investment rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders. Our management and incentive systems underscore high cash flow and appropriate risk taking to reach or exceed targeted hurdle rates of return on invested capital. These are measured monthly, reviewed with management quarterly and utilized to determine annual performance awards. We review capital allocations, at least quarterly, through a disciplined and focused process of reviewing internally generated drilling prospects, opportunities for tactical acquisitions, land positions with additional drilling prospects or, occasionally, new core areas which could enhance our portfolio. We continue to deliver strong results with 2007 return on capital employed and return on equity of 16 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Also in 2007, we increased reserves for the 22nd consecutive year and production for the 28th of the last 29 years, a testament to our balanced portfolio approach. We periodically evaluate our properties to determine whether sales of certain assets could provide opportunities to redeploy our capital resources to rebalance our portfolio and enhance prospective returns. As a result of this process, in 2007 we sold non strategic oil and gas properties located in northwest Louisiana for approximately $56 million and contracted to sell others for approximately $309 million. The assets under contract are expected to close in the first quarter of 2008. Preserving financial flexibility is key to our overall business philosophy. We ended 2007 with a year end debt to capitalization ratio of 22 percent, despite current year capital investments of $5.8 billion, excluding asset retirement costs. In tightening credit markets, Apaches single A debt ratings provide a competitive advantage in accessing capital. The third critical component of our overall strategy is maximization of earnings and cash flow. Both are significantly impacted by commodity prices, our ability to economically add reserves through drilling and acquisitions, and controlling costs to add and produce reserves. Commodity prices fluctuate and are influenced by factors beyond our control, including worldwide supply and demand, political stability and governmental actions and regulations. While historically high prices have increased our oil and gas revenues in 2007, they also led to increased industry competition and consequently rising costs. Drilling, operating and administrative costs continue to increase from both inflationary pressures from higher commodity prices and the weakened U.S. dollar. We have experienced additional cost increases, particularly in the U.S., with higher demand resulting from activity to repair damage caused by the 2005 Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. Increased demand for producing oil and gas properties has also resulted in higher acquisition prices. We closely monitor drilling and acquisition cost trends in each of our core areas relative to product prices and, when appropriate, adjust our capital budgets accordingly. In addition, we 22 actively seek to identify and pursue alternatives to maintain efficient levels of costs and expenses. Despite pressure from rising costs, 2007 pre tax margins were our second highest on record. We calculate pre tax margins as follows: Pre tax Margins 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except margin) Income before Income Taxes $ 4,672,612 $ 4,009,595 $ 4,206,254 Barrels of oil equivalent produced 204,852 182,913 165,890 Margin per boe produced $ 22.81 $ 21.92 $ 25.36 Operating Highlights We made considerable operational progress during the year which we believe adds to our platform for long term profitable growth. Key operational highlights include: U.S. Central Our $1 billion acquisition of producing properties in the Permian basin of West Texas and a successful drilling program contributed to another year of growth with productions and reserves increasing 17 and 15 percent, respectively. These acquired properties had an estimated 70 MMboe at the end of 2006 and compliment our existing long lived Permian basin assets. U.S. Gulf Coast In September 2007, we executed a farm in agreement securing exploration and development opportunities in deep rights below the Austin chalk on approximately 400,000 net acres. Our Gulf Coast region increased daily equivalent production 25 percent upon restoration of final production outages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, successful drilling and recompletion programs and a full year of production from properties acquired in June 2006. Canada We drilled and tested one horizontal well and conducted long term production tests on two vertical wells in our Ootla shale gas play in British Columbia. Encouraged by our results, we acquired additional acreage in the play during the year, bringing our total position to 400,000 gross (200,000 net) acres. Egypt We doubled our acreage position with a 50 percent interest in four new concessions, adding 10.5 million gross acres of exploration potential. Progress is being made on our Salam gas plant expansion, which should be completed by the end of 2008, adding approximately 90 to 100 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) and 4,500 barrels per day (b/d) of capacity net to Apache. We also continued expansion of several waterflood projects with further drilling and increased water injection capacity. Australia In 2007 we announced discoveries in the Julimar, Julimar East and Brunello fields on Australias Northwest Shelf. The discovery which could potentially be the largest field ever found by Apache, will be further appraised in 2008. We own a 65 percent working interest in the Julimar Brunello complex. The Pyrenees development, operated by BHP Billiton (BHP), was sanctioned in 2007. Construction will begin in 2008 with development drilling to start in early 2009. This project is expected to commence production in early 2010 at an estimated net rate of 20,000 b/d. We executed a contract for a Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO) that will be used in the $500 million Van Gogh development in Western Australias Exmouth Basin. We own 52.5 percent of the development, which was sanctioned in 2007. Production is expected to come online in 2009, adding an estimated 20,000 b/d to our net production. 23 We sanctioned the construction of a pipeline and an onshore natural gas processing plant for our Reindeer gas project in 2007. The field is slated to begin producing in the middle of 2010 at an estimated net rate of 60 MMcf/d. In 2007 our average realized gas price increased 15 percent, or $.24 per Mcf, with considerable upward pressure on prices of newly contracted gas. North Sea Significant investments in platform upgrades continued in 2007. With production averaging almost 54,000 b/d, the Forties remains Apaches largest value field in terms of production, reserves, and cash flow. Argentina In 2007 Apache completed 1,700 square kilometers of a nearly 2,500 square kilometer 3 D seismic mega shoot in Tierra del Fuego. The program will be completed in 2008. In December 2007, Apache announced that the first significant well drilled from a location identified in the three dimensional seismic survey in Tierra del Fuego began producing at a rate of approximately 1,600 b/d and 1.3 MMcf/d from the Lower Cretaceous Springhill sandstone. In 2007 our average realized gas price increased 21 percent, up $.20 per Mcf. Chile In November 2007, Apache was awarded the exploration rights on two blocks comprising one million net acres in Chile at a bid round. This acreage is adjacent to our 552,000 net acres on the Argentinean side of Tierra del Fuego and represents a natural extension of our expanding exploration and production operations. Apache is finalizing the contracts with the Chilean government and plans to begin shooting 3 D seismic in 2008. Financial Highlights In 2007, records were achieved in the key financial measures of earnings, cash flow, revenues, production and year end estimated reserves. Financial highlights for 2007 relative to 2006 include: Record earnings of $2.8 billion, up 10 percent. Record cash provided by operating activities of $5.7 billion, up 32 percent. Record oil and gas revenues of $10 billion, up 23 percent. Record production of 561,239 boe per day, up 12 percent. Record oil prices averaged $68.84 per bbl, up 15 percent; gas prices averaged $5.34 per Mcf, up three percent. Capital expenditures totaled $5.8 billion; including $4.3 billion for exploration and development (excluding asset retirement obligations), $1 billion for acquisitions and $473 million for gathering, transmission and processing facilities. Record estimated reserves of 2.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up six percent. 24 Results of Operations Revenues For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Contribution 2006 Contribution 2005 Contribution Revenues (in thousands): Oil $ 6,259,125 63 % $ 4,911,861 61 % $ 4,413,934 59 % Natural gas 3,503,817 35 % 3,001,246 37 % 2,928,578 39 % Natural gas liquids 199,040 2 % 161,146 2 % 114,779 2 % Total $ 9,961,982 100 % $ 8,074,253 100 % $ 7,457,291 100 % Oil and Natural Gas Prices Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Given the current tightly balanced market, small variations in either supply, demand, or both, can have dramatic effects on prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while other economic factors could impact demand. While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a worldwide market. Generally, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil move in the same direction. Apache manages a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices using financial instruments. In Argentina, we are currently selling our oil in the domestic market. The government imposed a sliding scale tax on oil exports which effectively limits the amount we are able to receive in the domestic market to a parity price equivalent to the price of exported crude oil after adjusting for export taxes. Effective November 19, 2007, the export tax regulations were further modified and now include a cap of $42.00 per barrel when WTI is $60.90 or greater. In TdF, the price cap applies but Apache retains the 21 percent Value Added Tax collected from buyers, effectively increasing realized prices. Natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is more subject to local supply and demand conditions. The majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing local market prices. Apache uses a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices including fixed price contracts and derivatives. Apache primarily sells natural gas into four markets: 1) North America, which has a common market and where supply and demand are currently tightly balanced; creating a volatile pricing environment where most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. 2) Egypt, where the majority of our gas is sold to Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a maximum price of $2.65 per MMbtu. Apache has retained the previous gas price formula (without a price cap) until 2013 on up to 100 gross MMcf/d. 3) Australia, which has a local market with mostly long term fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in Australias consumer price index. 4) Argentina, where we receive low government regulated pricing on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category. During the year, we realized an average price of $.76 per Mcf on government regulated sales. The majority of the remaining volumes were sold at market driven prices, in excess of $2.00 per Mcf at year end. For specific marketing arrangements by segment, please refer to Item 1 and 2.

NM Not Meaningful 26 Contributions to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues The following table presents each countrys oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues, respectively. Oil Revenues Gas Revenues For the Year Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 United States 35 % 27 % 26 % 56 % 53 % 54 % Canada 8 % 9 % 10 % 26 % 30 % 34 % North America 43 % 36 % 36 % 82 % 83 % 88 % Egypt 26 % 27 % 25 % 12 % 12 % 9 % Australia 6 % 6 % 7 % 4 % 4 % 3 % North Sea 22 % 27 % 29 % Argentina 3 % 2 % 2 % 1 % Other International 2 % 3 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Year 2007 Compared to Year 2006 Crude Oil Revenues Apaches 2007 consolidated crude oil revenues totaled $6.3 billion, $1.3 billion above 2006, with nearly equal contributions from an 11 percent rise in production and a 15 percent increase in our realized oil price. On the whole, production increased an average 24,523 barrels per day (b/d), driven by the U.S. which was up 23,927 b/d. Crude oil price realizations averaged $68.84 per barrel for the year, $83.00 in the fourth quarter alone. U.S. oil revenues were up $879 million to $2.2 billion with $580 million, or two thirds of the increase, attributable to a 36 percent increase in production. A 23 percent increase in realized prices added the remaining $299 million. Gulf Coast production climbed 48 percent to 53,842 b/d, mainly on production restored from hurricane damaged properties, a full year of production from Gulf of Mexico properties acquired in June 2006 and successful drilling and recompletion activities. Central region production grew 21 percent to 36,917 b/d, with the addition of Permian basin properties acquired from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) in March 2007 and successful drilling and recompletion activities. In Egypt, crude oil revenues rose $294 million, to $1.6 billion, with increased production generating an additional $110 million of revenues. The balance of the increase in revenues, $184 million, came from a 14 percent increase in realized prices, which were up $8.91 to $72.51 per barrel. Daily production averaged 60,735 b/d, up seven percent. Production gains were associated with development drilling in the Khalda and Matruh concessions as well as the East Bahariya, Umbarka, El Diyur and North El Diyur concessions. Australias crude oil revenues of $401 million increased 35 percent, or $105 million. Production was 16 percent higher generating $55 million of the increase. Production growth resulted from an additional interest acquired in the Legendre field, completion of West Cycad wells, and increased liquids from the Bambra, Wonnich Deep, Doric and Lee gas wells. Australias price realizations rose 17 percent to $79.79 per barrel, the highest in the Company, generating an additional $50 million of revenue. Argentinas oil revenues increased $85 million to $192 million, with over 90 percent of the increase associated with 67 percent higher production. The year 2007 benefited from a full year of production from acquisitions made in 2006, as well as successful drilling, workover and recompletion activity during the year. Higher volumes added $77 million to revenues, with price increases adding $8 million. Argentinas realized oil prices averaged $45.99 per barrel, up seven percent from the prior year. North Sea oil revenues increased $41 million to $1.4 billion. Oil prices averaged $70.93 per barrel, up 13 percent, adding $168 million in revenues. Production averaged 53,632 b/d, down eight percent, reducing 27 revenues by $127 million. Production increases on three of our platforms were more than offset by declines from wells at the Alpha and Echo platforms while drilling operations were postponed for facility upgrades. Drilling operations on the Alpha platform will resume in 2008. Canadas oil revenues increased $15 million to $467 million, with a 14 percent price increase mostly offset by a nine percent decline in production. Prices averaged $68.29 per barrel, up from $59.90 in 2006. Production dropped in 2007 primarily because of natural decline resulting from a 38 percent reduction in exploration and development capital invested in Canada compared to 2006. China had no crude oil revenues in 2007 compared to $73 million in the prior year, a result of our August 2006 asset divestiture and exit from China. Natural Gas Revenues Apaches natural gas revenues increased 17 percent, or $503 million, to $3.5 billion. Higher production contributed $405 million of the additional revenues. Gas production averaged 1,796 MMcf/d, up 13 percent from 2006. Natural gas prices increased $.17 to an average $5.34 per Mcf, generating an additional $98 million in revenue. U.S. natural gas revenues grew by $385 million to nearly $2 billion. U.S. production rose 15 percent, boosting revenues $264 million. Gulf Coast production increased 16 percent, boosted by final production restoration on hurricane damaged properties, a full year of production from Gulf of Mexico properties acquired in June 2006, and successful drilling and recompletion activities. Central region production climbed 14 percent on successful drilling and recompletion activities and the addition of Permian basin properties acquired in March 2007. Higher natural gas prices, which averaged $7.04 per Mcf compared to $6.54 in 2006, added $121 million to revenues. Gas revenues in Egypt were up $53 million, to $404 million, on an 11 percent increase in production and a four percent increase in price realizations. Production gains of 23 MMcf/d boosted the regions average output to 241 MMcf/d, generating an additional $39 million in revenues. Production gains resulted from higher throughput and less downtime at the Obaiyed plant compared to 2006 and new wells in the North East Abu Gharadig (NEAG) concession. Higher prices added another $14 million. Australias natural gas revenues increased $22 million to $134 million, on higher price realizations and production gains. Price realizations improved 15 percent, adding $16 million to revenues. A five percent demand driven rise in production generated another $6 million of revenues. Argentinas natural gas revenues more than doubled to $86 million, bolstered by a full year of production from 2006 property acquisitions, successful drilling and recompletion activities and a 21 percent increase in price realizations. Production grew 89 MMcf/d, or 79 percent, generating $38 million of new revenues. The price gain added another $8 million. Canadas natural gas revenues decreased $6 million, to $892 million on a four percent decline in production. Production, which averaged 388 MMcf/d, was impacted by natural decline which more than offset increases from drilling and recompletion activities. Our exploration and development capital investment in Canada was 38 percent lower than 2006. Lower production reduced revenues by $37 million. Natural gas prices rose $.21, to $6.30 per Mcf, increasing revenues $31 million. Year 2006 Compared to Year 2005 Crude Oil Revenues Crude oil revenues in 2006 increased $498 million from 2005 to $4.9 billion. Price gains across all regions, which averaged $8.26 more per barrel than 2005, generated an additional $706 million of revenues. These additional revenues were partially offset by the effect of a four percent decline in production. All segments reported a significant increase in realized crude oil price, with Argentina, Egypt, and the U.S. also benefiting from production growth compared to 2005. Egypt generated an additional $233 million of crude oil revenue in 2006. An 18 percent increase in crude oil price realizations, generated $200 million of the additional revenues, with the remainder coming from a three percent increase in production. While Egypt experienced production growth in many areas, the predominate contributor was from drilling results at the Khalda Concession which benefited from a full year of associated condensate related to increased Qasr field gas production. 28 U.S. crude oil revenues for 2006 increased $162 million, with a 13 percent increase in crude oil price realizations contributing $151 million of the additional revenues and a small increase in 2006 oil production contributing the remaining $11 million. The third quarter 2005 hurricanes reduced Apaches 2006 average annual daily crude oil production 13,100 b/d, compared to 10,813 b/d in 2005. Shut in production reduced the Companys 2006 and 2005 crude oil revenues by approximately $297 million and $186 million, respectively. Central region production rose 18 percent, reflecting drilling and recompletion activity in the Permian basin and southeast New Mexico, and the Amerada Hess acquired properties. Gulf Coast production was 10 percent below 2005 levels with downtime, hurricane production shut ins and natural decline outpacing growth attributed to drilling and recompletion activity and the BP acquired properties. Argentinas 2006 oil revenues increased $91 million over 2005 with $89 million of the increase associated with production growth, driven primarily by acquired properties and subsequent exploitation activities. Higher oil price realizations generated the other $2 million. The North Seas 2006 crude oil revenues were $80 million higher than 2005 with $240 million of additional revenues generated from a 19 percent increase in price realizations, partially offset by lower production, which was down 11 percent on a comparative basis. Production was lower in 2006 primarily because of production interruptions associated with commissioning of major infrastructure projects and temporary unplanned shutdown of the third party Forties Pipeline System during the third quarter of 2006. The focus on upgrades in 2006 also displaced drilling operations necessary to mitigate natural decline. Canadas 2006 oil revenues increased $17 million over 2005, with $56 million of additional revenues associated with higher price realizations, partially offset by lower production, which was down eight percent. Canadian production was down in most areas as natural decline exceeded drilling and production enhancement activities. Australias 2006 crude oil revenues were $27 million less than 2005, as a 23 percent decline in production more than offset an 18 percent increase in realized price. The production decrease resulted from normal field decline which offset a full year of associated condensate production from the John Brookes field and other development activities, mainly in the Bambra, Zephyrus and Stag areas. Chinas 2006 oil revenues were $59 million less than 2005, a consequence of the August 2006 divestiture. Natural Gas Revenues Our 2006 consolidated natural gas revenues increased $73 million from the prior year with $614 million of additional revenues generated from production growth mostly offset by the effect of a 19 percent decline in realized prices. All core gas producing regions generated additional revenues in 2006 from production growth; however they were mostly offset by lower relative natural gas prices. Egypt contributed $73 million more to 2006 consolidated natural gas revenues on a 31 percent increase in production and a four percent decrease in realized gas prices. The year over year production growth came primarily from the Khalda concession, mostly attributable to a full year of production from the Qasr field. Argentinas 2006 natural gas revenues increased $38 million, with all of the additional revenues associated with production growth. As with oil, the production growth primarily came from acquired properties and subsequent exploitation activities. Australias 2006 natural gas revenues were $35 million higher than 2005. Natural gas production increases added $38 million to revenues, while lower gas price realizations reduced revenues $3 million. The additional production was attributed to a full year of production from the John Brookes field. U.S. natural gas revenues were $17 million higher in 2006. U.S. natural gas production, up 12 percent, contributed $166 million of additional revenues, while a nine percent price decline lowered revenues $149 million. The 2005 hurricanes reduced Apaches 2006 average annual daily natural gas production 37 MMcf/d compared to 59 MMcf/d in 2005. Shut in production from the hurricanes reduced the Companys 2006 and 2005 natural gas revenues by approximately $95 million and $211 million, respectively. Central region production rose 16 percent from 2005, benefiting from drilling and recompletion activity, primarily in central and western Oklahoma, in East Texas and from acquired properties. Gulf Coast region production was nine percent above 2005 levels on the BP 29 acquired properties, hurricane restoration, and drilling and recompletion activity, principally in the Chauvin, Ship Shoal and South Timbalier fields. Canadas 2006 natural gas revenues decreased $91 million from 2005. An additional $72 million of revenues generated from a nine percent increase in production were more than offset by the impact of a 16 percent decrease in realized natural gas prices. Canadas production growth was concentrated in the North and South Grant Lands and Kabob areas, with activity in other areas more than offset by natural decline. Costs The table below compares our costs on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference either expenses on a boe basis or expenses on an absolute dollar basis, or both, depending on their relevance. Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) (Per boe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment $ 2,208 $ 1,699 $ 1,325 $ 10.78 $ 9.29 $ 7.99 Other assets 140 118 91 .68 .64 .55 Asset retirement obligation accretion 96 89 54 .47 .48 .32 Lease operating expenses 1,706 1,362 1,041 8.33 7.45 6.27 Gathering and transportation 118 104 100 .58 .57 .60 Severance and other taxes 542 554 453 2.65 3.03 2.73 General and administrative expenses 275 211 198 1.34 1.16 1.20 Financing costs, net 220 142 116 1.07 .78 .70 Total $ 5,305 $ 4,279 $ 3,378 $ 25.90 $ 23.40 $ 20.36 Year 2007 Compared to Year 2006 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DDA) The following table details the changes in DDA of oil and gas properties between 2007 and 2006. DDA (In millions) 2006 $ 1,699 Volume change 210 Rate change 299 2007 $ 2,208 Full cost DDA expense totaled $2.2 billion, $509 million more than 2006. Production growth drove $210 million of the increase; the remainder is a consequence of higher costs. DDA per boe averaged $10.78, $1.49 higher than 2006 as the costs to acquire, find and develop reserves continued to exceed our historical cost basis. Increasing costs also impact our estimates for future development of known reserves and estimates to abandon properties, both of which impact our full cost depletion rate. DDA on other assets increased $22 million to $140 million with facilities coming online, in Canada, Egypt and the U.S. A full year of DDA on assets acquired during 2006 in Argentina also contributed to the year over year increase. Lease Operating Expenses (LOE) LOE is comprised of several components: direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, ad valorem taxes, and workover costs. Direct operating costs are generally driven by commodity price levels, the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e. offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc). Rising commodity prices impact operating cost 30 elements directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals which are commodity price based. Other items such as labor, boats, helicopters and materials and supplies are indirectly impacted as high prices increase activity and demand and thus, costs. Our operating costs increased 12 percent in 2007 and 19 percent in 2006 when compared to the prior year driven by increasing commodity prices. Our average realized commodity price per boe for 2007 was 10 percent higher than 2006, eight percent higher than 2005, and 50 percent higher than 2004. Oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Oil and liquids were 47 percent of our production in both 2007 and 2006. A significant portion of our ad valorem taxes are reserve based and increase when prices rise. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote plants and facilities. All production in Australia and the North Sea and over 80 percent from the U.S. Gulf Coast region is from offshore properties. Workovers accelerate production; hence, they generally rise with commodity prices. In addition, workover activity generally increases after acquisitions. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact the Companys LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding to per unit costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar lowering per unit costs in our international regions. In 2007, the U.S. dollar weakened 18, 11 and two percent relative to the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British Pound, respectively. The following discussion will focus on per unit costs which we believe to be the most meaningful measure for analyzing LOE. LOE averaged $8.33 per boe, an increase of $.88. Almost two thirds of the increase was from additional workover activity ($.16), a weakening U.S. dollar ($.16), hurricane repair activity ($.15), incentive based compensation ($.07) and ad valorem taxes ($.03). The remaining increase is the result of the inflationary impact of higher commodity prices on all other operating costs, as described above. The U.S. contributed $.45 to the $.88 per boe increase. Driving factors in the increase were additional hurricane repairs ($.15), more workover activity ($.13), acquired Permian basin oil properties which carry a higher rate than our historical average ($.05), incremental incentive based compensation with Apaches rising stock price ($.04), higher ad valorem taxes ($.03), and the inflationary impact higher commodity prices have on operating costs ($.05). Over two thirds of the increase in workover activity occurred on properties acquired in March 2007, in the Permian basin of West Texas. Canada added $.34 per boe to the consolidated rate, $.09 of which was attributed to a decline in relative production. A weakening U.S. dollar negatively impacted the rate an additional $.09. The balance of the increase related to higher levels of workover activity ($.03), higher ad valorem taxes ($.02), lease rentals ($.02), company labor ($.02) and generally higher costs. The North Sea increased the consolidated rate $.09 per boe; the net impact of a $.10 per boe increase on a decline in production volumes and a reduction of $.01 on lower costs. The benefit of decreases in diesel fuel consumption ($.08) and lower turnaround expenses more than offset increases from the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar ($.05), higher standby and supply boat costs ($.01) and higher contract labor ($.01). We are seeing the benefits of several years of facility upgrades to reduce the operating costs, including completion of our power generation ring. Australia increased the consolidated rate $.09 per boe over 2006. The increase was primarily a result of our acquisition of an additional interest in Legendre, an oil field which carries a higher cost per barrel than our existing blended Australian rate ($.06), and appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar ($.02). Two Argentine acquisitions, in April and September 2006, lowered the 2007 consolidated rate $.13 per boe. The LOE rate on these properties was lower than our existing consolidated rate. Egypt had no impact on the consolidated rate. Our 2006 exit from China increased the 2007 consolidated rate $.04 per boe. Gathering and Transportation We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third party carrier and receive a price with no 31 transportation deduction. In this case, we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. In both the U.S. and Canada, we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay transportation to a third party carrier. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements. In Argentina, we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs we paid directly to third party carriers for each of the periods presented: For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In millions) U.S. $ 38 $ 32 Canada 35 34 North Sea 27 26 Egypt 15 11 Argentina 3 1 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 118 $ 104 Total Gathering and Transportation per boe $ .58 $ .57 These costs are primarily related to the portion of natural gas in our U.S. and Canadian operations sold under arrangements where we pay transportation directly to third parties, and North Sea crude oil sales and our Egyptian crude oil exports not sold under netback arrangements. The $14 million increase was driven primarily by U.S. production growth, an increase in Egyptian crude exports not sold under netback arrangements and a full year of transportation costs paid to third parties in Argentina. Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes are primarily comprised of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties field in the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes including U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum Resources Rent tax, and various Canadian taxes including: Freehold Mineral tax, Saskatchewan Capital and Saskatchewan Resources Surtax. We also pay taxes on invoices and bank transactions in Argentina. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses: For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In millions) Severance taxes. $ 142 $ 122 U.K. PRT 346 394 Other taxes 54 38 Total Severance and Other Taxes $ 542 $ 554 Total Severance and Other Taxes per boe $ 2.65 $ 3.03 Severance and other taxes decreased $12 million, or two percent, on an absolute basis. On a per unit basis they decreased $.38, or 13 percent, reflecting the 12 percent increase in equivalent production. The increase in severance taxes was driven by higher production and prices on U.S. and Australian properties burdened by such taxes. U.K. PRT was 12 percent below 2006, largely driven by lower comparable revenues on less production and slightly 32 higher deductible costs. Deductible costs include capital expenditures, LOE, general and administrative expenses (GA), and transportation tariffs. Other taxes increased with a full year of taxes on invoice and bank transactions in Argentina. General and Administrative Expenses GA was $64 million, or $.18 per boe, higher than 2006. Incentive based compensation added $.12 per boe to the rate, a consequence of strong stock price appreciation during the year, while insurance costs added $.11 per boe, a consequence of industry wide premium increases after the 2005 hurricanes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rate stemming from higher production. Financing Costs, Net The major components of financing costs, net, include interest expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs for 2007 increased $78 million or $.29 per boe, on higher average outstanding debt balances, which offset a slightly lower average interest rate. Provision for Income Taxes The 2007 provision for income taxes was $1.9 billion, $403 million above 2006 on both higher taxable income and a higher effective tax rate. Apaches 2007 effective tax rate was 39.8 percent compared to 36.3 percent in 2006. The 2007 effective rate was impacted by a non cash charge related to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign deferred taxes. Partially offsetting this charge was an out of period benefit from Canadian federal tax rate reductions enacted in the second and fourth quarters of 2007. The 2006 effective tax rate was impacted by a charge related to retroactive application of a 10 percent increase in the oil and gas company supplemental tax enacted by the U.K, a benefit from a Canadian federal and provincial tax rate reduction enacted in the second quarter of 2006 and a gain recognized on the sale of China. Foreign currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on the 2006 rate. Year 2006 Compared to Year 2005 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization The following table details changes in DDA of oil and gas properties between 2006 and 2005: DDA (In millions) 2005 DDA $ 1,325 Volume change 150 Rate change 224 2006 DDA $ 1,699 Our 2006 full cost DDA expense totaled $1.7 billion, $374 million more than 2005. Our 2006 full cost DDA rate of $9.29 per boe was $1.30 per boe more than 2005, reflecting rising acquisition costs, higher abandonment cost estimates, rising industry wide drilling and finding costs, especially in the U.S. and Canada, and incremental future development costs associated with recent acquisitions and newly identified development projects. The increase in costs, including increased estimates of future development costs, is related to increased demand for drilling and associated services, a consequence of both higher oil and gas prices and additional demand resulting from the ongoing need to repair damage caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The increase in 2006 DDA, relative to 2005 was mitigated by a decline in Egypt resulting from the January 2006 sale of Egypts deepwater acreage. Our 2006 full cost DDA expense was $73 million lower because of the production shut in for hurricane damage. Depreciation of other assets increased $27 million in 2006, reflecting ongoing development of infrastructure in Canada that began in 2005 to accommodate development on the acquired ExxonMobil acreage, and the Qasr field support facilities in Egypt, including completion of the Tarek gas plant inter connect. Lease Operating Expenses LOE averaged $7.45 per boe in 2006, $1.18 per boe higher than 2005. The 2005 hurricanes increased our worldwide rate by $.44 per boe in 2006, a reflection of shut in production and additional expenses in excess of our insurance coverage. The remainder of the increase was driven by industry wide cost increases, as discussed above, workover activity, a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar and British Pound and higher non hurricane related repair costs in our U.S. Gulf Coast and Canadian regions. 33 The U.S. added $.63 per boe to the 2006 worldwide rate. The Central region added $.04 per boe, with production growth nearly outpacing increases in costs, while the Gulf Coast region added $.59 per boe. In addition to the impact of industry wide cost increases, activity levels soared in the Gulf of Mexico as producers continued to repair and restore production following the 2005 hurricanes. This increase in demand on top of an already tight supply market for boats, helicopters, divers, labor, equipment and parts to complete repairs, pushed costs even higher in the region. The regions 2006 LOE included approximately $26 million, or $.14 per boe, for repairs in excess of insurance coverage. The 2006 rate increase was also impacted by additional workover activity, higher insurance rates and more non hurricane repair costs, relative to 2005. Canada added $.40 per boe to the 2006 worldwide rate. Higher costs added $.46 per boe, while production growth reduced the rate $.06. The weakening U.S. dollar accounted for $.09 per boe of the increase. The balance related to a higher level of workover activity, higher repair and maintenance costs, reclamation and restoration projects undertaken during 2006 and the general rise in costs, including increases in power rates, contract labor and fuel. Egypt added $.02 to the 2006 worldwide rate as a $32 million increase in costs, including increased workover activity, was mostly offset by associated production growth. Australia reduced the 2006 worldwide rate $.11 per boe with production growth more than offsetting associated incremental operating costs. The North Sea added $.37 per boe to the 2006 consolidated rate, with approximately two thirds of the increase in rate related to lower relative production, the strengthening British Pound and an increase in pension liabilities. The balance of the increase in costs related to major 2006 turnaround activity, higher fuel rates and usage as major projects were commissioned and higher maintenance and repair activity, relative to 2005. Argentina reduced the 2006 consolidated rate $.19 per boe with production growth related to the 2006 acquisitions more than offsetting associated incremental operating costs. Gathering and Transportation The following table presents gathering and transportation costs paid directly by Apache to third party carriers for each of the periods presented: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (In millions) U.S. $ 32 $ 30 Canada 34 33 North Sea 26 28 Egypt 11 8 Argentina 1 Other International 1 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 104 $ 100 Total Gathering and Transportation per boe $ .57 $ .60 These costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our North American operations, North Sea crude oil sales and Egyptian crude oil exports. The four percent increase in costs for 2006 was driven primarily by U.S. production growth and Egyptian crude exports. 34 Severance and Other Taxes The table below presents a comparison of these expenses: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (In millions) Severance taxes. $ 122 $ 139 U.K. PRT 394 285 Other 38 29 Total Severance and Other Taxes $ 554 $ 453 Total Severance and Other Taxes per boe $ 3.03 $ 2.73 Severance and other taxes totaled $554 million in 2006, $101 million greater than 2005. U.K. PRT increased $109 million in 2006 on a six percent increase in revenue and a 21 percent decrease in qualifying deductible capital spending. Australias severance taxes declined on lower revenues associated with lower oil production. Canadas severance taxes decreased $6 million with the phase out of the federal large corporation tax. Other taxes increased $9 million on additional U.S. franchise taxes, consistent with our growth and a $5 million special profits charge levied on petroleum revenues by the Chinese government. General and Administrative Expenses GA averaged $1.16 per boe for 2006, $.04 per boe less than 2005. Absolute costs increased $13 million to $211 million. The additional cost in 2006 was primarily associated with expansion of international operations in conjunction with acquisitions and increasing insurance costs. Financing Costs, Net Net financing costs for 2006 were $26 million higher than in 2005. Gross interest expense increased $42 million in 2006 as a result of a higher average debt balance and higher short term interest rates. Capitalized interest increased $4 million, a result of a higher average unproved property balance. Interest income rose $10 million compared to 2005 on higher cash balances. Our weighted average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2006 was 6.3 percent compared to 6.7 percent on December 31, 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for 2006 totaled $1.5 billion, $125 million less than 2005. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 36.3 percent, down from 37.6 percent in 2005. The 2006 effective rate was impacted by a combination of federal and provincial tax rate reductions enacted by Canada during the second quarter of 2006, a 10 percent increase in the oil and gas company supplemental tax enacted by the U.K. during the third quarter of 2006 and the gain recognized on the sale of China, as discussed below. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on the 2006 effective tax rate. The effective income tax rate for 2006 was impacted by the gain recognized in conjunction with divestment of operations in China. The Company intends to permanently reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and as such, has not recorded U.S. income tax expense on any undistributed foreign earnings, including the gain from the China sale. Acquisitions and Divestitures 2007 Activity U.S. Gulf Coast Farm in On September 6, 2007, Apache entered into an Exploration Agreement with various EnerVest Partnerships (EVP) for an initial term of four years whereby Apache committed to spend $30 million in qualified expenditures to explore, drill, produce and market hydrocarbons from specified undeveloped formations across 400,000 net acres in Central and East Texas. Apache must spend the entire $30 million in qualified expenditures during the initial term or pay the difference as liquidated damages. U.S. Permian Basin On March 29, 2007, the Company closed its acquisition of controlling interest in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian basin of West Texas from Anadarko for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these fields had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls) of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas as of year end 2006. The Company funded the acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko entered into a joint 35 venture arrangement to effect the transaction. The Company entered into cash flow hedges for a portion of the crude oil and the natural gas production. Divestitures In 2007 we sold non strategic oil and gas properties located in northwest Louisiana for approximately $56 million. Subsequent Divestitures On January 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its 50 percent interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 369 on the outer continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to WT Offshore, Inc. for $116 million. On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of properties in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico to Vanguard Permian, LLC for $78 million. 2006 Activity U.S. Permian Basin On January 5, 2006, the Company purchased Amerada Hesss interest in eight fields located in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from $404 million to $269 million because other interest owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase a number of the properties. The settlement price at closing of $239 million was adjusted for revenues and expenditures occurring between the effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. The acquired fields had estimated proved reserves of 27 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 27 Bcf of natural gas as of year end 2005. Argentina On April 25, 2006, the Company acquired the operations of Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer) in Argentina for $675 million. The settlement price at closing, of $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and expenditures occurring between the effective date and closing date of the acquisition. The properties are located in the Neuqun, San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and had estimated net proved reserves of approximately 22 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of natural gas as of December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing plants (five operated and three non operated), 112 miles of operated pipelines in the Neuqun basin and 2,200 square miles of three dimensional (3 D) seismic data were also included in the transaction. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands): Proved property $ 501,938 Unproved property 189,500 Gas Plants 51,200 Working capital acquired, net 11,256 Asset retirement obligation (13,635 ) Deferred income tax liability (37,630 ) Cash consideration $ 702,629 On September 19, 2006, Apache acquired additional interests in (and now operates) seven concessions in the Tierra del Fuego Province from Pan American Fueguina S.R.L. (Pan American) for total consideration of $429 million. The settlement price at closing of $396 million was adjusted for normal closing items, including revenues and expenses between the effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. The total cash consideration allocated below includes working capital balances purchased, asset retirement obligations assumed and an obligation to deliver specific gas volumes in the future. The purchase price was 36 allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands): Proved property $ 289,916 Unproved property 132,000 Gas plants 12,722 Working capital acquired, net 8,929 Asset retirement obligation (1,511 ) Assumed obligation (46,000 ) Cash consideration $ 396,056 U.S. Gulf Coast In June 2006, the Company acquired the remaining producing properties of BP plc (BP) on the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from $1.3 billion for 18 producing fields to $845 million because other interest owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase five of the 18 fields. The purchase price consisted of $747 million of proved property, $42 million of unproved property and $56 million of facilities. The settlement price on the date of closing of $821 million was adjusted primarily for revenues and expenditures occurring between the April 1, 2006 effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. The acquired properties include 13 producing fields (nine of which are operated) with estimated proved reserves of 19.5 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 148 Bcf of natural gas. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. Divestitures On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 55 percent interest in the deepwater section of Egypts West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for $413 million. Apache did not have any proved reserves booked for these properties. On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block, offshore the Peoples Republic of China, to Australia based ROC Oil Company Limited for $260 million, marking Apaches exit from China. The effective date of the transaction was July 1, 2006. The Company recorded a gain of $174 million in the third quarter of 2006. 37 Capital Resources and Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for each of the three years ended December 31. The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, including accruals that are referred to elsewhere in this document. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 5,677 $ 4,313 $ 4,332 Sales of property and equipment 67 678 80 Net commercial paper and money market borrowings 1,630 Debt borrowings 2,002 Common stock issuances 44 39 26 Other 26 36 6 7,816 6,696 4,444 Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Capital expenditures 4,802 4,140 3,716 Acquisitions 1,005 2,164 Net commercial paper and money market repayments 1,425 396 Payments on debt 170 Repurchase of common stock 174 Dividends 205 154 117 Other 224 152 97 7,831 6,784 4,326 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (15 ) $ (88 ) $ 118 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flow) is our primary source of capital and liquidity. Factors affecting changes in operating cash flow are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of noncash expenses such as DDA and deferred income tax expense. As a result, our 2007 operating cash flow increased from 2006, largely from increases in net earnings, as discussed in the Results of Operations section of this report. Operating cash flow in 2006 was flat to 2005. Debt On January 26, 2007, the Company issued $500 million principal amount, $499.5 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 5.625% notes maturing January 15, 2017 and $1 billion principal amount, $993 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 6% notes maturing January 15, 2037. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apaches option, subject to a make whole premium. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Companys commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2006 in anticipation of funding our $1 billion acquisition of Permian basin properties from Anadarko which closed March 29, 2007, and for general corporate purposes. On April 16, 2007, the Company issued $500 million principal amount, $498.8 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 5.25% notes maturing April 15, 2013. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apaches option, subject to a make whole premium. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. 38 Capital Expenditures The following table details capital expenditures for each country in which we do business. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Exploration and Development: United States $ 1,630,776 $ 1,532,959 $ 1,072,040 Canada 650,676 1,056,614 1,188,096 Egypt 605,115 454,892 352,324 Australia 516,054 179,892 217,816 North Sea 537,868 329,498 489,072 Argentina 287,047 115,570 25,963 China 12,288 22,521 4,227,536 3,681,713 3,367,832 Acquisitions Oil and gas properties 1,024,956 2,428,432 39,228 Asset Retirement Costs 439,368 390,612 546,669 Capitalized Interest 75,748 61,301 56,988 Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities 473,481 248,589 392,872 Total capital expenditures $ 6,241,089 $ 6,810,647 $ 4,403,589 Exploration and Development (ED) Increases in our 2007 cash flows enabled us to invest larger amounts on ED capital projects during the year. We invested $4.2 billion on exploration and development activities in 2007, up 15 percent from 2006. Our 2006 ED capital expenditures were $314 million above 2005. In the U.S., we invested $1.6 billion on exploration and development activities in 2007. Our Gulf Coast region invested approximately $1 billion on drilling, recompletions, and platform and production support facilities, including $46 million of associated hurricane redevelopment capital in excess of insurance coverage. The region drilled 54 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and 30 wells onshore, with a 77 percent success rate, despite ongoing hurricane repair activity. The Central region had its most active year ever investing $637 million, including the drilling of 343 wells with a 98 percent success rate. The region added to its inventory of opportunities to grow production with the addition of Permian basin properties from Anadarko in the first quarter of 2007. Canadas drilling program accounted for more than 31 percent of the Companys wells drilled. The region invested $651 million in 2007 on exploration and development activities and drilled 348 wells with an 83 percent success rate. We invested $538 million in the North Sea on exploration and development drilling, recompletions and facility upgrades. Five of 16 exploration and development wells drilled during 2007 were productive. Egypt had another active and successful exploration and development program investing $605 million, drilling 192 wells at an 84 percent success rate. In Australia, we invested $516 million in exploration and development activities as we participated in drilling 28 wells, 14 exploration wells and 14 development wells. Three of the exploration wells and six of the development wells were productive for a success rate of 32 percent. In Argentina our 2007 exploration and development activities increased by $171 million over 2006 as we invested $287 million drilling 94 wells, three exploratory and 91 development, with a 98 percent success rate. Acquisitions We completed $1 billion of acquisitions in 2007 compared to $2.4 billion in 2006. Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive opportunities arise and therefore, vary from year to year. Asset Retirement Costs In 2007, we also recorded $439 million of additional asset retirement costs. The increase is primarily related to revisions of our cost estimates. The continued escalation of service costs and the high 39 level of abandonment activities in the Gulf Coast region have increased our expected obligations. Continued worldwide drilling programs and acquisition activity also contributed to the increased abandonment costs. Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities (GTP) We invested $473 million in GTP facilities in 2007 compared to $249 million in 2006. In Egypt we invested $422 million on the expansion of gas processing facilities to alleviate the processing capacity bottleneck throttling deliverability. In Canada, we invested $24 million in processing plants. 2008 Outlook We plan another active year of drilling. Because we revise our estimates of exploration and development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry conditions, year to year results and the relative levels of commodity prices and service costs, accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best. At the end of 2007, we had a fairly active drilling program underway; however, if commodity prices soften and service costs do not decline accordingly, Apache will not hesitate to reduce activity until margins are back in line. Conversely, should commodity prices increase we may increase 2008 expenditures accordingly. Our 2008 preliminary plan includes exploration and development capital of approximately $4.6 billion and GTP of approximately $400 million. We generally do not project estimates for acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable. We continually look for properties in which we believe we can add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise. Debt Repayment The $170 million Apache Finance Pty Ltd (Apache Finance Australia) 6.5% notes matured on December 17, 2007. The notes were repaid using funds borrowed on Apaches commercial paper program. Repurchases of Common Stock On April 19, 2006, the Company announced that its board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 million shares of the Companys common stock representing a market value of approximately $1 billion on the date of announcement. The Company may buy shares from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or a combination of both. The timing and amounts of any purchases will be at the discretion of Apaches management. The Company initiated the purchase program on May 1, 2006, after the Companys first quarter 2006 earnings information was disseminated in the market. During 2006, the Company purchased 2,500,000 shares at an average price of $69.74 per share. No stock purchases were made in 2007. Dividends The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 43 consecutive years through 2007. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. Common dividends paid during 2007 rose 34 percent to $199 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend 50 percent, to 15 cents per share from 10 cents per share, effective with the November 2006 dividend payment. Common dividends paid during 2006 rose 33 percent to $148 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. During 2007 and 2006, Apache paid a total of $6 million in dividends each year on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. See Note 7 Capital Stock of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Liquidity At December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Millions of dollars except as indicated Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,677 $ 4,313 $ 4,332 Total debt 4,227 3,822 2,192 Shareholders equity 15,378 13,191 10,541 Percent of total debt to capitalization 22 % 22 % 17 % Floating rate debt/total debt 5 % 43 % In recent years, our primary sources of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow. Additionally, we maintain revolving credit facilities and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow. Other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity 40 securities and long term debt. During 2006, another source of liquidity was the divestiture of our assets in China. We expect the combination of these sources of capital will be more than adequate to fund costs and expenses necessary to maintain continued operations, future capital expenditures, payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt, dividends and other contractual obligations as discussed later in this section. Operating Cash Flow Historically, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Companys short term changes in cash provided by operating activities. Sales volume changes have also impacted operating cash flow in the short term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Apaches long term operating cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will shrink. Cash investments are continuously required to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves. See Item 1 and 2, Business and Properties, Risks Factors, in this Form 10 K. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production will be highly dependent upon having adequate capital resources available, success in both exploration and development activities and acquiring additional reserves. Our 2007 year end reserve life index indicates an average decline of 8.4 percent per year. This projection is based on production and prices at year end 2007, except in those instances where future natural gas and oil sales are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or lower prices, estimates of investments required to develop estimated proved undeveloped reserves, and costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in Note 12 Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. Debt and Credit Facilities Year end 2007 outstanding current and long term debt totaled $4.2 billion, $405 million higher than year end 2006. The Companys outstanding debt consists of notes, debentures, commercial paper and uncommitted bank lines maturing intermittently in years 2008 through 2096. Debt due in 2008 includes $135 million of commercial paper, $80 million of money market lines of credit and a small note. Apaches commercial paper is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under committed credit facilities which expire in 2012. In 2009, $100 million in debt matures with the remaining $3.9 billion maturing thereafter. On April 30, 2007, the Company amended its existing $1.5 billion U.S. five year revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date one year to May 28, 2012. The amendment also allows the Company to increase the size of the facility by up to $750 million by adding commitments from new or existing lenders. The Company also amended its $450 million U.S. credit facility, $150 million Australian credit facility and $150 million Canadian credit facility to extend the maturity dates of all the commitments to May 12, 2012. The amendment also allows the Company to increase the size of the U.S. facility by up to $250 million, the Australian facility by up to $150 million and the Canadian facility by up to $150 million by adding commitments from new or existing lenders. As detailed above, the Company currently has $2.25 billion of syndicated bank credit facilities. The available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities at December 31, 2007, after netting outstanding commercial paper, was $2.1 billion. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the Companys consolidated assets, which approximated $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2007. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group. There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the 41 lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2007. Credit Ratings Apaches senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated A3 by Moodys, A by Standard Poors and A by Fitch. Apaches short term debt rating for its commercial paper program is currently P 2 by Moodys, A 2 by Standard Poors and F1 by Fitch. The outlook is stable from all three rating agencies. Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures We fund exploration and development activities primarily through net cash provided by operating activities and budget capital expenditures based on projected operating cash flow. Our operating cash flow, both in the short and long term, is impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, management primarily relies on annual operating cash flow forecasts. Longer term operating cash flow and capital spending projections are rarely used by management to operate the business. Annual operating cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to these adjusted operating cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs. We use a combination of our operating cash flow, borrowings under the our lines of credit and commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund significant acquisitions. Contractual Obligations We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007. See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations.

See Note 6 Income Taxes of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for further discussion. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations including approximately $28 million for environmental remediation and approximately $7 million for various legal liabilities. See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies. The Company also accrued approximately $41 million as of December 31, 2007, for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a member of this insurance pool which insures specific property, pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential termination fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apaches financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of Apaches most critical accounting policies: Full Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Operations The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful efforts method, costs such as GG, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred, where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the net book value (full cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period (ceiling limitation). If the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation, the excess amount is charged through income. 43 We have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these finding activities. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments. Generally, the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and higher DDA rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting. Reserve Estimates Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production sharing arrangements utilizing the economic interest method, which excludes the host countrys share of reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. As such, our reserve engineers review and revise the Companys reserve estimates at least annually. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DDA expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. Costs Excluded Under the full cost method of accounting, oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized (amortization base). These amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects. Apache excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the Companys accounting, exploration and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred. Nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the Companys exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred to the amortization base upon completion of drilling individual wells. If geological and geophysical (GG) costs cannot be associated with specific properties, they are included in the amortization base as incurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the amortization base or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments transferred to the amortization base increase the DDA rate for that country. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play. This evaluation considers among other factors, seismic data, requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital plans, and political, economic, and market conditions. Impairments We assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of acreage. When impairment occurs, costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. 44 Impairments in international areas without proved reserves are charged to earnings upon determination that impairment has occurred. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings. Our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. Beginning in 2001, we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and gas sales. During 2007, we experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts. We have not established a reserve for these Egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid, albeit late, and have no indication that we will not be able to collect our receivable. Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. ARO, associated with retiring tangible long lived assets are recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Income Taxes Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in six countries. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established, and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the Companys tax returns. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. Derivatives Apache uses derivative contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign currency volatility. The Company accounts for the contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The estimated fair values of Apaches derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. For oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. For foreign currency forward contracts 45 designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs. SFAS No. 133 requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be marked to market and reported in current period income, rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. Realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in Other under Revenues and Other of the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The fair value estimate of Apaches derivative contracts requires judgment; however, the Companys derivative contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data. Option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Commodity Risk in this Form 10 K for commodity price sensitivity information and the Companys policies related to the use of derivatives. Stock Based Compensation Stock compensation awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight line basis over the required service period. Inherent in expensing stock options and other stock based compensation are several judgments and estimates that must be made. These include determining the underlying valuation methodology for stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation, such as the Companys expected stock price volatility, expected term of the employee option, expected dividend yield, the expected risk free interest rate, the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option. Changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant. For option valuations, Apache utilizes the Black Scholes option pricing model. For valuing the Share Appreciation Plan awards, the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation model developed by a third party. Please refer to Note 7 Capital Stock of Item 15 of this Form 10 K for a detailed description of our stock compensation plans. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates, foreign currency, weather and climate, and governmental risks. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Commodity Risk We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Apache historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions; however, in 2006 and 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized management to hedge a portion of production generated from the Companys drilling program. Approximately 17 percent of 2007 natural gas and crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges. On December 31, 2007, the Company had open natural gas derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of $59 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately $59 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately $68 million. The Company also had open oil derivatives in a liability position with a fair value of $699 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would increase the liability by approximately $402 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would 46 decrease the liability by approximately $368 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2007. See Note 3 Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for notional volumes and terms associated with the Companys derivative contracts. Apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Treasurer and other key members of Apaches management, approve and oversee these controls, which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit, limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Interest Rate Risk On December 31, 2007, the Companys debt with fixed interest rates represented approximately 95 percent of total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately 5 percent of Apaches debt will fluctuate based on short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating interest rates on year end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately $1.8 million. Foreign Currency Risk The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and the majority of the gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts. Over half the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in U.S. dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred are paid in U.K. pounds. In Egypt, all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars, but converted into Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds and Argentine pesos are converted to U.S. dollars equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of Other under Revenues and Other, or, as is the case when we re measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Companys provision for income tax expense on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Weather and Climate Risk Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or cyclones offshore Australia which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. While our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance program, and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of the weather, not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated or insured against. Governmental Risk Apaches U.S. and international operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, local and provincial laws and regulations impacting production levels, taxes, environmental requirements and other assessments including a potential Windfall Profits Tax. See Item 1A Risk Factors, for further discussion. 47 Forward Looking Statements and Risk Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, capital expenditure projections, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
