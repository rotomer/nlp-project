ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops and produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In North America, our exploration and production operations are focused in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the Permian basin, the Anadarko basin and the Western Sedimentary basin of Canada. Outside of North America, we have exploration and production operations onshore Egypt, offshore Western Australia, offshore the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the North Sea (North Sea), and onshore Argentina. We also have exploration interests on the Chilean side of the island of Tierra del Fuego. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, and the Risk Factors information, which are set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Overview Apaches 2008 results were significantly impacted by several events: A drop in demand related to the slowing global economy caused fourth quarter oil and gas prices to drop sharply. Two major uncontrollable events curtailed our production: hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and an explosion on a pipeline that transports all of our gas production in Australia. A non cash write down of the carrying value of our U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canadian and Argentine proved oil and gas properties, necessitated by low commodity prices in effect at year end (discussed below). Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices The oil and gas industry as a whole experienced a year of extremes during 2008. Crude oil and natural gas prices climbed precipitously in the first half of the year, only to pull back in the third quarter before collapsing in the fourth quarter. Apache monthly average realized prices during the summer reached $118.38 per barrel and $9.12 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). Our December average realized prices were $36.45 per barrel and $4.75 per Mcf. February 2009 indices indicate that prices are trending below Decembers averages as the global economy and demand continue to weaken. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production Apaches 2008 consolidated production declined five percent from 2007 on a barrel of oil equivalent (boe) basis. Our production would have increased over 2007 levels had it not been for the impact of the following: U.S. production was affected by wells shut in because of, and damage caused by, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. While we plan to restore nearly all of the production during the second quarter of 2009, the timing in many instances is pipeline dependent and, therefore, beyond our control. See Operating Highlights in this Item 7. In June 2008, a pipeline explosion at the Varanus Island gas processing and transportation hub offshore Western Australia disrupted gas and oil sales, reducing 2008 production. We plan to have all of the volumes restored in the first half of 2009. See Operating Highlights in this Item 7. Earnings and Cash Flow From an earnings perspective, we had our historical best and worst quarters ever, just one quarter apart. The fourth quarter price collapse and associated $3.6 billion non cash after tax write down nearly eliminated 2008 nine month earnings that totaled $3.7 billion dollars or $10.84 per common diluted share. The write down reduced earnings for the year to $706 million, or $2.09 per share. 24 Table of Contents Record commodity prices in the first half of 2008 drove record cash provided by operating activities of $7.1 billion and record oil and gas revenues of $12.4 billion, both of which were unaffected by the write down. They were, however, affected by falling commodity prices, most notably in the fourth quarter of 2008. Key financial indicators for each quarter and the year of 2008 are noted below: 2008 Key Financial Indicators, by Quarter First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Full Year (In thousands, except realized price) Oil and Gas Revenues $ 3,177,949 $ 3,904,118 $ 3,368,882 $ 1,876,890 $ 12,327,839 Average Realized Oil Price $ 89.25 $ 110.32 $ 101.04 $ 50.69 $ 87.80 Average Realized Gas Price $ 6.42 $ 8.09 $ 7.43 $ 4.76 $ 6.70 Income Attributable to Common Stock $ 1,020,093 $ 1,443,809 $ 1,189,405 $ *(2,947,033 ) $ *706,274 Cash from operating activities $ 1,808,404 $ 1,929,509 $ 2,290,655 $ 1,036,776 $ 7,065,344 * Includes a $3.6 billion (after tax) non cash write down in the carrying value of oil and gas properties. Operating and Drilling Costs Costs were a challenge for Apache and our industry in 2008 and are expected to remain so in 2009. Drilling, service and acquisition costs, which have increased steadily since the industrys last downturn in 2001, reached unprecedented levels in 2008. Also, in the U.S., activity to repair damage caused by Gulf of Mexico hurricanes over the last few years has contributed to increased demand and costs. Even though we have seen a sharp drop in commodity prices, costs have fallen less rapidly pressuring operating margins. We believe costs will ultimately adjust to the current oil and gas price environment, but until they do, our operating margins and drilling costs will continue to be pressured. Financial Position and 2009 We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that will invariably present themselves in the current business environment. We enter 2009 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 23 percent, after consideration of the non cash write down. We had over $1.5 billion in cash and short term investments and $2.3 billion availability on our lines of credit at the close of the year. In a tightening credit market, we believe Apaches single A debt ratings will provide a competitive advantage in accessing capital. Our 2008 return on capital employed and return on equity were four percent and five percent, respectively, after taking into effect the $5.3 million non cash write down. In 2009, we are projecting production growth driven by multi year projects coming on line during the year (discussed below in Operational Highlights). We plan to hold our capital expenditures, currently planned at 50 percent below 2008 spending levels, in line with our operating cash flows. We will continue to monitor capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flow estimates and intend to scale back spending further should commodity prices remain at current levels or fall further. For an in depth discussion of Apaches long term growth strategy, please refer to Part 1, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties of this Form 10 K. Full Cost Accounting and 2008 Write down in Net Oil and Gas Property Assets The Company follows the full cost method of accounting as allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the full cost method of accounting, a ceiling test must be performed each quarter, for each country. The test establishes a limit (ceiling), on the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties. This carrying value (net book value and the related deferred income taxes) may not exceed the ceiling. The ceiling limitation is the estimated after tax future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, excluding future 25 Table of Contents expected cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance sheet. The estimate of after tax future net cash flows is discounted at 10 percent per annum and calculated using both commodity prices and costs in effect at the end of the period, held flat for the life of the properties, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms or by derivative instruments that qualify, and are accounted for, as cash flow hedges. If capitalized costs (carrying value) exceed this limit, the excess is charged to expense and reflected as additional Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization (DDA) during the period. In December 2008, the SEC released the final rule for Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, which will permit reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior 12 month period rather than year end prices. The new rule becomes effective for the quarter ended December 31, 2009. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Form 10 K. Despite record realized prices and record revenues for 2008, the low oil and gas prices in effect at the end of the year resulted in an aggregate $5.3 billion ($3.6 billion net of tax) non cash write down of the carrying value of Companys U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canadian and Argentine proved oil and gas properties. If oil and gas prices fall below year end levels, additional write downs of oil and gas properties may occur. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Form 10 K. Operating Highlights We made considerable operational progress during the year, which we believe adds to our platform for long term profitable growth in spite of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and a gas pipeline explosion at the Varanus Island gas processing and transportation hub offshore Western Australia. Key operational highlights include: U.S. Gulf Coast Gulf Coast focused on an active drilling program and restoring production impacted by the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes. In addition to drilling wells, the region also performed 358 workover and recompletion operations during 2008. Significant events affecting Gulf Coast operations include: Development Projects At Ewing Banks 826, we completed four wells during the first half of 2008 and increased production to 6,315 b/d, up from 700 b/d at the beginning of the year. We own a 100 percent working interest in the field. Exploration Projects In June 2008, we had a key discovery at the Geauxpher prospect located on Garden Banks Block 462 in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Apache generated the prospect and has a 40 percent working interest. Mariner Energy, Inc. is the designated operator of the block with a 60 percent working interest. A delineation well was drilled in December 2008, extending the productive reservoir limits. We forecast the initial discovery to be online in the second quarter of 2009. Additional potential on the block is expected to be tested by further drilling. Hurricanes During the third quarter of 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike damaged onshore and offshore production and transportation facilities in our Gulf Coast region. Although most of our offshore operated platforms escaped with minor damage, we did lose four Apache operated and two non operated platforms. Our ability to transport and process our crude oil and natural gas production was also impacted by damages to third party pipelines and processing facilities. The impact of the hurricanes on 2008 operations and results follows: Production Wells shut in as a result of the hurricanes reduced 2008 production by an estimated 54.6 MMcf/d and 6,941 b/d. A substantial part of Apaches net production shut in by the storm was restored by the end of 2008, with only 7,700 b/d and 83 MMcf/d remaining offline. While we plan to restore nearly all of the production by mid year 2009, the timing in many instances is beyond our control since we 26 Table of Contents are awaiting repairs to third party pipelines and facilities. All but approximately 1,100 boe per day of production will ultimately be restored. Financial Results The impact of the hurricanes on our 2008 financial results was an estimated $410 million of lower crude oil and natural gas revenues. We also incurred approximately $75 million of expenditures for repair, redevelopment and abandonment of properties damaged by the hurricanes. The Company anticipates an additional $170 to $190 million of costs, most of which are likely to occur in 2009. A majority of these costs will be recovered through insurance, as discussed below. Insurance Coverage The Company carries property damage insurance through Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for windstorm damage in the Gulf of Mexico of $250 million after reaching a $100 million deductible per event. The deductible will be scaled down based on the Companys working interest in the damaged properties and is anticipated to be $80 million. The $250 million in coverage will be prorated downward if total claims received by OIL for Hurricane Ike exceed their aggregate limit per event of $750 million. In December 2008, OIL indicated that losses for Hurricane Ike will likely exceed the aggregate limit by an amount that would cause insurance payments to be 80 percent of amounts claimed; however, the final percentage will not be known until all claims have been submitted to OIL. In addition, Apache has $150 million of property damage and business interruption insurance through the London market subject to a $350 million deductible that can be met with property damage and qualifying business interruption losses. Egypt In Egypt, we had a steady stream of significant discoveries during the year across basins and plays, completing 236 of 260 wells for a 91 percent success rate. The region also conducted 701 workovers and recompletions and made significant progress on the completion of several major growth projects that will underpin future production growth. Notable successes during the year include: Development Projects In the Khalda concession, two additional Salam gas processing trains, trains three and four, and an associated Apache pipeline compression project on the Western Desert Northern Gas Pipeline are forecasted to add additional net production of 100 MMcf/d and 5,000 b/d when fully operational in the second quarter of 2009. The third processing train commenced operation on December 4, 2008. Commissioning with first gas from the fourth processing train is projected to commence during the first quarter of 2009. We drilled 203 waterflood wells across several concessions during 2008, increasing gross oil production from these waterflood projects 55 percent or 27,000 b/d when compared to 2007 production levels. Also, we believe that several discoveries (discussed below) in a new area called the Heba Ridge, which is adjacent to the Asala Ridge waterflood area in the East Bahariya concession, will add significantly to our inventory of waterflood projects in the concession. Exploration Discoveries During 2008, Apache announced that the Hydra 1X exploration well in Egypts Western Desert test flowed 76.6 MMcf/d and 2,813 b/d from the Deep Jurassic and overlying AEB 6 formations. The Hydra 4X well appraised this discovery. Apache has a 100 percent contractor interest in the Shushan C concession and is in the process of negotiating a Gas Sales Agreement with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and, when completed, will file to establish a development lease. On July 30, 2008, Apache announced that the Heqet 2 well in the Greater Khalda area in Egypts Western Desert tested 2,100 b/d from the Jurassic Safa formation at a depth of 14,700 feet. We also announced that the Umbarka 174 well tested 4,300 b/d in the main AEB field in the north central portion of the Greater Khalda area. Both wells are currently producing, and development of these fields continues. In October 2008, we announced the WKAL C 1X discovery on the West Kalabsha concession. The well tested 4,746 b/d and 4.4 MMcf/d in the Jurassic Safa formation. The WKAL C 1X discovery represents the westernmost oil ever 27 Table of Contents discovered in Egypt, confirming our exploration model for this area of the Faghur Basin. Apache has a 100 percent contractor interest in both the Khalda and West Kalabsha concessions. During 2008, several new oil fields were discovered in the Bahariya formation in the East Bahariya concession. The EBAH C 1X oil discovery identified a new area called the Heba Ridge. The initial discovery and three additional development wells were drilled in the EBAH C field during 2008 and all were producing at year end. A total of 40 wells are planned to fully develop the EBAH C field. Three additional exploration discoveries in the East Bahariya concession found Bahariya oil pay in separate fields. The initial wells are expected to commence production during early 2009. Each of these discoveries will add significantly to our inventory of water flood projects in the concession. Also in 2008, the Phiops 1X exploration well on the Kalabsha development lease in the Khalda area encountered a potential 374 foot oil column with 173 feet of logged pay in a secondary objective, the Cretaceous Alam El Bueib formation. The well will be tested in early 2009 and is expected to provide a significant oil reserve addition. In early 2009, we formally announced three new December 2008 field discoveries in Egypts Western Desert that tested an aggregate 80 MMcf/d and 5,909 b/d. The Sultan 3X located on the Khalda Offset Concession test flowed 5,021 b/d and 11 MMcf/d from three commingled intervals in the Safa formation. The two other discoveries, the Adam 1X and the Maggie 1X, discovered new gas condensate fields on the Matruh development lease north of the Sultan discovery. Apache has a 100 percent contractor interest in both of the concessions. We anticipate completion of Sultan 3X as an oil well prior to the end of first quarter 2009, and completion of Adam 1X and Maggie 1X by year end 2009. Australia In Australia, we had two notable discoveries, the Halyard 1 and Brulimar 1 as well as continued appraisal success at Julimar and Bambra. We also progressed on several major long lead time development growth projects, including the Van Gogh and Pyrenees developments. In the Julimar Brunello area on Australias Northwest Shelf, we drilled three successful appraisal wells that will allow us to pursue a development strategy after completing our assessment of commercial options. Also, our subsidiaries made considerable progress in restoring operations at the Varanus Island gas processing and transportation hub, which sustained damage from a gas pipeline explosion in June 2008. Lastly, on January 6, 2009, we secured a 154 Bcf, seven year gas sales contract that enabled us to reinstate our Reindeer development program. These discoveries and developments are discussed in more detail below. Development and Appraisal Projects We have several large development projects underway in Australia. The Van Gogh and Pyrenees developments remain on schedule to deliver first production in 2009 and 2010, respectively, each with projected net rates of 20,000 b/d. Our Reindeer development program was reinstated following signing of a gas supply contract (discussed below) and is scheduled to deliver approximately 60 MMcf/d net to Apache in late 2011. Construction of pipeline and processing infrastructure is scheduled to commence in 2009. On January 6, 2009, the Company announced that it had signed a contract to supply natural gas from the Reindeer field to CITIC Pacifics Sino Iron project in Western Australia. The terms call for Apache and its joint venture partner to supply 154 billion cubic feet of gas over seven years beginning in the second half of 2011. Apache owns a 55 percent interest in the field. The gas will be supplied through a new 65 mile offshore pipeline and a new onshore sales gas processing facility at Devil Creek. Appraisal of the Julimar Brunello area on Australias Northwest Shelf progressed with three appraisal wells. In January 2008, we announced the Brulimar 1 discovery, which encountered 113 feet of net pay in the Upper Triassic Mungaroo sandstone. In April, we announced the Julimar Southeast 1 discovery, which logged 195 feet of net pay across five intervals of the Triassic Mungaroo sandstone. In May, we announced the Julimar Northwest 1 discovery, which logged 43 feet of net pay in the J 17 Triassic Mungaroo sandstone. We have now drilled seven discoveries in the complex. We plan to complete our appraisal program by mid 28 Table of Contents year and pursue a development strategy in the second half of 2009 after completing our assessment of commercial options. The Julimar development will not require funding until we determine which market is best suited for the asset. Apache is evaluating LNG options as well as domestic market options for Julimar gas. Apache owns a 65 percent interest in and operates the Julimar Brunello complex. Exploration Discoveries In April, we announced the Halyard 1 discovery on Australias WA 13 L block, which test flowed 68 MMcf/d. We are currently in the development design phase that includes consideration of a sub sea gathering line from Halyard to an existing pipeline at our East Spar field, 10 miles to the southeast, from which the gas can be transported to Varanus Island for processing. Using our existing infrastructure would accelerate development of the field and first sales. Apache obtained governmental approval for the Halyard Field development during the third quarter of 2008, and we are working toward first production in 2010. Apache has a 55 percent interest in and operates the block. We are currently evaluating the results of wells drilled in 2008 and seismic information to assess the future potential in the Gippsland basin. All six wells drilled in 2008 were either dry or non commercial. Varanus Island On June 3, 2008, subsidiaries of the Company reported a gas pipeline explosion at the Varanus Island gas processing and transportation hub offshore Western Australia, which shut in production at the John Brookes field and Harriet Joint Venture. When fully operational, the Islands operations process approximately 195 MMcf/d and 5,400 b/d, net to Apache subsidiaries. On August 5, 2008, partial production was reestablished from the John Brookes field, and by year end was at greater than 80 percent pre incident levels. The Harriet Joint Venture gas facilities are located adjacent to the pipeline explosion and required more significant repairs to restore operation. A portion of our gas production from the Harriet Joint Venture was restored in December 2008 and is projected to be fully restored in the first half of 2009. Harriet Joint Venture oil production is projected to be fully restored in the first quarter of 2009. The John Brookes field accounted for approximately 60 percent and 25 percent of the islands pre incident natural gas and oil production, respectively. Production from the Harriet Joint Venture accounted for the remaining 40 percent and 75 percent of the islands pre incident natural gas and oil production, respectively. Company subsidiaries operate the facilities and own a 68.5 percent interest in the Harriet Joint Venture and a 55 percent interest in the John Brookes field. Company subsidiaries maintain replacement cost insurance, subject to a deductible of approximately $7 million, with adequate limits to cover fully their share of the estimated cost of restoring the Varanus Island facilities. Canada During 2008, the Canadian region had an active development drilling program and commenced pursuit of an emerging shale gas play in northeast British Columbia. Notable activities during the year include: Exploration Projects During 2008, the Company completed a total of seven horizontal wells in the Ootla shale gas play, located in northeast British Columbia. December gross production averaged 2.5 MMcf/d. Current plans for the Ootla development in 2009 include drilling 31 gross horizontal wells and construction of compression and gathering infrastructure required to take the additional production to existing processing facilities. Based on information obtained from these wells, Apache expects to achieve significant improvements in both production rate and reserves per well. Apache has a 50 percent interest and operates approximately one half of its 400,000 gross acreage position in the play. 29 Table of Contents Development Projects Apache continues to target shallow gas, including coal bed methane (CBM), in areas such as Nevis, North Grant Lands and Provost. Intermediate depth drilling continued in the Kaybob, West 5 and South Grant Land areas of central and southern Alberta. North Sea Throughout 2008, the North Sea region invested in drilling and recompleting wells and facility enhancement programs. Key activities include: Development Projects During 2008, we completed 12 new development wells in the Forties field, which flowed at a combined rate of 18,900 b/d. Investments in facility upgrades and integrity related projects over the past five years have significantly reduced platform downtime. Coupled with production from new wells, these improved platform operating efficiencies enabled the regions fourth quarter 2008 production to reach an average 61,740 b/d. Annual production averaged 59,494 b/d, an 11 percent increase from 2007. Argentina During 2008, the Argentina region pursued active drilling and recompletion programs. In total, the region drilled 83 wells, 72 of which were productive. Significant activities include: Development Projects Apache drilled 30 new wells in the Neuqun basin, with a success rate of 100 percent, and continued to exploit two new plays with an aggressive drilling and recompletion campaign. Exploration Projects In 2008, Apache completed a nearly 2,500 square kilometer 3 D seismic mega shoot in Tierra del Fuego. Twenty nine wells were drilled in Tierra del Fuego, resulting in a number of new exploration discoveries and field extensions. Notable successes included the completion of the first phase appraisal campaign in the 2008 Seccin Baos block and the successful appraisal of La Sara Norte. We also made exploration discoveries at Las Flechas, Seccin Veintinueve, Camino Real and Perla. In the Cuyo basin, Apache was awarded the 4,710 square kilometer CCB 17 B block adjacent to and along a trend of existing producing fields, which increased our Argentine acreage portfolio by 34 percent. Chile During the third quarter of 2008, we commenced a seismic program on the two exploration blocks acquired in 2008. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues Crude Oil Natural Gas NGLs Total (In thousands) 2006 Revenues $ 4,911,861 $ 3,001,246 $ 161,146 $ 8,074,253 Volume increase (decrease) 616,179 404,311 16,214 1,036,704 Price increase (decrease) 827,725 34,111 21,680 883,516 Impact of hedges increase (decrease) (96,640 ) 64,149 (32,491 ) Increase (decrease) in 2007 $ 1,347,264 $ 502,571 $ 37,894 $ 1,887,729 2007 Revenues $ 6,259,125 $ 3,503,817 $ 199,040 $ 9,961,982 Contribution to total revenues 63 % 35 % 2 % 100 % Volume increase (decrease) 174,718 (426,055 ) (33,183 ) (284,520 ) Price increase (decrease) 2,174,202 894,818 40,025 3,109,045 Impact of hedges increase (decrease) (450,802 ) (7,866 ) (458,668 ) Increase (decrease) in 2008 $ 1,898,118 $ 460,897 $ 6,842 $ 2,365,857 2008 Revenues $ 8,157,243 $ 3,964,714 $ 205,882 $ 12,327,839 Contribution to total revenues 66 % 32 % 2 % 100 % Oil and Natural Gas Prices Crude Oil Prices A substantial portion of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Apaches oil realizations climbed precipitously in the first half of the year reaching a record $118.38 per barrel in June, before collapsing in the fourth quarter. Our realized oil price in December averaged nearly 70 percent lower than Junes peak, as demand for energy dropped following the onset of the global financial crisis. Apache manages a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices, primarily in North America, using financial instruments. In 2008, the 19 percent of our oil production that was subject to financial derivative hedges reduced revenues by $451 million, which comprised a $472 million loss in the first nine months and a $21 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2008. Refer to Note 3 Hedging and Derivative Instruments for the year end status of our derivatives. While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a worldwide market. With the exception of Argentina, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. In Argentina, we are currently selling our oil in the domestic market. The Argentine government previously imposed a sliding scale tax on oil exports, which effectively limits prices buyers are wiling to pay. Domestic oil prices are currently based on a $42 per barrel price, subject to quality adjustments, and producers realize a gradual increase or decrease as market prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra del Fuego, similar price formulas exist, but producers retain value added tax collected from buyers, effectively increasing price realizations by 21 percent. Natural Gas Prices Natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances stemming from local supply and demand conditions. The majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing local market prices. Apache uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, primarily in North America, including fixed price contracts and derivatives. In 2008, the 20 percent of our gas production that was subject to financial derivative hedges reduced revenues by $8 million, which comprised a $29 million loss for the first nine months and a gain of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Refer to Note 3 Hedging and Derivative Instruments for the year end status of our derivatives. Apache primarily sells natural gas into four markets: 1) North America, which has a common market and where most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. 31 Table of Contents 2) Egypt, where the majority of our gas is sold to Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMbtu. On up to 100 MMcf/d gross, there is no price cap for our gas under a legacy contract which expires in 2013. 3) Australia, which has a local market with mostly long term fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in Australias consumer price index. Subsequent to year end, however, Apache signed a contract on 85 bcf (net) that is indexed to oil prices following an initial period of fixed prices. 4) Argentina, where we receive low government regulated pricing on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category. During the year, we realized an average price of $.92 per Mcf on government regulated sales. The majority of the remaining volumes were sold at market driven prices, which exceeded $2.00 per Mcf at year end. Our average price for 2008 was $1.61 per Mcf.

NM Not Meaningful Year 2008 Compared to Year 2007 Crude Oil Revenues Apaches 2008 consolidated crude oil revenues increased $1.9 billion on a 28 percent increase in average realized price and a two percent increase in daily production. U.S. oil revenues were up $549 million, driven by a 26 percent increase in realized crude oil prices, more than offsetting one percent lower production. Prices in the U.S. averaged $83.70 per barrel in 2008, up 26 percent from 2007. Gulf Coast region oil was 2,700 b/d lower, reflecting the impact of hurricanes, which reduced the regions 2008 production by 6,941 b/d. Central region production was up five percent resulting primarily from production increases on the Permian basin properties acquired at the end of March 2007 and new drilling and recompletion activity in 2008. Egypts crude oil revenues increased $625 million on a 26 percent increase in realized price and a 10 percent increase in production. Price realizations averaged $91.37 per barrel, up from $72.51 per barrel in the prior year. Increases in oil production came from wells at El Diyur, Umbarka and East Bahariya, as well as higher cost recovery 33 Table of Contents volumes related to accelerated capital spending on the Salam gas plant expansion. These increases more than offset lower condensate volumes at Khalda because of scheduled Obayed and Salam plant shutdowns. North Sea oil revenues increased $697 million, a 50 percent increase over last year. Revenue gains were driven by a 35 percent increase in realized price and an 11 percent increase in production. Oil price realizations averaged $95.76, up $24.83 per barrel. Production was higher on a successful drilling and workover program and a reduction in platform downtime. Canadas oil revenues increased $120 million. Realized prices were up 37 percent and averaged $93.53 per barrel. Daily production declined nine percent on natural decline in various fields and divested properties, which more than offset drilling and recompletion activity. Argentinas crude oil revenues increased $33 million, with both production and realized prices up eight percent. Higher production was related to successful drilling, workover and recompletion activities, particularly in Tierra del Fuego. Realized prices increased on favorable quality adjustments received for oil which remains subject to price restrictions, as well as increased production from Tierra del Fuego, a tax favored area where producers retain the 21 percent value added tax collected from buyers. Australias 2008 oil revenues fell $124 million from 2007 on a 40 percent decline in production, which more than offset a 15 percent increase in realized prices. Nearly half of the production decline resulted from wells shut in following a pipeline explosion on June 3, 2008 at the Varanus Island gas processing and transportation hub. The remaining decrease is related to a natural decline. Partial production from our John Brookes field, and the associated condensate yields, was brought back on line in August, and by year end the field was at 80 percent pre incident levels. Harriet field oil production was mostly restored by year end and should be fully restored in early 2009. Condensate yields associated with Harriet gas production, which recommenced in December 2008, are expected to be fully restored in the first half of 2009 when repairs to the Harriet Joint Venture facility are completed. Natural Gas Revenues Apaches 2008 consolidated natural gas revenues increased $461 million, driven by a 25 percent increase in realized natural gas prices. Worldwide daily production was down 10 percent from 2007. U.S. natural gas revenues increased $227 million on higher prices as production declined 12 percent. Natural gas prices averaged $8.86, up $1.82 per Mcf. Central region gas production was up three percent on drilling and recompletion activities and incremental volumes from Permian basin properties acquired at the end of March 2007. Gulf Coast daily production was 21 percent lower on downtime, natural decline and a delay in Apaches drilling program related to the hurricanes. Canadas natural gas revenues rose $134 million on a 26 percent increase in realized natural gas prices. Gas price realizations climbed $1.64 to $7.94 per Mcf. Natural gas production decreased nine percent because of natural decline in various areas and property divestitures in early 2008. Egyptian gas revenues were up $103 million over 2007 on a 14 percent increase in price realizations and a 10 percent rise in production. Production rose on successful recompletions at our Matruh concession, new wells brought online at the Northeast Abu Gharadig concession and higher cost recovery volumes associated with an increase in capital spending related to the Salam gas plant expansion. Argentinas natural gas revenues increased $30 million on a 38 percent increase in realized price, offset by a three percent decline in daily production. Gas production was negatively impacted by gas re injections at Tierra del Fuego resulting from gas export and pipeline restrictions. Realized gas prices increased given the more favorable sales mix attained during the year. Relative to last year, we were able to deliver more volumes under higher priced industry contracts. We also benefited from a year over year increase in residential gas prices. Australias natural gas revenues fell $40 million on a 37 percent drop in production. Volumes were impacted by production shut in after an explosion on the pipeline that transports all of our gas production in Australia and resulting fire that damaged our processing facilities, as previously discussed. Following the incident, both the John Brookes and Harriet fields were shut in for approximately two months. John Brookes was the first field to come back online, with volumes partially restored in August and ramping up in subsequent months. Harriet production 34 Table of Contents came back online in December at reduced rates. At year end, John Brookes produced 80 percent of pre incident levels, while Harriet saw approximately one third of its pre incident volumes restored. Repairs are expected to be completed late in the first half of 2009. Year 2007 Compared to Year 2006 Crude Oil Revenues Apaches 2007 consolidated crude oil revenues totaled $6.3 billion, $1.3 billion above 2006, with nearly equal contributions from an 11 percent rise in production and a 15 percent increase in our realized oil price. On the whole, production increased an average 24,523 b/d, driven by the U.S. which was up 23,927 b/d. Crude oil price realizations averaged $68.84 per barrel for the year, $83.00 in the fourth quarter alone. U.S. oil revenues were up $879 million to $2.2 billion with $580 million, or two thirds of the increase, attributable to a 36 percent increase in production. A 23 percent increase in realized prices added the remaining $299 million. Gulf Coast production climbed 48 percent to 53,842 b/d, mainly on production restored from hurricane damaged properties, a full year of production from Gulf of Mexico properties acquired in June 2006 and successful drilling and recompletion activities. Central region production grew 21 percent to 36,917 b/d, with the addition of Permian basin properties acquired from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) in March 2007 and successful drilling and recompletion activities. In Egypt, crude oil revenues rose $294 million, to $1.6 billion, with increased production generating an additional $110 million of revenues. The balance of the increase in revenues, $184 million, came from a 14 percent increase in realized prices, which were up $8.91 to $72.51 per barrel. Daily production averaged 60,735 b/d, up seven percent. Production gains were associated with development drilling in the Khalda and Matruh concessions as well as the East Bahariya, Umbarka, El Diyur and North El Diyur concessions. Australias crude oil revenues of $401 million increased 35 percent, or $105 million. Production was 16 percent higher generating $55 million of the increase. Production growth resulted from an additional interest acquired in the Legendre field, completion of West Cycad wells and increased liquids from the Bambra, Wonnich Deep, Doric and Lee gas wells. Australias price realizations rose 17 percent to $79.79 per barrel, the highest in the Company, generating an additional $50 million of revenue. Argentinas oil revenues increased $85 million to $192 million, with over 90 percent of the increase associated with 67 percent higher production. The year 2007 benefited from a full year of production from acquisitions made in 2006, as well as successful drilling, workover and recompletion activity during the year. Higher volumes added $77 million to revenues, with price increases adding $8 million. Argentinas realized oil prices averaged $45.99 per barrel, up seven percent from the prior year. North Sea oil revenues increased $41 million to $1.4 billion. Oil prices averaged $70.93 per barrel, up 13 percent, adding $168 million in revenues. Production averaged 53,632 b/d, down eight percent, reducing revenues by $127 million. Production increases on three of our platforms were more than offset by declines from wells at the Alpha and Echo platforms while drilling operations were suspended for facility upgrades. Canadas oil revenues increased $15 million to $467 million, with a 14 percent price increase mostly offset by a nine percent decline in production. Prices averaged $68.29 per barrel, up from $59.90 in 2006. Production dropped in 2007 primarily because of natural decline resulting from a 38 percent reduction in exploration and development capital invested in Canada compared to 2006. China had no crude oil revenues in 2007 compared to $73 million in the prior year, a result of our August 2006 asset divestiture and exit from China. Natural Gas Revenues Apaches natural gas revenues increased 17 percent, or $503 million, to $3.5 billion. Higher production contributed $405 million of the additional revenues. Gas production averaged 1,796 MMcf/d, up 13 percent from 2006. Natural gas prices increased $.17 to an average $5.34 per Mcf, generating an additional $98 million in revenue. 35 Table of Contents U.S. natural gas revenues grew by $385 million to nearly $2 billion. U.S. production rose 15 percent, boosting revenues $264 million. Gulf Coast production increased 16 percent, boosted by final production restoration on hurricane damaged properties, a full year of production from Gulf of Mexico properties acquired in June 2006 and successful drilling and recompletion activities. Central region production climbed 14 percent on successful drilling and recompletion activities and the addition of Permian basin properties acquired in March 2007. Higher natural gas prices, which averaged $7.04 per Mcf compared to $6.54 in 2006, added $121 million to revenues. Gas revenues in Egypt were up $53 million, to $404 million, on an 11 percent increase in production and a four percent increase in price realizations. Production gains of 23 MMcf/d boosted the regions average output to 241 MMcf/d, generating an additional $39 million in revenues. Production gains resulted from higher throughput and less downtime at the Obaiyed plant compared to 2006 and new wells in the North East Abu Gharadig (NEAG) concession. Higher prices added another $14 million. Australias natural gas revenues increased $22 million to $134 million on higher price realizations and production gains. Price realizations improved 15 percent, adding $16 million to revenues. A five percent demand driven rise in production generated another $6 million of revenues. Argentinas natural gas revenues more than doubled to $86 million, bolstered by a full year of production from 2006 property acquisitions, successful drilling and recompletion activities and a 21 percent increase in price realizations. Production grew 89 MMcf/d, or 79 percent, generating $38 million of new revenues. The price gain added another $8 million. Canadas natural gas revenues decreased $6 million to $892 million on a four percent decline in production. Production, which averaged 388 MMcf/d, was impacted by natural decline, which more than offset increases from drilling and recompletion activities. Our exploration and development capital investment in Canada was 38 percent lower than 2006. Lower production reduced revenues by $37 million. Natural gas prices rose $.21, to $6.30 per Mcf, increasing revenues $31 million. Costs The table below compares our costs on an absolute dollar and boe basis. Our discussion may reference expenses either on a boe basis or on an absolute dollar basis, or both, depending on their relevance. Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) (Per boe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment Recurring $ 2,358 $ 2,208 $ 1,699 $ 12.06 $ 10.78 $ 9.29 Additional 5,334 27.27 Other assets 158 140 118 .81 .68 .64 Asset retirement obligation accretion 101 96 89 .52 .47 .48 Lease operating expenses 1,909 1,653 1,323 9.76 8.07 7.23 Gathering and transportation 157 137 120 .80 .67 .66 Taxes other than income 985 598 598 5.03 2.92 3.27 General and administrative expenses 289 275 211 1.48 1.34 1.16 Financing costs, net 166 220 142 .85 1.07 .78 Total $ 11,457 $ 5,327 $ 4,300 $ 58.58 $ 26.00 $ 23.51 36 Table of Contents Year 2008 Compared to Year 2007 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization The following table details the changes in recurring depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) of oil and gas properties between 2008 and 2007: Recurring DDA (In millions) 2007 $ 2,208 Volume change (127 ) Rate change 277 2008 $ 2,358 Recurring full cost depletion expense increased $150 million, $277 million on rate partially offset by $127 million on lower volumes. Our full cost depletion rate increased $1.28 to $12.06 per boe on drilling and finding costs that exceeded our historical cost basis. The higher industry wide costs, which also impact estimates of future development costs, have been driven by increased demand for drilling services, a consequence of higher oil and gas prices. In addition, we recorded a $5.3 billion ($3.6 billion net of tax) non cash write down of the carrying value of our December 31, 2008 proved property balances in the U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canada and Argentina proved oil and gas properties. Under the full cost method of accounting, the Company is required to review the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DDA and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted 10 percent, net of related tax effects. These rules generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the unescalated oil and gas prices and costs in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if the ceiling is exceeded, even if prices declined for only a short period of time. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities. If oil and gas prices deteriorate from the Companys year end levels, additional write downs may occur. Lease Operating Expenses Lease operating expenses (LOE) include several components: direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity price levels and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e. offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc). Rising commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Other items such as labor, boats, helicopters and materials and supplies are indirectly impacted as high prices increase industry activity and demand and thus, costs. Oil, which contributed nearly half of our production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote plants and facilities. All production in Australia and the North Sea and nearly 90 percent from the U.S. Gulf Coast region comes from offshore properties. Workovers accelerate production; hence, activity generally increases with higher commodity prices. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact the Companys LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding to per unit costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar lowering per unit costs in our international regions. LOE increased 15 percent on an absolute dollar basis. On a per unit basis LOE was up 21 percent, or $1.69 per boe. The following discussion focuses on per unit costs which we believe to be the most meaningful measure for analyzing LOE. Higher operating costs in all regions, including increased power costs in the U.S. and Egypt along with increased labor costs in the North Sea and Argentina, drove the rate up $.33. Increased workover activity, primarily in the U.S. and Egypt, resulted in an increase of $.29. 37 Table of Contents Hurricane repairs in the U.S. contributed $.07 to increased cost. Repairs related to the pipeline explosion at Varanus Island in Australia added $.03. Non recurring repairs and maintenance in Egypt, Australia, the North Sea and Argentina increased $.07. Overall production declines resulted in an increase of $.45, with the impact from a combined 12 percent production decline in the U.S., Canada and Australia partially offset by increased production in Egypt, the North Sea and Argentina. The main contributors were decreased production in Australia, $.30, and production shut in because of the hurricanes, $.29. Gathering and Transportation We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third party carrier and receive a price with no transportation deduction. In this case we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. In both the U.S. and Canada, we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay transportation to a third party carrier. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements. In Argentina, we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs we paid directly to third party carriers for each of the periods presented: For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 (In millions) U.S. $ 39 $ 38 Canada 64 54 North Sea 28 27 Egypt 21 15 Argentina 5 3 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 157 $ 137 Total Gathering and Transportation per boe $ .80 $ .67 These costs are primarily related to the portion of natural gas in our U.S. and Canadian operation sold under arrangements where we pay transportation directly to third parties North Sea crude oil sales and our Egyptian crude oil exports not sold under netback arrangements. The $20 million increase was driven primarily by higher transportation tariffs in Canada and an increase in Egyptian export volumes. Taxes other than Income Taxes other than income primarily comprises United Kingdom (U.K.) Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. and Canada. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties field in the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes including U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum Resources Rent tax and various Canadian taxes including: Freehold 38 Table of Contents Mineral tax, Saskatchewan Capital tax and Saskatchewan Resources Surtax. We also pay taxes on invoices and bank transactions in Argentina. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses: For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 (In millions) U.K. PRT $ 695 $ 346 Severance taxes 168 142 Ad valorem taxes 71 56 Other taxes 51 54 Total Taxes other than Income $ 985 $ 598 Total Taxes other than Income per boe $ 5.03 $ 2.92 U.K. PRT was $349 million more than 2007 on a 98 percent increase in net profits, driven by higher oil revenues. The increase in severance taxes resulted from higher taxable revenues in the U.S., consistent with the higher realized oil and natural gas prices in the first nine months of the year. The $15 million increase in ad valorem taxes resulted from higher taxable valuations associated with increases in oil and natural gas prices at the time the taxes were assessed and a full year of taxes on the Permian Basin properties acquired in the first quarter of 2007. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses (GA) were $14 million higher. On a boe basis, GA averaged $1.48, up $.14 per boe on a combination of increased costs and lower volumes, each of which added $.07 to the rate. The cost increase was driven by higher legal fees, especially in our international operations, increased incentive compensation expenses and miscellaneous higher costs in several departments, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expenses related to cash settled stock appreciation rights. Financing Costs, Net The major components of financing costs, net, include interest expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs for 2008 decreased $54 million or $.22 per boe, on lower average outstanding debt balances. Interest expense was down $28 million on lower average debt. Capitalized interest was up primarily because of higher expenditures associated with long term construction projects that are under development. Provision for Income Taxes There were no significant changes in statutory tax rates in the major jurisdictions in which the Company operates during 2008. In 2007 we saw a significant reduction to deferred income taxes resulting from Canadian tax rate reductions. The provision for income taxes decreased $1.6 billion from 2007 to $220 million, as income before taxes decreased 80 percent as a result of the $5.3 billion in additional DDA recorded in conjunction with the ceiling test write down. The effective income tax rate for the year was 23.6 percent compared to 39.8 percent in 2007. The 2008 effective rate was impacted by the magnitude of the taxes related to the write down, non cash benefits related to the effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our foreign deferred tax liabilities and other net tax settlements. Excluding these items, the 2008 effective rate would have been comparable to the 2007 effective rate. The 2007 effective rate was impacted by a non cash charge related to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign deferred tax liabilities. Partially offsetting this charge was an out of period benefit from Canadian federal tax rate reductions enacted in the second and fourth quarters of 2007. 39 Table of Contents Year 2007 Compared to Year 2006 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization The following table details the changes in depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) of oil and gas properties between 2007 and 2006: DDA (In millions) 2006 $ 1,699 Volume change 210 Rate change 299 2007 $ 2,208 Full cost DDA expense totaled $2.2 billion, $509 million more than 2006. Production growth drove $210 million of the increase; the remainder is a consequence of higher costs. DDA per boe averaged $10.78, $1.49 higher than 2006 as the costs to acquire, find and develop reserves continued to exceed our historical cost basis. Increasing costs also impact our estimates for future development of known reserves and estimates to abandon properties, both of which impact our full cost depletion rate. DDA on other assets increased $22 million to $140 million with facilities coming online, in Canada, Egypt and the U.S. A full year of DDA on assets acquired during 2006 in Argentina also contributed to the year over year increase. Lease Operating Expenses Lease operating expenses (LOE) increased 25 percent on an absolute dollar basis. On a per unit basis LOE was up 12 percent, or $.84 per boe. Almost two thirds of the increase was from additional workover activity ($.16), a weakening U.S. dollar ($.16), hurricane repair activity ($.15) and incentive based compensation ($.07). The remaining increase is the result of the inflationary impact of higher commodity prices on all other operating costs, as described above. The U.S. contributed $.47 to the $.84 per boe increase. Driving factors in the increase were additional hurricane repairs ($.15), more workover activity ($.13), acquired Permian basin oil properties which carry a higher rate than our historical average ($.05), incremental incentive based compensation with Apaches rising stock price ($.04) and the inflationary impact higher commodity prices have on operating costs ($.05). Over two thirds of the increase in workover activity occurred on properties acquired in March 2007 in the Permian basin of West Texas. Canada added $.30 per boe to the consolidated rate, $.09 of which was attributed to a decline in relative production. A weakening U.S. dollar negatively impacted the rate an additional $.09. The balance of the increase related to higher levels of workover activity ($.03), lease rentals ($.02), company labor ($.02) and generally higher costs. The North Sea increased the consolidated rate $.09 per boe: the net impact of a $.10 per boe increase on a decline in production volumes and a reduction of $.01 on lower costs. The benefit of decreases in diesel fuel consumption ($.08) and lower turnaround expenses more than offset increases from the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar ($.05), higher standby and supply boat costs ($.01) and higher contract labor ($.01). We are seeing the benefits of several years of facility upgrades to reduce the operating costs, including completion of our power generation ring. Australia increased the consolidated rate $.09 per boe over 2006. The increase was primarily a result of our acquisition of an additional interest in Legendre, an oil field which carries a higher cost per barrel than our existing blended Australian rate ($.06), and appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar ($.02). Two Argentine acquisitions, in April and September 2006, lowered the 2007 consolidated rate $.13 per boe. The LOE rate on these properties was lower than our existing consolidated rate. 40 Table of Contents Egypt had no impact on the consolidated rate. Our 2006 exit from China increased the 2007 consolidated rate $.04 per boe. Gathering and transportation Gathering and transportation costs totaled $137 million, up $17 million. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs paid by Apache to third party carriers for each of the periods presented. For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In millions) U.S. $ 38 $ 32 Canada 54 50 North Sea 27 26 Egypt 15 11 Argentina 3 1 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 137 $ 120 Total Gathering and Transportation per boe $ .67 $ .66 These costs are primarily related to the portion of natural gas in our U.S. and Canadian operation sold under arrangements where we pay transportation directly to third parties, and North Sea crude oil sales and our Egyptian crude oil exports not sold under netback arrangements. The $17 million increase was driven primarily by U.S. production growth, an increase in Egyptian crude exports not sold under netback arrangements and a full year of transportation costs paid to third parties in Argentina. Taxes other than Income Taxes other than income totaled $598 million for 2007 and 2006. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses: For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In millions) U.K. PRT $ 346 $ 394 Severance taxes 142 122 Ad Valorem taxes 56 44 Other taxes 54 38 Taxes other than Income $ 598 $ 598 Taxes other than Income per boe $ 2.92 $ 3.27 On a per unit basis taxes other than income decreased $.35, or 12 percent, reflecting the 12 percent increase in equivalent production. The increase in severance taxes was driven by higher production and prices on U.S. and Australian properties burdened by such taxes. U.K. PRT was 12 percent below 2006, largely driven by lower comparable revenues on less production and slightly higher deductible costs. Deductible costs include capital expenditures, LOE, general and administrative expenses (GA) and transportation tariffs. Ad valorem taxes increased $12 million. Oil and liquids were 47 percent of our production in both 2007 and 2006. A significant portion of our ad valorem taxes are reserve based and increase when prices rise. Other taxes increased with a full year of taxes on invoice and bank transactions in Argentina. 41 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses (GA) were $64 million, or $.18 per boe, higher than 2006. Incentive based compensation added $.12 per boe to the rate, a consequence of a strong stock price appreciation during the year, while insurance costs added $.11 per boe, a consequence of industry wide premium increases after the 2005 hurricanes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rate stemming from higher production. Financing Costs, Net The major components of financing costs, net, include interest expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs for 2007 increased $78 million or $.29 per boe, on higher average outstanding debt balances, which offset a slightly lower average interest rate. Provision for Income Taxes The 2007 provision for income taxes was $1.9 billion, $403 million above 2006 on both higher taxable income and a higher effective tax rate. Apaches 2007 effective tax rate was 39.8 percent compared to 36.3 percent in 2006. The 2007 effective rate was impacted by a non cash charge related to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign deferred tax liabilities. Partially offsetting this charge was an out of period benefit from Canadian federal tax rate reductions enacted in the second and fourth quarters of 2007. The 2006 effective tax rate was impacted by a charge related to retroactive application of a 10 percent increase in the oil and gas company supplemental tax enacted by the U.K., a benefit from a Canadian federal provincial tax rate reduction enacted in the second quarter of 2006 and a gain recognized on the sale of China. Foreign currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on the 2006 rate. Acquisitions and Divestitures 2008 Activity There was no major acquisition activity during 2008; however, the Company completed several divestiture transactions. On January 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359 on the outer continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to WT Offshore, Inc. for $116 million. On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas to Vanguard Permian, LLC for $78 million. On April 2, 2008, the Company completed the sale of non strategic Canadian properties to Central Global Resources for $112 million. These divestitures are subject to normal post closing adjustments. 2007 Activity U.S. Gulf Coast Farm in On September 6, 2007, Apache entered into an Exploration Agreement with various EnerVest Partnerships (EVP) for an initial term of four years whereby Apache committed to spend $30 million in qualified expenditures to explore, drill, produce and market hydrocarbons from specified undeveloped formations across 400,000 net acres in Central and East Texas. As of December 31, 2008, Apache has fulfilled the $30 million commitment. U.S. Permian Basin On March 29, 2007, the Company closed its acquisition of controlling interest in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian basin of West Texas from Anadarko for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these fields had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls) of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas as of year end 2006. The Company funded the acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko entered into a joint venture arrangement to effect the transaction. The Company entered into cash flow hedges for a portion of the crude oil and the natural gas production. 2006 Activity U.S. Permian Basin On January 5, 2007, the Company purchased Amerada Hesss interest in eight fields located in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from $404 million to $269 million because other interest owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase a number of the properties. The settlement price at closing of $239 million was adjusted for revenues and expenditures 42 Table of Contents occurring between the effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. The acquired fields had estimated proved reserves of 27 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 27 Bcf of natural gas as of year end 2005. Argentina On April 25, 2006, the Company acquired the operations of Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer) in Argentina for $675 million. The settlement price at closing, of $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and expenditures occurring between the effective date and closing date of the acquisition. The properties are located in the Neuqun, San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and had estimated net proved reserves of approximately 22 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of natural gas as of December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing plants (five operated and three non operated), 112 miles of operated pipelines in the Neuqun basin and 2,200 square miles of three dimensional (3 D) seismic data were also included in the transaction. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands): Proved property $ 501,938 Unproved property 189,500 Gas Plants 51,200 Working capital acquired, net 11,256 Asset retirement obligation (13,635 ) Deferred income tax liability (37,630 ) Cash consideration $ 702,629 On September 19, 2006, Apache acquired additional interests in (and now operates) seven concessions in the Tierra del Fuego Province from Pan American Fueguina S.R.L. (Pan American) for total consideration of $429 million. The settlement price at closing of $396 million was adjusted for normal closing items, including revenues and expenses between the effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. The total cash consideration allocated below includes working capital balances purchased, asset retirement obligations assumed and an obligation to deliver specific gas volumes in the future. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands): Proved property $ 289,916 Unproved property 132,000 Gas plants 12,722 Working capital acquired, net 8,929 Asset retirement obligation (1,511 ) Assumed obligation (46,000 ) Cash consideration $ 396,056 U.S. Gulf Coast In June 2006, the Company acquired the remaining producing properties of BP plc (BP) on the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from $1.3 billion for 18 producing fields to $845 million because other interest owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase five of the 18 fields. The purchase price consisted of $747 million of proved property, $42 million of unproved property and $56 million of facilities. The settlement price on the date of closing of $821 million was adjusted primarily for revenues and expenditures occurring between the April 1, 2006 effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. The acquired properties include 13 producing fields (nine of which are operated) with estimated proved reserves of 19.5 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 148 Bcf of natural gas. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper. 43 Table of Contents Divestitures On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 55 percent interest in the deepwater section of Egypts West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for $413 million. Apache did not have any proved reserves booked for these properties. On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block, offshore the Peoples Republic of China, to Australia based ROC Oil Company Limited for $260 million, marking Apaches exit from China. The effective date of the transaction was July 1, 2006. The Company recorded a gain of $174 million in the third quarter of 2006. Capital Resources and Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for each of the three years ended December 31. The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, elsewhere in this document, which include accruals. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,065 $ 5,677 $ 4,313 Sales of property and equipment 308 67 678 Net commercial paper and bank loan borrowings 1,630 Project financing draw downs 100 Fixed rate debt borrowings 796 2,002 Common stock issuances 36 44 39 Other 39 26 36 8,344 7,816 6,696 Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Capital expenditures 5,823 4,802 4,140 Purchase of short term investments 792 Acquisitions 150 1,005 2,164 Net commercial paper and bank loan repayments 200 1,425 Payments on debt 170 Repurchase of common stock 174 Dividends 239 205 154 Other 84 224 152 7,288 7,831 6,784 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,056 $ (15 ) $ (88 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) is our primary source of capital and liquidity. Factors affecting changes in operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non cash expenses such as DDA and deferred income tax expense. Factors affecting our operating cash flows are discussed in the Results of Operations section of this report. Operating cash flows in 2008 increased from 2007. Fixed Rate Debt Issuances On October 1, 2008, the Company issued $400 million principal amount, $398 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 6.0 percent notes maturing September 15, 2013, and $400 million principal amount, $398 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 6.9 percent notes maturing September 15, 2018. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apaches option, subject to a make whole premium. The 44 Table of Contents proceeds are presently invested in U.S. Treasury Bills and will be used for general corporate purposes or, possibly, future acquisitions. Project Financing Draw downs On December 5, 2008, one of the Companys Australian subsidiaries entered into a secured revolving syndicated credit facility for the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments. The facility provides for total commitments of $350 million with availability determined by a borrowing base formula. The borrowing base was set at $350 million and will be redetermined at completion and semi annually thereafter. The facility is secured by certain assets associated with the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments, including the shares of stock of the Companys subsidiary holding the assets. The Company has agreed to guarantee the credit facility until completion occurs pursuant to terms of the facility, which is expected in 2010. The commitments under the facility will be reduced by scheduled increments every six months beginning June 30, 2010, with final maturity on March 31, 2014. Interest is based on LIBOR, which may be subject to change under certain market disruption conditions, plus a margin of 1.00 percent pre completion and 1.75 percent post completion. The pre completion margin increases to 1.125 percent in the event the Companys ratings are downgraded to BBB+ or below by at least two major rating agencies. As of December 31, 2008 there was $100 million outstanding under the facility. Capital Expenditures We fund exploration and development activities primarily through net cash provided by operating activities and budget capital expenditures based on projected operating cash flows. Our operating cash flows, both in the short and long term, is impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, management primarily relies on annual operating cash flow forecasts. Annual operating cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to these adjusted operating cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs. Longer term operating cash flows and capital spending projections are rarely used by management to operate the business. Historically, we have used a combination of our operating cash flow, borrowings under the our lines of credit and commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund significant acquisitions. The following table details capital expenditures for each country in which we do business. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Exploration and Development: United States $ 2,183,473 $ 1,630,776 $ 1,532,959 Canada 705,066 650,676 1,056,614 Egypt 852,802 605,115 454,892 Australia 879,680 516,054 179,892 North Sea 459,239 537,868 329,498 Argentina 317,490 287,047 115,570 Chile 27,457 China 12,288 5,425,207 4,227,536 3,681,713 Acquisitions Oil and gas properties 149,838 1,024,956 2,428,432 Asset Retirement Costs 513,891 439,368 390,612 Capitalized Interest 94,164 75,748 61,301 Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities 659,248 473,481 248,589 Total capital expenditures $ 6,842,348 $ 6,241,089 $ 6,810,647 Exploration and Development (ED) Increases in our 2008 operating cash flows, year over year, enabled us to invest larger amounts on ED capital projects. We invested $5.4 billion on drilling, recompletions and 45 Table of Contents platform and production support facilities in 2008, up 28 percent from 2007. Our 2007 ED capital expenditures were $546 million above 2006. Acquisitions We completed $150 million of acquisitions in 2008 compared to $1 billion in 2007. Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive opportunities arise and, therefore, vary from year to year. Asset Retirement Costs In 2008, we recorded $514 million of additional asset retirement costs. The increase is primarily related to revisions of our cost estimates. Rising estimates for service costs and the high level of abandonment activities in the Gulf Coast region have accelerated some obligations. Continued worldwide drilling programs, acquisition activity and damage from Hurricane Ike also contributed to the increased abandonment costs. Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities (GTP) We invested $659 million in GTP facilities in 2008 compared to $473 million in 2007. In Egypt, we invested $571 million in gas processing facilities to alleviate capacity constraints, which are restricting production. We also invested $55 million in Australia on GTP projects currently in process. In Canada, we invested $29 million in processing plants. 2009 Outlook In light of a collapse in commodity prices and uncertainties surrounding the worldwide financial crisis, we seek to keep capital spending in line with 2009 operating cash flows in order to preserve our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. We will closely monitor commodity prices, service cost levels and predicted operating cash and will adjust our exploration and development budgets accordingly. While certain long lead development projects are committed in 2009, the majority of our drilling and development projects are discretionary and subject to deferral or cancellation as conditions warrant. Because we revise our exploration and development capital budgets frequently throughout the year, projecting future expenditures is difficult at best. Our 2009 preliminary plan includes exploration and development capital of approximately $3.5 to $4.0 billion, including GTP. We generally do not project estimates for acquisitions because their occurrence and timing is unpredictable. Any acquisitions would be funded from operating cash flow, credit facilities, issuing new equity, or a combination thereof. Repurchases of Common Stock On April 19, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 million shares of the Companys common stock, representing a market value of approximately $1 billion on the date of announcement. The Company may buy shares from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or a combination of both. The timing and amounts of any purchases will be at the discretion of Apaches management. The Company initiated the purchase program on May 1, 2006, after the Companys first quarter 2006 earnings information was disseminated in the market. During 2006, the Company purchased 2,500,000 shares at an average price of $69.74 per share. No stock purchases were made in 2007 or 2008, and we currently have no plans to purchase any shares in 2009. Dividends The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 44 consecutive years through 2008. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. Common dividends paid during 2008 rose 17 percent to $234 million, reflecting the special cash dividend of 10 cents per common share paid on March 18, 2008 and an increase in common shares outstanding. Common dividends paid during 2007 rose 34 percent to $199 million, reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and an increase in the common stock dividend rate. The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend 50 percent, to 15 cents per share from 10 cents per share, effective with the November 2006 dividend payment. During 2008 and 2007, Apache paid a total of $6 million in dividends each year on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. See Note 7 Capital Stock of Item 15 in this Form 10 K. 46 Table of Contents Liquidity At December 31, Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2008 2007 2006 Cash $ 1,181 $ 126 $ 141 Short term investments 792 Restricted cash 14 Total debt 4,922 4,227 3,822 Shareholders equity 16,509 15,378 13,192 Available committed borrowing capacity 2,550 2,115 690 Floating rate debt/total debt 2 % 5 % 43 % Percent of total debt to capitalization 23 % 22 % 22 % Thus far, our liquidity and financial position have not been affected by recent events in the credit markets. We believe that losses from non performance are unlikely to occur; however, we are not able to predict sudden changes in the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. The banks with lending commitments to the Company have credit ratings of at least single A (or equivalent) which in some cases is based on government support. There is no assurance that the financial condition of these banks will not deteriorate or that the government guarantee will be maintained. We closely monitor the ratings of the 27 banks in our bank group. Having a large bank group allows the Company to mitigate the impact of any banks failure to honor its lending commitment. Cash and Cash Equivalents We had $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008, compared with $126 million at December 31, 2007. The majority of this cash is in our foreign subsidiaries ($146 million was in U.S.) and is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. Almost all of the cash is denominated in U.S. dollars and, at times, is invested in highly liquid, investment grade securities, with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We intend to use cash from our international subsidiaries to fund international projects. Short term Investments The Company occasionally invests in highly liquid, short term investments in order to maximize our income on available cash balances. As needed, we may reduce such short term investment balances to further supplement our operating cash flows. At December 31, 2008, we had $792 million invested in obligations of the U.S. Government with original maturities greater than three months but less than a year. Restricted Cash The Company classifies cash balances as restricted cash when it is restricted as to withdrawal or usage. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $14 million of property divestiture proceeds classified as restricted cash and held in escrow available for use in a like kind exchange under Section 1031 of the U.S. federal income tax code. The Company expected to use these funds to purchase noncurrent assets. Accordingly, the restricted cash was classified as long term at year end. Subsequent to year end, the time limits pursuant to Section 1031 expired and the funds were transferred to cash. Debt At year end 2008, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes, debentures and uncommitted bank lines, totaled $4.9 billion. Current debt includes $100 million of Apache Finance Pty Limited 7.0 percent notes due March 2009 and $13 million borrowed under uncommitted overdraft lines in Argentina. We have no debt maturing in 2010 or 2011, $439 million maturing in 2012, $942 million maturing in 2013 and the remaining $3.4 billion maturing intermittently in years 2014 through 2096. Debt to Capitalization Ratio The Companys debt to capitalization ratio as of December 31, 2008 was 23 percent. Available Credit Facilities The Company had available borrowing capacity under our total credit facilities of approximately $2.6 billion at December 31, 2008; $2.3 billion of unsecured revolving syndicated bank credit facilities and $250 million under one of the Companys Australian subsidiaries secured revolving syndicated credit facility for the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments, entered into in December 2008. The Company was in compliance with the terms of all credit facilities as of December 31, 2008. 47 Table of Contents The $2.3 billion of unsecured revolving syndicated bank credit facilities mature in May 2013. Since there were no outstanding borrowings or commercial paper at year end, the full $2.3 billion of unsecured credit facilities were available to the Company. These facilities consist of a $1.5 billion facility and a $450 million facility in the U.S., a $200 million facility in Australia and a $150 million facility in Canada. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S. and Canada of up to five percent of the Companys consolidated assets, which approximated $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2008. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group. Furthermore, our non cash write down of oil and gas properties in 2008 does not impact the availability of credit lines or result in non compliance with any covenants. There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2008. At the Companys option, the interest rate for the facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent or (ii) the London Inter bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the Companys senior long term debt rating. The $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities (U.S. credit facilities) also allow the company to borrow under competitive auctions. At December 31, 2008, the margin over LIBOR for committed loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and .23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the Companys senior long term debt rating. The U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apaches commercial paper program. On December 5, 2008, one of the Companys Australian subsidiaries entered into a secured revolving syndicated credit facility for the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments. The facility provides for total commitments of $350 million with availability determined by a borrowing base formula. The borrowing base was set at $350 million and will be redetermined at project completion and semi annually thereafter. The facility is secured by certain assets associated with the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments, including the shares of stock of the Companys subsidiary holding the assets. The Company has agreed to guarantee the credit facility until completion occurs pursuant to terms of the facility, which is expected in 2010. The commitments under the facility will be reduced by scheduled increments every six months beginning June 30, 2010, with final maturity on March 31, 2014. Interest is based on LIBOR, which may be subject to change under certain market disruption conditions, plus a margin of 1.00 percent pre completion and 1.75 percent post completion. The pre completion margin increases to 1.125 percent in the event the Companys ratings are downgraded to BBB+ or below by at least two major rating agencies. As of December 31, 2008, there is $100 million outstanding under the facility. Commercial Paper Program The Company has available a $1.95 billion commercial paper program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, Apache had no commercial paper outstanding. Our weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was 5.65 percent and 3.85 percent for 2008 and 2007, respectively. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper 48 Table of Contents following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. credit facilities are available as a 100 percent backstop. Credit Ratings We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near term and long term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. Apaches senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated A3 by Moodys, A by Standard Poors and A by Fitch. Apaches short term debt rating for its commercial paper program is currently P 2 by Moodys, A 2 by Standard Poors and F1 by Fitch. The outlook is stable from Moodys and Standard Poors and negative from Fitch. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt and potentially require the Company to post letters of credit in certain circumstances. We cannot predict, nor can we assure, that we will not receive a ratings downgrade in the future. Pricing Trends. For 2008, the Companys average realized prices were substantially higher than the previous years prices. In fact, prices continued a general upward trend until July of this year, at which time prices began to decline significantly. Crude oil trades in global market; consequently, prices for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. Natural gas has a limited global transportation system and, therefore, is subject to local supply and demand conditions. Approximately two thirds of our natural gas is sold in the North American market, which tracks New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices, while the remaining is sold under fixed price contracts in regulated markets. Following is a table of the published monthly average NYMEX prices in 2008: December November October September August July Crude Oil $ 42.04 $ 57.44 $ 76.77 $ 104.41 $ 116.73 $ 134.42 Natural Gas $ 5.79 $ 6.70 $ 6.73 $ 7.50 $ 8.30 $ 11.20 While we are presently in a strong financial position, continued lower prices would negatively impact our future oil and gas production revenues, earnings and liquidity. Commodity prices are volatile and future prices cannot be accurately predicted. Apaches investment decisions are based on longer term commodity prices. For these reasons, we have historically based our capital expenditure budget on projected cash flows, modifying initial budgets in the event of significant changes in commodity prices. Given the recent commodity price levels, our initial 2009 budgeted expenditures is substantially less than projected 2008 levels. We also believe that certain service costs will be reduced, but historically there has been a lag between a precipitous drop in commodity prices and the underlying service costs necessary to find, develop and produce oil and natural gas. Contractual Obligations We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. 49 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008.

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $27 million for environmental remediation and approximately $25 million for various legal liabilities. See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies. The Company also accrued approximately $74 million as of December 31, 2008, for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a member of this insurance pool, which insures specific property, pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential termination fee is calculated annually based on past losses, and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required. Subsequent Event On February 10, 2009, Apaches wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Canada Ltd. entered into an agreement with TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TCPL) pursuant to which TCPL will construct and install a gas pipeline from northeastern British Columbia to the existing NOVA pipeline system located in the Ekwan area of Alberta. Apache Canada intends to ship gas produced from the Ootla basin on the new pipeline. The construction, operation and transportation rates of the new pipeline are subject to regulatory approval. Authority to construct the pipeline is expected, and construction is anticipated to be complete on or before April 1, 2011. Upon completion of the pipeline, Apache Canada will have a ship or pay commitment of 100 MMBtu of gas 50 Table of Contents for either a four year period or a ten year period depending on the rate structure determined and approved by the regulatory agency. Apache Canada has the right to terminate the agreement before October 1, 2009. If Apache Canada elects to terminate the agreement or TCPL terminates for reasons set forth in the agreement, Apache Canada must reimburse TCPL for certain costs and expenses up to approximately CDN $90 million plus certain taxes. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apaches financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of Apaches most critical accounting policies: Reserve Estimates Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production sharing arrangements utilizing the economic interest method, which excludes the host countrys share of reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. As such, our reserve engineers review and revise the Companys reserve estimates at least annually. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DDA expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future, and contracts and regulation often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. ARO associated with retiring tangible long lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, 51 Table of Contents regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Income Taxes Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in six countries. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the Companys tax returns. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates, foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Commodity Risk The Companys revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile due to unpredictable events such as economical growth or retraction, weather and climate. Crude oil prices in 2008 began the year strong and increased rapidly to unprecedented levels in the summer, before decreasing to below first quarter 2008 prices by the end of the year. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), an industry benchmark crude oil, peaked above $147 per barrel in July before falling to nearly $40 at year end as a result of decreased demand for energy as world economies slowed. Natural gas prices, especially in the U.S. where we have fewer long term supply contracts, followed a similar path. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Apache historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions; however, in 2007 and 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized management to hedge a portion of production generated from the Companys drilling program. Approximately 20 percent of our 2008 natural gas production and 19 percent of our crude oil production were subjected to financial derivative hedges. 52 Table of Contents On December 31, 2008, the Company had open natural gas derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of $47 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately $15 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately $18 million. The Company also had open oil derivatives in an asset position with a fair value of $165 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would decrease the asset by approximately $117 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the asset by approximately $118 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2008. See Note 3 Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this Form 10 K for notional volumes and terms associated with the Companys derivative contracts. Apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the President (principal financial officer), General Counsel, Treasurer and other key members of Apaches management, approve and oversee these controls, which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit, limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Interest Rate Risk On December 31, 2008, the Companys debt with fixed interest rates represented approximately 98 percent of total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately two percent of Apaches debt will fluctuate based on short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating interest rates on year end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately $707,000. Foreign Currency Risk The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts. Approximately half the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in U.S. dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars but converted into Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds and Argentine pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of Other under Revenues and Other or, as is the case when we re measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Companys provision for income tax expense on the Statement of Consolidated Operations.
