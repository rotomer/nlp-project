ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company engaged in worldwide crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production. In North America, our exploration and production operations are focused in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the Permian Basin, the Anadarko Basin and the Western Sedimentary Basin of Canada. Outside of North America, we have exploration and production operations onshore Egypt, offshore Western Australia, offshore the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the North Sea (North Sea), and onshore Argentina. We also have exploration interests on the Chilean side of the island of Tierra del Fuego. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K, and the Risk Factors information set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Executive Overview Strategy Apaches mission is to grow a profitable upstream oil and gas company for the long term benefit of our shareholders. Apaches long term perspective has many dimensions, with the following core principles: Own a balanced portfolio of core assets; Maintain financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet; and Optimize rates of return, earnings and cash flow. Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have underpinned our ability to deliver production and reserve growth and achieve competitive investment rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders. We have increased reserves 22 out of the last 24 years and production 29 out of the past 31 years, a testament to our consistency over the long term. These strategies have served us well in the past and should continue to serve us well going forward. However, we also believe several long term trends across the globe will have a tremendous impact on supply and demand for fuel and on Apaches business model in the years ahead. Demand for fuel continues to grow in many parts of the developing world, where billions of people are seeking to move up the economic ladder. A new psychology of scarcity is driving competition for resources around the world and testing many long held assumptions and relationships. The world will need all sources of energy including wind, solar and other alternatives to keep up with long term demand growth. In North America, recent improvements in horizontal drilling and completion technology have transformed the natural gas market, opening up a 100 year resource with the potential to improve U.S. energy security, create jobs and help achieve environmental and climate change goals. We believe Apaches evolution from a domestic driller and producer to an independent global exploration and production company, coupled with our sense of urgency, discipline, innovation and spirit, positions us well to take advantage of these impending trends. Our current production base provides the cash flow required for us to seek out larger exploration targets while developing our discoveries, including Qasr in Egypt, Julimar in Australia and the Horn River Basin of British Columbia. As we head into 2010, we anticipate that higher production will generate adequate cash flow to support a higher activity level compared to 2009. Two oil developments in Australia Van Gogh and Pyrenees will contribute significant volumes in 2010. Also, gas production in the Horn River Basin shale play will begin ramping up in 2010 as Apaches teams apply technological innovations to complete wells more quickly and at lower cost. 33 Table of Contents However, while we are comfortable that our $2 billion of cash on hand at year end and the additional liquidity available from our credit facilities will provide ample flexibility to pursue additional exploration activity or opportunistic, value adding acquisitions, lingering issues in the credit markets clearly demonstrate that any detectable economic recovery is fragile at best. Therefore, we will continue to manage drilling and development capital spending in line with available cash flow. Financial and Operating Results The dramatic decline in oil and gas prices and global financial crisis that began in 2008 provided the backdrop for our primary objective in 2009: living within our cash flow to preserve financial flexibility. Although we curtailed activity to achieve this objective, Apache delivered record annual average daily production up nine percent from 2008 and added slightly more reserves, excluding revisions, than we produced. The decline in oil and gas prices impacted Apaches 2009 financial results, requiring us to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties and resulting in a $1.98 billion non cash charge to earnings during the first quarter. However, with rebounding oil prices and higher production, earnings strengthened throughout the remainder of the year. To ensure we lived within cash flow, we reduced 2009 activity and investments to $4.1 billion, 39 percent below 2008 levels. Despite curtailed capital spending, we moved forward on several large development projects, pursued exploration opportunities resulting in several important new discoveries, increased production nine percent to a record 583,328 boe/d and generated $4.2 billion in net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, we maintained our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity levels, exiting 2009 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 24 percent, just over $2 billion of cash and $2.3 billion in available committed borrowing capacity. We also believe our single A debt ratings provide a competitive advantage in accessing capital. For the year, Apache recorded a net loss of $292 million, or $.87 per common diluted share, compared to 2008 net income of $706 million, or $2.09 per common diluted share. Apaches 2009 reported adjusted earnings (1) , which exclude certain items impacting the comparability of results, were $1.98 billion or $5.59 per common diluted share, down from $3.8 billion or $11.22 per common diluted share in the prior year. We generated net cash provided by operating activities totaling $4.2 billion, down from $7.1 billion in 2008. The following items impacted our 2009 earnings and cash flow as compared to 2008: Record production of 583,328 boe/d, up nine percent from 2008; Average realized oil prices decreased 32 percent to $59.85 per bbl; Average realized gas prices decreased 45 percent to $3.69 per Mcf; A non cash after tax write down of the carrying value of proved property of $1.98 billion in 2009 versus $3.6 billion in 2008 affected earnings; and Total operating expenses decreased $3.2 billion, or 28 percent, from 2008. (1) See Results of Operations Non GAAP Measures Adjusted Earnings for a description of Adjusted Earnings, which is not a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure, and a reconciliation to this measure from Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stock, which is presented in accordance with GAAP. Proposed Climate Change Legislation Management believes that climate change legislation globally is undergoing a phase of significant evolution, and as a consequence, the Company perceives an unusual lack of clarity surrounding this issue. Furthermore, in the United States, the Company is concerned that legislation will distort markets and protect other energy sectors. The Company believes that natural gas offers the most cost effective means to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rapidly and the Company is well positioned to contribute to an overall increase of natural gas supply. 34 Table of Contents Apache Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Total gross GHG emissions from Apache operated properties world wide are calculated and reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) on a country by country basis using recognized international protocols. Currently the CDP maintains a public access website with Apache information for calendar year 2008. Emissions for calendar year 2009 are due to be reported to CDP by May for posting later in 2010. Readers are advised that Apache GHG emissions values are not subject to the same rigorous controls for accuracy and reliability as financial data found in this filing, and that there are inherent limitations for directly measuring GHG emissions from oil and gas production facilities in general. In addition, for required facilities, Apache GHG emissions are reported to local and national authorities in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom following reporting standards specific to each jurisdiction, and verified according to regulatory requirements. For 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency will require emissions reports covering some of our largest fixed combustion facilities. Operating Highlights Operational highlights for the year and growth drivers for 2010 and beyond are as follows: Australia During 2009 the Australia region restored operations and increased capacity at the Varanus Island gas processing facility, and it continued to lay the foundation for future growth by developing previously discovered fields that will come on line over the short, intermediate and long terms. Our Van Gogh and Pyrenees discoveries (oil fields) commenced production in the first quarter of 2010. In the intermediate term, our Halyard and Reindeer discoveries (gas fields) are scheduled to begin producing in 2011. In the longer term, we will see additional production from our Julimar, Macedon and Coniston field discoveries, as discussed below. Discoveries expected to begin producing in 2010 Van Gogh Discovery Development Drilling and installation of subsea production equipment were completed in 2009 at the Apache operated Van Gogh field discovery. Limited production began in February 2010, with routine commissioning activities still being performed on the floating, production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) servicing the field. Pyrenees Discovery Development Installation of subsea facilities at our Pyrenees field was completed in 2009. First oil production commenced ahead of schedule, on February 24, 2010. As planned, the wells will be drilled and brought on in phases, with half of the expected production volume ramping up over the next six months. Peak production from the Van Gogh and Pyrenees discoveries is projected to reach a combined 40,000 b/d net to Apache. Discoveries expected to begin producing in 2011 Halyard Discovery Development In April 2008 we drilled the Halyard 1 discovery well, which tested 68 MMcf/d. We currently plan to tie the field into the existing nearby East Spar gas facilities. First production is anticipated in 2011. Reindeer Discovery Development Our Reindeer field discovery will be produced through an onshore gas plant currently under construction, the Devil Creek gas plant. In 2009, we entered into a gas sales contract covering a portion of the fields future production. Under the contract, Apache and our joint venture partner agreed to supply 154 Bcf of gas over seven years (approximately 60 MMcf/d) beginning in the second half of 2011 at prices higher than we have historically received in Western Australia. Apache owns a 55 percent interest in the field. The company is continuing to market its remaining net share in the Reindeer field. 35 Table of Contents Discoveries expected to begin producing after 2011 Julimar and Brunello Natural Gas Discoveries Our Julimar and Brunello natural gas discoveries will be produced through liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities (discussed below). The LNG project, which is currently in front end engineering and design (FEED), will convert the gas into LNG for sale on the world market. World LNG prices are typically tied to oil prices, and are currently higher than gas prices we have historically received in Western Australia. Our projected net sales would approximate 190 MMcf/d and 5,100 b/d with a projected 15 year production plateau when the multi year project is complete and all the wells are producing. Wheatstone LNG Project In October 2009, Apache announced an agreement to become a foundation equity partner in Chevrons Wheatstone LNG hub in Western Australia. Chevron, which has a 100 percent interest in the Wheatstone field, will operate the LNG facilities with a 75 percent interest. Apache will own 16.25 percent interest in the project and our partner in the Julimar and Brunello fields will own the remaining project interest. The Wheatstone project is targeting a final investment decision (FID) in 2011 and first sales from the facility are projected for 2015. Our net capital for the project is currently estimated to be $1.2 billion for upstream development of the Julimar and Brunello fields and $3.0 billion in the Wheatstone facilities. The investment will be funded as the multi year project is developed. Macedon and Coniston Discoveries We have two contingent development opportunities that will be evaluated during 2010. The Macedon field is a gas discovery near our Pyrenees field which is currently being reviewed by the operator, BHP Billiton, for commercial development. Gas produced from Pyrenees will be reinjected into the Macedon field to reduce flaring and conserve those volumes for future production. The Coniston field is an oil accumulation near our Van Gogh field. Apache drilled 10 appraisal wells during the year and is evaluating a development plan to tie back the field to the FPSO currently serving the Van Gogh field. Egypt Notable successes during the year include: 2X Project In June 2005, Apache and the Egyptian government set a goal to double gross equivalent production from Apache operated concessions by the end of 2010 (2X Project). At the time of the proposal, Apaches gross operated equivalent production was approximately 163 Mboe/d. As we exited 2009, Egypt was over 90 percent of the way to reaching that goal. Double digit Growth in both oil and gas production Egypts gross gas production increased 26 percent, driven by exploration successes at our Khalda and Matruh concessions and from additional plant and pipeline capacity. Additional capacity provided by the combination of two new processing trains at the Salam Gas Plant and completion of a project to increase compression on the Northern pipeline allowed previously discovered wells in the Khalda Concession Qasr field to come online. The increased compression in the Northern Gas Pipeline also allowed increased throughput at the nearby Tarek plant and enabled us to begin producing previous discoveries at the Jade and Falcon fields in our Matruh concession. Egypts gross oil production increased 25 percent on exploration successes in numerous concessions, most notably East Bahariya Extension, South Umbarka, Matruh, NEAG Extension and Khalda. Waterflood projects and increased condensate from additional Qasr gas flowing through the new processing trains at Salam Gas Plant also contributed. Additional plant and pipeline capacity expansion will be required in the coming years to keep pace with the internally generated discoveries described below. 36 Table of Contents Development, Exploration and Appraisal Activity Phiops Field Discovery Kalabsha Concession Current production from the Phiops field, initially discovered in late 2008, is approximately 8,100 b/d gross, with two of four completed wells shut in due to facility constraints. The Phiops field is the largest of five fields discovered in the Faghur Basin of the Western Desert since 2006 by Apache through its joint venture partner, Khalda Petroleum Company. We expect to increase production to 20,000 gross barrels per day when additional infrastructure is completed by mid 2010. To allow for future production growth, a second phase of infrastructure expansion to 40,000 b/d, is targeted for completion by the end of the third quarter of 2010. In addition, gas capacity of 38 MMcf/d is slated for mid 2011. Further exploration, appraisal and development activity in the concession is planned for 2010. Concession Extensions Amendments to extend our Siwa, Sallum, and West Ghazalat exploration concessions for an additional three years (to July 27, 2013) were approved by the Egyptian Parliament in June 2009. These concessions encompass 3.8 million gross acres, which Apache operates with a 50 percent contractor interest. Seismic acquisition and early exploration drilling is planned for 2010. Additionally, we finalized extension of the Khalda Offset and East Bahariya concessions in the Western Desert. At Khalda Offset, the exploration phase is extended until July 2016. Apache has a 100 percent contractor interest in this concession, which covers 909,000 acres. The East Bahariya concession exploration phase was extended through July 2012. Apache has a 100 percent contractor interest in this concession, which encompasses 674,000 acres. North Tarek Concession On April 30, 2009, we announced the NTRK C 1X well, our first discovery in this concession along the Mediterranean coast, tested at a rate of 3,489 b/d and 5 MMcf/d. Additional drilling is planned for 2010. Shushan C Concession Hydra Field Apache has had numerous exploration successes on this concession and is in the process of negotiating a Gas Sales Agreement with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). When the agreement is completed, we will file to establish a development lease. The most recent discovery, the Hydra 5X appraisal well, tested 21 MMcf/d and 3,744 b/d. This well follows Apaches Hydra 1X discovery drilled in 2008 which test flowed 76.6 MMcf/d and 2,813 b/d. Other Discoveries During 2009 we had three additional discoveries in Egypts Western Desert that tested an aggregate 80 MMcf/d and 5,909 b/d. The Sultan 3X located on the Khalda Offset Concession test flowed 5,021 b/d and 11 MMcf/d. The two other discoveries, the Adam 1X and the Maggie 1X, discovered new gas condensate fields on the Matruh development lease north of the Sultan discovery. Apache has a 100 percent contractor interest in both concessions. Oil production from Sultan 3X began in the first quarter of 2009. North America Apaches North American asset base, comprised of the U.S. Central and Gulf Coast Regions along with Canada, reflects the balanced portfolio approach that has long been one of the Companys greatest strengths. The Central Region provided steady, predictable results with its high quality assets and large acreage base. The Gulf Coast Region delivered solid production despite curtailment of capital spending. Also, the region restored virtually all production shut in by hurricanes. Canada laid the foundation for future growth through its shale gas plays and Kitimat LNG acquisition. Operating highlights for 2009 and future growth drivers for our North American operations include the following: U.S. Central Region During the second quarter of 2009 we announced the acquisition of nine Permian Basin oil and gas fields with current net production of 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Marathon Oil Corporation for $187.4 million, subject to normal post closing adjustments. These long lived oil fields fit well with Apaches existing properties in the Permian Basin, particularly in Lea County, N.M., and will provide us drilling opportunities for many years. The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2009. 37 Table of Contents In 2009 we drilled our first operated horizontal well in the Granite Wash play in Washita County, Oklahoma. The Hostetter #1 23H commenced production in September 2009 at 17 MMcf/d and 800 b/d and is currently producing 9.5 MMcf/d and 600 b/d. Apache owns a 72 percent working interest in the well. We have drilled extensively over the past decade in the Granite Wash, and as a result, we control approximately 200,000 gross acres in the play, mostly held by production. Hundreds of additional horizontal well locations have been identified across our acreage, extending opportunities for many years. In early 2010 we had three rigs in operation with plans to increase to at least five as we target drilling a minimum of 29 horizontal wells in the play during the year. U.S. Gulf Coast Region In April 2009 we announced a key deepwater discovery at Ewing Banks Block 998 that test flowed 4,254 b/d and 5.4 MMcf/d. The well will be connected to existing facilities, with first production projected for mid year 2010. Apache owns a 50 percent interest in the property. In May 2009 production commenced from two deepwater discoveries in the Geauxpher field, located on Garden Banks Block 462. During the second half of 2009, the field produced an average of 91 MMcf/d gross. Apache generated the prospect and has a 40 percent working interest. At South Timbalier 287 (drilled from Apaches South Timbalier 308 platform), the #A 8 well came online flowing 1,800 b/d. Apache has a 100 percent working interest in this well. At Ewing Banks 826, four successful wells were drilled as part of our redevelopment program. Initial production rates ranged from 500 b/d to 1,000 b/d per well. Apache has a 100 percent working interest in these wells. A relatively quiet hurricane season allowed the region to continue restoration of shut in production in the Gulf of Mexico. We made considerable progress, and virtually all production shut in by hurricanes has been restored. Canada Unconventional gas opportunities in Canada are anticipated to drive future growth of Apaches Canadian region, moving beyond conventional plays in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan that have been the foundation of the regions activities for 15 years. Horn River Basin Shale Gas Play Apache continued development activity on its Horn River Basin shale gas play in northeast British Columbia, where we have over 220,000 highly prospective net acres. During 2009 Apache and its joint interest partner drilled 41 horizontal wells. Four of these wells were completed and placed on production by year end 2009 and were producing at a combined gross rate in excess of 19 MMcf/d. Apache commenced stimulating the 16 wells on its first operated development pad in the fourth quarter of 2009, with production scheduled for mid 2010. A total of 55 wells are planned for completion in 2010. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2009, a new dehydration and compressor facility and a new 42 mile 24 inch sales line, with capacity of over 700 MMcf/d, was commissioned that will allow us to flow gas to a third party interconnect point when completed in 2010. Kitimat LNG Terminal The expected magnitude of the Horn River Basin resources and its remote location far from most major North American markets prompted Apache to seek alternative markets. In January 2010 we announced an agreement to acquire a 51 percent interest in Kitimat LNG, Incs. proposed LNG export terminal in British Columbia. We also reserved 51 percent of throughput capacity in the terminal. Planned plant capacity will be approximately 700 MMcf/d, or five million metric tons of LNG per day. This project has the potential to access new markets in the Asia Pacific region and allow Apache to monetize gas from its Canadian region, including its interest in the Horn River Basin in northeast British Columbia. A final investment decision is expected in 2011, with the first LNG shipments projected for as early as 2014. Apache will become the operator of the project. Preliminary gross construction cost estimates, which will be refined upon completion of a FEED study, total C$3 billion. Kitimat is designed to be linked to the pipeline system servicing Western Canadas natural gas producing regions via the proposed Pacific Trail 38 Table of Contents Pipelines, a project with a current estimated gross cost of C$1.1 billion. In association with our acquisition of interest in the Kitimat project, we also acquired a 25.5 percent interest in the proposed pipeline and 350 MMcf/d of capacity rights. Corridor Resources, Inc. Farm in In December 2009, we entered into a farm in agreement with Corridor Resources Inc. (Corridor) to appraise and potentially develop oil and natural gas resources in the province of New Brunswick, Canada. The initial 18 month program is intended to evaluate the commercial potential of natural gas development in the Frederick Brook formation and light oil development at a recent Caledonia oil discovery at a cost to Apache of not less than $25 million. Upon completion of this appraisal program, Apache will have earned a 50 percent working interest in the spacing units drilled. Apache will then have the option to participate in phase two of the program at a cost of not less than $100 million. Upon completion of this phase by March 31, 2013, Apache would earn a 50 percent interest in approximately 116,000 acres. North Sea Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 upon acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Production increased two percent in 2009, as gains from our drilling and workover programs more than offset unplanned downtime to replace an original vintage spool section at the end of the Bravo Charlie infield pipeline, which lowered production for the year by 2,690 boe/d. In addition to an active year of drilling, we completed and made significant progress on several important facility projects that will benefit Forties in the years ahead. The Delta Charlie infield pipeline was replaced, bringing improved mechanical integrity. We installed and commissioned a new power turbine on Delta to support increasing field water injection during 2010. On the Charlie platform, we purchased equipment, cleared access and began installing components late in 2009 for a new high pressure gas lift system that will be operational in early 2011. Work that began on the Echo platform several years ago to replace the antiquated and unreliable controls system with a modern version was fundamentally completed. The various facility upgrade and improvement projects completed in recent years resulted in a significant reduction in the number of occurrences of unplanned downtime. In 2009 we had fewer events causing unplanned downtime than we have experienced in any year since acquiring the Forties field; 64 percent less than our previous best year. Argentina Argentina announced several strategic agreements during 2009 that will improve the long term viability of our investments. Exploration Activity On March 30, 2009, Apache announced that the Neuqun Province of Argentina agreed to extend the term of eight federal oil and gas concessions for 10 additional years. Neuqun operations provide about half of Apaches total output in Argentina. The concessions encompass approximately 590,000 acres, including exploratory areas totaling 514,000 acres. In exchange for production that would have reverted to the Province beginning in six years and the right to explore for 10 additional years, Apache paid a bonus of approximately $23 million, increased the provincial royalty to 15 percent from 12 percent and will spend up to $320 million in future work programs over a 19 year period. Development Activity During 2009 Apache received technical and commercial approval from the government of Argentina for four Gas Plus projects and technical approval for two more Gas Plus projects designed to encourage new supplies through development of tight sands and unconventional gas reserves. Under the Gas Plus program, Apache has the opportunity to supply 10 MMcf/d from fields in the Neuqun Province at a price of $4.10 per MMBtu beginning January 2010 for an initial one year term. The Company also has a letter of intent for a contract to supply up to 50 MMcf/d from fields in the Neuqun and Rio Negro Provinces for $5.00 per MMBtu beginning January 2011. The gas supplying the Gas Plus program contracts is required to come from wells 39 Table of Contents drilled in the projects approved fields and formations. We believe this type of program, coupled with changing market conditions, point to improving price realizations going forward. Chile Exploration Activity In November 2007 Apache was awarded exploration rights on two blocks comprising approximately one million net acres on the Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego. This acreage is adjacent to our 552,000 net acres on the Argentine side of the island of Tierra del Fuego and represents a natural extension of our expanding exploration and production operations. The Lenga and Rusfin Blocks were ratified by the Chilean government on July 24, 2008. In January 2009 a 3 D seismic survey totaling 1,000 square kilometers was completed, and in November 2009 the first of a three well exploration program commenced drilling. Two of the wells reached total depth by year end 2009, with drilling completed on the third well in early 2010. Currently a completion rig is conducting testing and completion efforts on the three wells. During 2010 the region will invest approximately $25 million to $35 million for drilling and seismic acquisition.

(4) Reflects per Mcf increase of $.21 in 2009, reduction of $.01 in 2008 and increase of $.10 in 2007 from financial derivative hedging activities. Crude Oil Prices A substantial portion of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Prices we received for our crude oil in 2009 were 32 percent below 2008 with the worldwide economic downturn. Apache uses financial instruments to manage a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices, particularly in North America. In 2009, 10 percent of our oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges, increasing revenues by $45 million. In 2008, 19 percent of our oil production was hedged, reducing oil revenue by $451 million. For the year end status of our derivatives, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. While the market price received for crude oil varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade at a global price. With the exception of Argentina, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. In Australia, Apache continues to directly market all of our crude oil production into Australian domestic and international markets at prices indexed to Asian or Dated Brent benchmark crude oil prices, which typically track at or above NYMEX oil prices. In Argentina, we currently sell our oil in the domestic market. The Argentine government previously imposed a sliding scale tax on oil exports, which significantly influences prices domestic buyers are willing to pay. Domestic oil prices are currently indexed to a $42 per barrel base price, subject to quality adjustments and local premiums, and producers realize a gradual increase or decrease as market prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra del Fuego, similar pricing formulas exist, but producers retain a value added tax collected from buyers, effectively increasing price realizations by 21 percent. Natural Gas Prices Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. The majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing local market prices. Apache uses a variety of fixed price contracts and derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, primarily in North America. In 2009 nine percent of our gas production was subject to financial derivative hedges, increasing revenues by $136 million. In 2008 20 percent of our gas production was hedged, reducing gas revenue by $8 million. For the year end status of our derivatives, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. 43 Table of Contents Apache primarily sells natural gas into the North American market, where spot prices were cut in half compared to 2008, and various international markets, where our average contracted prices declined just 16 percent from 2008. Our primary markets include: 1) North America, which has a common market and where most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. 2) Egypt, where the majority of our gas is sold to EGPC under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMbtu. On up to 100 MMcf/d of gross production, there is no price cap for our gas under a legacy contract, which expires at the beginning of 2013. The region averaged $3.70 per Mcf in 2009. 3) Australia, which has a local market with mostly long term, fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in the local consumer price index. Natural gas discoveries are increasingly dedicated to the LNG market, and supply is tightening for delivery to the domestic market. As a result, recent contracts, including for our Reindeer field, are substantially higher than historical levels. 4) Argentina, where we receive government regulated pricing on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category. During 2009 we realized an average price of $1.07 per Mcf on government regulated sales. The majority of the remaining volumes were sold at market driven prices, which averaged $2.65 per Mcf in 2009. Our overall average realized price for 2009 was $1.96 per Mcf, 22 percent higher than 2008 average realized prices and 68 percent higher than 2007 average realized prices. During 2009 Apache received technical and commercial approval from the government of Argentina for four Gas Plus projects and technical approval for two more Gas Plus projects designed to encourage new supplies through development of tight sands and unconventional gas reserves. Under the Gas Plus program, Apache has the opportunity to supply 10 MMcf/d from fields in the Neuqun Province at a price of $4.10 per MMBtu beginning January 1, 2010 for an initial one year term. The Company also has a letter of intent for a contract to supply up to 50 MMcf/d from fields in the Neuqun and Rio Negro Provinces for $5.00 per MMbtu beginning January 1, 2011. The gas supplying the Gas Plus program contracts is required to come from wells drilled in the projects approved fields and formations. We believe this type of program, coupled with changing market conditions, point to improving price realizations going forward.

Crude Oil Revenues 2009 vs. 2008 Crude oil accounted for 48 percent of our equivalent production and 71 percent of oil and gas production revenues during 2009, compared to 48 and 66 percent, respectively, for 2008. Crude oil revenues for 2009 totaled $6.1 billion, $2.1 billion lower than 2008. The decrease was driven by a 32 percent decline in average realized prices ( $2.6 billion), mitigated by the impact of 10 percent production growth (+$528 million). Worldwide production increased 24.9 Mb/d despite curtailed capital spending, which was 40 percent lower than 2008. Egypts oil production increased 38 percent or 25.4 Mb/d on exploration successes in numerous concessions, most notably East Bahariya Extension, South Umbarka, Matruh, Northeast Abu Gharadig (NEAG) Extension and Khalda, waterflood projects and increased condensate from additional Qasr gas flowing through the new processing trains at the Salam Gas Plant. Australias production was up 1.5 Mb/d, as production was restored following completion of repairs at Varanus Island. North Sea production increased 1.5 Mb/d on strong drilling results, which offset the impact of unplanned downtime at the Bravo Platform, which lowered 2009 average daily oil production by 2.6 Mb/d. The Bravo Platform was down for most of the fourth quarter for pipeline repairs. Production declined 2.0 Mb/d in Canada, .9 Mb/d in Argentina and .7 Mb/d in the U.S., as natural decline offset results from our curtailed 2009 drilling programs. 2008 vs. 2007 Crude oil accounted for 48 percent of our equivalent production and 66 percent of our oil and gas production revenues for 2008, compared to 44 and 63 percent, respectively, for 2007. Crude oil revenues for 44 Table of Contents 2008 totaled $8.2 billion, increasing $1.9 billion on a 28 percent increase in average realized prices (+$1.7 billion) and a two percent production growth (+$175 million). Worldwide production was up 4.8 Mb/d, driven by increases in the North Sea and Egypt, which more than offset lower production in Australia, Canada and the U.S. Production in the North Sea was up 5.9 Mb/d (11 percent) on successful drilling and workover programs and a reduction in platform downtime. Egypts production increased 6.0 Mb/d (10 percent) on higher gross production from wells at El Diyur, Umbarka and East Bahariya and higher cost recovery from accelerated capital spending on a gas plant expansion. Argentine production was up 1.0 Mb/d on increased production from new wells in Tierra del Fuego. Australias production was down 5.5 Mb/d (40 percent), split between shut ins following a June 2008 pipeline explosion at the Varanus Island gas processing and transportation hub and natural decline. Canadas daily production was 1.6 Mb/d lower on natural decline and property divestitures, which more than offset drilling and recompletion activity. U.S. production declined 1.0 Mb/d. Production in the Gulf Coast region decreased 2.7 Mb/d; shut in production related to hurricanes reduced annual production by 6.9 Mb/d, offsetting net production growth from the regions drilling program. The Central regions production increased 1.7 Mb/d, driven by property acquisitions and drilling and recompletion activity. Natural Gas Revenues 2009 vs. 2008 Natural gas accounted for 50 percent of our equivalent production and 28 percent of our oil and gas production revenues during 2009, compared to 50 and 32 percent, respectively, for 2008. Gas revenues for 2009 totaled $2.4 billion, down $1.6 billion from 2008. All of the natural gas revenue decline occurred in North America, as a 25 percent increase in international production more than offset a 16 percent decline in international price realizations. Worldwide production grew 141 MMcf/d, driven by a 99 MMcf/d increase in Egypts net production and a 61 MMcf/d increase in Australia. Egypts gas production was up 38 percent on exploration successes at our Khalda and Matruh concessions and additional plant and pipeline capacity. Additional capacity provided by the combination of two new processing trains at the Salam Gas Plant and completion of a project to increase compression on the Northern Gas Pipeline allowed previously discovered wells in our Khalda Concession Qasr field to come online. The increased compression in the Northern Gas Pipeline also allowed increased throughput at the nearby Tarek plant and enabled us to begin producing previous discoveries at the Jade and Falcon fields in our Matruh concession. Australias 49 percent production increase was driven by production restorations following completion of repairs to the Varanus Island facility. Canadas gas production increased 6 MMcf/d from drilling and recompletion activities and a lower effective royalty rate, partially offset by natural decline. Argentine production decreased 11 MMcf/d on natural decline and lower capital spending levels. U.S. daily production declined 14 MMcf/d. Production in the Gulf Coast decreased 8 MMcf/d as production shut in for facility, rig and third party downtime repairs reduced the 2009 production by 30 MMcf/d, which more than offset net production gains from drilling results. Our Central regions production declined 6 MMcf/d primarily a result of the regions curtailed drilling program, which was deferred until service costs fell in line with lower commodity prices. Most of the regions drilling activity occurred in the second half of the year. 2008 vs. 2007 Gas accounted for 50 percent of our equivalent production and 32 percent of our oil and gas production revenues for 2008, compared to 53 and 35 percent, respectively, for 2007. Natural gas revenues in 2008 totaled $4.0 billion and were $461 million higher than 2007, reflecting a 25 percent increase in realized natural gas prices (+$887 million), which more than offset 10 percent lower production ( $426 million). Worldwide production decreased 179 MMcf/d. Australian production was down 72 MMcf/d. Volumes were impacted by production shut in after an explosion on an export pipeline and resulting fire that damaged our processing facilities. U.S. production was 90 MMcf/d lower. Gulf Coast daily production drove the lower U.S. production, with a decrease of 99 MMcf/d. The regions production was negatively impacted by properties shut in for hurricanes (55 MMcf/d) and facility, rig and third party downtime (27 MMcf/d), as well as the impact of a delay in the regions drilling program caused by the hurricanes. Central region production increased 10 MMcf/d on drilling and recompletion activities and from incremental volumes from Permian Basin properties acquired in March 2007. Canadas production decreased 35 MMcf/d on natural decline and property divestitures. Egypts gas production increased 23 MMcf/d (10 percent) on successful recompletions at our Matruh concession, new wells 45 Table of Contents brought online at the NEAG concession and higher cost recovery from accelerated capital spending on gas plant expansion. Operating Expenses The table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference expenses either on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on relevance. Amounts included in this table and in the discussion below are rounded to millions and may differ slightly from those presented elsewhere in this document. Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) (Per boe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment Recurring $ 2,202 $ 2,358 $ 2,208 $ 10.34 $ 12.06 $ 10.78 Additional 2,818 5,334 13.24 27.27 Other assets 193 158 140 .91 .81 .68 Asset retirement obligation accretion 105 101 96 .49 .52 .47 Lease operating expenses 1,662 1,909 1,653 7.81 9.76 8.07 Gathering and transportation 143 157 137 .67 .80 .67 Taxes other than income 579 985 598 2.72 5.03 2.92 General and administrative expenses 344 289 275 1.62 1.48 1.34 Financing costs, net 242 166 220 1.13 .85 1.07 Total $ 8,288 $ 11,457 $ 5,327 $ 38.93 $ 58.58 $ 26.00 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization The following table details the changes in recurring depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) of oil and gas properties between 2009 and 2007: Recurring DDA (In millions) 2007 $ 2,208 Volume change (127 ) Rate change 277 2008 $ 2,358 Volume change 150 Rate change (306 ) 2009 $ 2,202 2009 vs. 2008 Recurring full cost depletion expense decreased $156 million on an absolute dollar basis: $306 million on lower rate, partially offset by an increase of $150 million from higher production. Our full cost depletion rate decreased $1.72 to $10.34 per boe. The decrease in rate was driven by a $5.33 billion non cash write down of the carrying value of our December 31, 2008, proved property balances in the U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canada and Argentina and a $2.82 billion non cash write down of the carrying value of our March 31, 2009, proved oil and gas property balances in the U.S. and Canada. The impact of the write downs was partially offset by 2009 drilling and finding costs, which exceeded our historical cost basis. Under the full cost method of accounting, the Company is required to review the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DDA and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated 46 Table of Contents future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted 10 percent, net of related tax effects. Until December 31, 2009, the rules generally required pricing future net cash flows at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter. Effective December 31, 2009, estimated future net cash flows is calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2009, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. The rules also generally require the estimation of future costs using costs in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities. 2008 vs. 2007 During 2008, recurring full cost depletion expense increased $150 million, $277 million on rate, partially offset by $127 million on lower volumes. Our full cost depletion rate increased $1.28 to $12.06 per boe on drilling and finding costs that exceeded our historical cost basis. Higher industry wide costs, which also impacted estimates of future development costs, were driven by increased demand for drilling services, a consequence of higher oil and gas prices. Lease Operating Expenses Lease operating expenses (LOE) include several components: direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as labor, boats, helicopters, materials and supplies. Oil, which contributed nearly half of our production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote plants and facilities. All production in Australia and the North Sea and nearly 90 percent from the U.S. Gulf Coast region comes from offshore properties. Workovers accelerate production; hence, activity generally increases with higher commodity prices. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations generally impact the Companys LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding to per unit costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar lowering per unit costs in our international regions. 2009 vs. 2008 Our 2009 LOE decreased $247 million from 2008. LOE per boe was down 20 percent: 13 percent on lower cost and seven percent on higher production. The rate was impacted by the items below: Per boe 2008 LOE $ 9.76 Higher production (.68 ) Workover costs (.36 ) Foreign exchange rate impact (.33 ) Power and fuel (.32 ) Labor and pumper costs (.10 ) Hurricane repairs (.10 ) Other (.06 ) 2009 LOE $ 7.81 47 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Our 2008 LOE increased $256 million from 2007. LOE per boe was up 21 percent: 15 percent on higher cost and six percent on lower production. The rate was impacted by the items below: Per boe 2007 LOE $ 8.07 Lower production .45 Higher operating costs, including power and labor .33 Workover costs .29 Non recurring repairs and maintenance .07 Hurricane repairs .07 Varanus Island repair costs .03 Other .45 2008 LOE $ 9.76 Gathering and Transportation We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third party carrier and receive a price with no transportation deduction. In this case we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. In the U.S., Canada and Argentina, we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay transportation charges to a third party carrier. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs we paid directly to third party carriers for each of the periods presented: For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) U.S. $ 35 $ 39 $ 38 Canada 53 64 54 North Sea 26 28 27 Egypt 24 21 15 Argentina 5 5 3 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 143 $ 157 $ 137 Total Gathering and Transportation per boe $ .67 $ .80 $ .67 2009 vs. 2008 Gathering and transportation costs decreased $14 million from 2008. On a per unit basis, gathering and transportation costs were down 16 percent: nine percent on lower costs and seven percent on higher production. The decreases in the U.S. and Canada resulted from a decrease in both the volumes transported under arrangements where we pay costs directly to third parties and in rates. North Sea costs were down on foreign exchange rates. Egypt costs increased as a result of retroactive terminal fees claimed by EGPC, partially offset by a decrease in export cargoes as more crude oil was purchased by EGPC for domestic use in the latter part of 2009. 2008 vs. 2007 Gathering and transportation costs for 2008 increased $20 million from 2007. On a per unit basis, gathering and transportation costs were up 19 percent: 15 percent on higher costs and four percent on lower 48 Table of Contents production. The increase was driven primarily by higher transportation tariffs in Canada and an increase in Egyptian export volumes. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes other than income primarily comprises U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters off the coast of the U.S. and Australia and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. and Canada. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties field in the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes including U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum Resources Rent tax and various Canadian taxes including: Freehold Mineral tax, Saskatchewan Capital tax and Saskatchewan Resources surtax. We also pay taxes on invoices and bank transactions in Argentina. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses: For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) U.K. PRT $ 383 $ 695 $ 346 Severance taxes 88 168 142 Ad valorem taxes 55 71 56 Other taxes 53 51 54 Total Taxes other than income $ 579 $ 985 $ 598 Total Taxes other than income per boe $ 2.72 $ 5.03 $ 2.92 2009 vs. 2008 Taxes other than income were $406 million lower than 2008. On a per unit basis, they decreased 46 percent: 41 percent on lower costs and five percent on higher production. U.K. PRT was $312 million less than 2008 on a 43 percent decrease in net profits, driven by lower oil revenues and lower operating and capital costs. The decrease in severance taxes resulted from lower taxable revenues in the U.S., consistent with the lower realized oil and natural gas prices relative to the prior year. The $16 million decrease in ad valorem taxes resulted from lower taxable valuations associated with decreases in oil and natural gas prices. 2008 vs. 2007 Taxes other than income for 2008 were $387 million higher than 2007. On a per unit basis, they increased 72 percent: 65 percent on higher costs and seven percent on lower production. U.K. PRT was $349 million more than 2007 on a 98 percent increase in net profits, driven by higher oil revenues. The increase in severance taxes resulted from higher taxable revenues in the U.S., consistent with the higher realized oil and natural gas prices in the first nine months of the year. The $15 million increase in ad valorem taxes resulted from higher taxable valuations associated with increases in oil and natural gas prices at the time the taxes were assessed and a full year of taxes on the Permian Basin properties acquired in the first quarter of 2007. General and Administrative Expenses 2009 vs. 2008 General and administrative (GA) expenses were $55 million higher in 2009 than in 2008. On a per boe basis, GA expenses increased nine percent: 19 percent on higher costs, offset by a 10 percent reduction on higher volumes. The increase was driven by $39 million of nonrecurring charges related to the retirement of our founder and former chairman and employee separation costs related to a 2009 workforce reduction. Stock based compensation expense increased $34 million on the impact of higher stock appreciation relative to 2008 and new awards issued in 2009. Insurance premiums were up $9 million. These increases were partially offset by net reductions in other corporate expenses of $27 million. 2008 vs. 2007 GA expenses were $14 million higher in 2008 compared to 2007. On a per boe basis, GA expenses increased 10 percent: five percent on higher costs and five percent on lower volumes. The cost increase was driven by higher legal fees, especially in our international operations, increased incentive compensation 49 Table of Contents expenses and miscellaneous higher costs in several departments, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expenses related to cash settled stock appreciation rights. Financing Costs, Net Financing costs incurred during the periods noted are composed of the following: For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Interest expense $ 309 $ 280 $ 308 Amortization of deferred loan costs 6 4 3 Capitalized interest (61 ) (94 ) (75 ) Interest Income (12 ) (24 ) (16 ) Total Financing costs $ 242 $ 166 $ 220 Financing costs per boe $ 1.13 $ .85 $ 1.07 2009 vs. 2008 Financing costs, net increased $76 million from 2008. On a per unit basis, they increased 33 percent: 46 percent on higher costs, offset by a 13 percent reduction related to production growth. The increase in cost is primarily the result of a $29 million increase in interest expense related to higher average outstanding debt balances, a $33 million reduction in capitalized interest related to lower unproved property balances and completion of several long term construction projects, and a $12 million decrease in interest income on a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates. 2008 vs. 2007 Financing costs, net for 2008 decreased $54 million from 2007. On a per unit basis, they decreased 21 percent: 25 percent on lower costs and four percent on production growth. Interest expense was down $28 million on lower average outstanding debt balances. Capitalized interest was up primarily because of expenditures associated with long term construction projects under development. Provision for Income Taxes 2009 vs. 2008 There were no significant changes in statutory tax rates in the major jurisdictions in which the Company operates during 2009. The provision for income taxes totaled $611 million in 2009 compared to $220 million in 2008. Total taxes and the effective rates for each period were skewed by the magnitude of the taxes related to the 2009 and 2008 full cost write downs, the effect of currency exchange rates on our foreign deferred tax liabilities and other net tax settlements. Excluding these items, the 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates were comparable at 39.83 percent and 39.58 percent, respectively. 2008 vs. 2007 There were no significant changes in statutory tax rates in the major jurisdictions in which the Company operates during 2008. In 2007 we saw a significant reduction to deferred income taxes resulting from Canadian tax rate reductions. The provision for income taxes decreased $1.6 billion from 2007 to $220 million, as income before taxes decreased 80 percent as a result of the $5.3 billion in additional DDA recorded in conjunction with the ceiling test write down. The effective income tax rate for the year was 23.6 percent compared to 39.8 percent in 2007. The 2008 effective rate was impacted by the magnitude of the taxes related to the write down, non cash benefits related to the effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our foreign deferred tax liabilities and other net tax settlements. The 2007 effective rate was impacted by a non cash charge related to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign deferred tax liabilities. Partially offsetting this charge was an out of period benefit from Canadian federal tax rate reductions enacted in the second and fourth quarters of 2007. Excluding these items, the 2008 effective rate would have been comparable to the 2007 effective rate. 50 Table of Contents Non GAAP Measures The Company makes reference to some measures in discussion of its financial and operating highlights that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these measures in assessing operating results and believes the presentation of these measures provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations. These non GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used at other companies. Adjusted Earnings To assess the Companys operating trends and performance, management uses Adjusted Earnings, which is net income excluding certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Management believes this presentation may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts who adjust reported company earnings for items that may obscure underlying fundamentals and trends. The reconciling items below are the types of items management excludes and believes are frequently excluded by analysts when evaluating the operating trends and comparability of the Companys results. For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (In thousands, except per share data) Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stock (GAAP) $ (291,692 ) $ 706,274 Adjustments: Foreign currency fluctuation impact on deferred tax expense 197,724 (397,454 ) Additional depletion, net of tax(1) 1,981,398 3,647,745 Out of period tax adjustments (173,795 ) Adjusted Earnings (Non GAAP) $ 1,887,430 $ 3,782,770 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Non GAAP) Basic $ 5.62 $ 11.31 Diluted $ 5.59 $ 11.22 Average Number of Common Shares Basic 335,852 334,351 Diluted 337,737 337,191 (1) Additional depletion (non cash write down of the carrying value of proved property) recorded in 2009 was $2,818,161 pre tax, for which a deferred tax benefit of $836,763 was recognized. Also, additional depletion was recorded in 2008 totaling $5,333,821 pre tax, for which a deferred tax benefit of $1,686,076 was recognized. The tax effect of write down of the carrying value of proved property (additional depletion) in both 2009 and 2008 were calculated utilizing the statutory rates in effect in each country where a write down occurred. 51 Table of Contents Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures 2009 Activity During the second quarter of 2009 Apache announced the acquisition of nine Permian Basin oil and gas fields with then current net production of 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Marathon Oil Corporation for $187.4 million, subject to normal post closing adjustments. Estimated reserves acquired in connection with the acquisition totaled 19.5 MMboe. These long lived fields fit well with Apaches existing properties in the Permian Basin, particularly in Lea County, N.M., and will provide the Company many years of drilling opportunities. The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2009. 2008 Activity There was no major acquisition activity during 2008; however, the Company completed several divestiture transactions. On January 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359 on the outer continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to WT Offshore, Inc. for $116 million. On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas to Vanguard Permian, LLC for $78 million. On April 2, 2008, the Company completed the sale of non strategic Canadian properties to Central Global Resources for C$112 million. These divestitures were subject to normal post closing adjustments. 2007 Activity U.S. Gulf Coast Farm in On September 6, 2007, Apache entered into an Exploration Agreement with various EnerVest Partnerships (EVP) for an initial term of four years whereby Apache committed to spend $30 million in qualified expenditures to explore, drill, produce and market hydrocarbons from specified undeveloped formations across 400,000 net acres in Central and East Texas. As of December 31, 2008, Apache had fulfilled the $30 million commitment. U.S. Permian Basin On March 29, 2007, the Company closed its acquisition of controlling interest in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian Basin of West Texas from Anadarko for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these fields had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls) of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas as of year end 2006. The Company funded the acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko entered into a joint venture arrangement to effect the transaction. The Company entered into cash flow hedges for a portion of the crude oil and natural gas production. Capital Resources and Liquidity Net cash provided by operating activities (cash flows) is our primary source of liquidity. Our cash flows, both in the short term and the long term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices. Significant deterioration in commodity prices negatively impacts our revenues, earnings and cash flows, capital spending and potentially our liquidity if spending does not trend downward as well. Sales volumes and costs also impact cash flows; however, these historically have not been as volatile or as impactive as commodity prices in the short term. Our long term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company and our reserves, a critical source of future liquidity, will shrink. Cash investments are required continuously to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions, which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of our exploration and development activities or our ability to acquire additional reserves at reasonable costs. For a discussion of risk factors related to our business and operations, please see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. We may also elect to utilize available committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the occasional sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs. Apaches ability to access the debt and equity capital markets is supported by its investment grade credit ratings. 52 Table of Contents We believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to Apache, as discussed in the Liquidity section of this Capital Resources and Liquidity discussion, combined with internally generated cash flows, will be adequate to fund our short term and long term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Our primary uses of cash are exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs necessary to maintain ongoing operations, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. We fund our exploration and development activities primarily through net cash flows and budget our capital expenditures based on projected cash flows. See additional information, please see Part I, Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K. 53 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the years presented: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,224 $ 7,065 $ 5,677 Sales of short term investments 792 Sales of property and equipment 2 308 67 Project financing draw downs 250 100 Fixed rate debt borrowings 796 1,992 Common stock activity 29 32 30 Treasury stock activity 6 4 14 Other 29 40 26 5,332 8,345 7,806 Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Capital expenditures(1) 3,631 5,823 4,782 Purchase of short term investments 792 Acquisitions 310 150 1,025 Net commercial paper and bank loan repayments 2 200 1,412 Payments on fixed rate notes 100 173 Redemption of preferred stock 98 Dividends 209 239 205 Other 115 85 224 4,465 7,289 7,821 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 867 $ 1,056 $ (15 ) (1) The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows or cash flows) is our primary source of capital and liquidity and is impacted, both in the short term and the long term, by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices. Our average natural gas price realizations fluctuated throughout 2009, dipping from a high of $4.31 per Mcf in January to a low of $3.29 in September before increasing to $4.16 in December. Average realized prices in 2009 for natural gas fell 45 percent to $3.69 per Mcf. Our average crude oil realizations saw a gradual increase from a low of $40.24 per barrel in January 2009, peaking in November at $75.09, before falling back to $71.13 in December. Crude oil prices averaged $59.85 per barrel, down 32 percent from 2008. In order to manage the variability in cash flows, we increased our commodity hedge positions during the third and fourth quarters of 2009. At the end of 2009, we had hedged an average of just over 450,000 MMBtu per day of our projected 2010 North American natural gas production. The volumes were primarily hedged using fixed price swaps at an average price of approximately $5.65 per MMBtu. For perspective, the natural gas hedges represent 41 percent of fourth quarter 2009 North America daily gas production; 24 percent worldwide. We also had an average of just over 35,000 b/d of oil production hedged for 2010. Crude oil production was primarily hedged using collars that had average floor and ceiling prices of approximately $65.00 and $80.80 per barrel, respectively. For perspective, the oil hedges represent 13 percent of fourth quarter 2009 worldwide daily oil production. For additional information regarding our derivative contracts, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging 54 Table of Contents Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. For quantitative and qualitative information regarding our use of derivatives to manage commodity price risk, please see Commodity Risk in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10 K. The factors affecting operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non cash expenses such as DDA, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion and deferred income tax expense. For 2009 operating cash flows totaled $4.2 billion, down $2.8 billion from 2008. The primary driver of the reduction was a $3.8 billion decrease in oil and gas revenues, with the impact of lower commodity prices more than offsetting a nine percent increase in equivalent daily production. Also negatively impacting operating cash flows was the change in working capital from year end 2008 to year end 2009. These items were partially offset by the impact of a decline in cash based expenses and lower current taxes. For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, costs and expenses, please see Results of Operations in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non cash expenses which do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Short term Investments We occasionally invest in highly liquid, short term investments until funds are needed to further supplement our operating cash flows. At December 31, 2008, we had $792 million invested in U.S. Treasury securities with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year. These securities matured on April 2, 2009. None were held at December 31, 2009. Project Financing Draw downs One of the Companys Australian subsidiaries has a secured revolving syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments offshore Western Australia. The outstanding balance under the facility increased $250 million during the year to $350 million at December 31, 2009. For a more detailed discussion of this facility and information regarding our available committed borrowing capacity, please see Liquidity in this Item 7. Capital Expenditures We fund exploration and development activities primarily through operating cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected operating cash flows. Our operating cash flows, both in the short and long term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, management primarily relies on annual operating cash flow forecasts. Annual operating cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to these adjusted operating cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs. Historically, we have used a combination of our operating cash flows, borrowings under the our lines of credit and commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund significant acquisitions. 55 Table of Contents The following table details capital expenditures for each country in which we do business. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Exploration and Development: United States $ 929 $ 2,183 $ 1,631 Canada 412 705 651 North America 1,341 2,888 2,282 Egypt 676 853 605 Australia 602 880 516 North Sea 375 459 538 Argentina 140 318 287 Chile 11 27 International 1,804 2,537 1,946 Worldwide Exploration and Development Costs 3,145 5,425 4,228 Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities: Canada 83 29 24 Egypt 151 571 422 Australia 69 54 14 Argentina 2 5 13 Total Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facility Cost 305 659 473 Asset Retirement Costs 293 514 439 Capitalized Interest 61 94 76 Capital Expenditures, excluding Acquisitions 3,804 6,692 5,216 Acquisitions 310 150 1,025 Total Capital Expenditures $ 4,114 $ 6,842 $ 6,241 Exploration and Development (ED) As planned, our 2009 worldwide exploration and development (ED) expenditures were 42 percent lower than 2008. We reduced 2009 expenditures in response to the precipitous decline in commodity prices and the uncertainties surrounding the financial crisis in late 2008 and early in 2009, seeking to keep capital spending in line with 2009 operating cash flows. Consequently, our ED investments in all countries were down. ED spending in North America was 54 percent less than the prior year as we lowered activity and concentrated on identifying drilling opportunities and building inventory. Investments in Egypt were $177 million lower than the prior year as we scaled back drilling activity in the Western Desert. However, Egypts percentage of worldwide ED spending rose to 21 percent, up from 16 percent. Australias ED expenditures were 32 percent below 2008 on lower drilling activity and lower investments in platforms and production facilities. North Sea ED expenditures were $84 million lower as their investment requirements dropped following completion of several platform upgrades in 2008. Acquisitions We completed $310 million of acquisitions in 2009 compared to $150 million in 2008. Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive opportunities arise and, therefore, vary from year to year. Asset Retirement Costs In 2009 we recorded $293 million of additional future asset retirement costs associated with continued worldwide drilling programs, acquisition activity and further assessment of Hurricane Ike damages. Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities (GTP) We invested $305 million in GTP facilities in 2009 compared to $659 million in 2008. In Egypt we invested $151 million in gas processing facilities to alleviate 56 Table of Contents capacity constraints, which were restricting production. We also invested $69 million in Australia on GTP projects currently in process. In Canada, we invested $83 million in processing plants. 2010 Outlook In order to preserve our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, we plan to keep ED capital spending generally in line with 2010 operating cash flows. While funds have been committed for certain 2010 exploration drilling, long lead development projects and FEED studies, the majority of our drilling and development projects are discretionary and subject to acceleration, deferral or cancellation as conditions warrant. We will closely monitor commodity prices, service cost levels and predicted operating cash and will adjust our exploration and development budgets accordingly. However, with $2.0 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we have the flexibility to utilize this surplus for acquisitions or drilling and development projects that might otherwise not progress. Because we typically revise our exploration and development capital budgets throughout the year depending on prices, projecting future expenditures is somewhat difficult. Our current 2010 capital budget includes exploration and development capital of approximately $6.0 to $6.5 billion, including GTP. We generally do not project capital estimates for acquisitions because they are specific discrete events whose occurrence and timing is unpredictable. Any acquisitions could be funded from operating cash flow, credit facilities, new equity, or a combination thereof. Payments on Fixed rate Notes The $100 million Apache Finance Pty Ltd (Apache Finance Australia) 7.0 percent notes matured on March 15, 2009. The notes were repaid using existing cash balances. Redemption of Preferred Stock The Company redeemed with cash all of its 5.68 percent Cumulative Series B Preferred Stock on December 30, 2009. The 100,000 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were redeemed at a redemption price of $1,000 per share, plus $9.47 in accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 45 consecutive years through 2009. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. Common stock dividends paid during 2009 totaled $201 million, compared with $234 million in 2008 and $199 million in 2007. The 2008 period included a special non recurring cash dividend of 10 cents per common share paid on March 18, 2008. As discussed above, on December 30, 2009, the Company redeemed with cash all of its 5.68 percent Cumulative Series B Preferred Stock. As a result, the Company paid a total of $6.6 million of dividends, which includes two months of dividends accelerated because of the redemption. Also, in conjunction with the redemption of these shares, the Company was required to classify $1.6 million of the redemption amount ($100 million face value less $98.4 million carrying value) as preferred stock dividends. During 2008 and 2007 the Company paid $5.7 million of dividends each year. For additional information, please see Note 7 Capital Stock in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Liquidity At December 31, (Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated) 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,048 $ 1,181 Short term investments 792 Restricted cash 14 Total debt 5,067 4,922 Shareholders equity 15,779 16,509 Available committed borrowing capacity 2,300 2,550 Floating rate debt/total debt 7 % 2 % Percent of total debt to capitalization 24 % 23 % Our liquidity and financial position have not been materially affected by the ongoing turmoil in the credit markets. We believe that losses from non performance are unlikely to occur; however, we are not able to predict sudden changes in the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Twenty six of 27 banks with lending commitments to the Company have credit ratings of at least single A, which in some cases is 57 Table of Contents based on government support. There is no assurance that the financial condition of these banks will not deteriorate or that the government guarantee will be maintained. We closely monitor the ratings of the 27 banks in our bank group. Having a large bank group allows the Company to mitigate the impact of any banks failure to honor its lending commitment. Cash and Cash Equivalents We had $2.05 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, $1.4 billion of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries and approximately $650 million was held by Apache Corporation and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. Almost all of the cash is denominated in U.S. dollars and, at times, is invested in highly liquid, investment grade securities, with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We intend to use cash from our international subsidiaries to fund international projects. We held $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008. Short term Investments We occasionally invest in highly liquid, short term investments. As needed, we may reduce such short term investment balances to further supplement our operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, Apache held no short term investments. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $792 million invested in obligations of the U.S. government with original maturities greater than three months but less than a year. Restricted Cash The Company classifies cash balances as restricted cash when it is restricted as to withdrawal or usage. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $14 million of property divestiture proceeds classified as restricted cash and held in escrow available for use in a like kind exchange under Section 1031 of the U.S. federal income tax code. The Company expected to use these funds to purchase noncurrent assets. Accordingly, the restricted cash was classified as long term at year end. Subsequent to year end 2008 the time limits pursuant to Section 1031 expired and the funds were transferred to cash. As of December 31, 2009, no cash balances were classified as restricted cash. Debt At December 31, 2009, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes, debentures, uncommitted bank lines and project financing, totaled $5.1 billion. Current debt includes $110 million of loans under the Apache PVG Pty Ltd credit facility due in 2010 and $7 million borrowed under uncommitted overdraft lines in Argentina. We have $100 million of debt maturing in 2011, $480 million maturing in 2012, $945 million maturing in 2013, $15 million maturing in 2014, and the remaining $3.4 billion maturing intermittently in years 2015 through 2096. Debt to Capitalization Ratio The Companys debt to capitalization ratio as of December 31, 2009 was 24 percent. Available Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2009, the Company had unsecured committed revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling $2.3 billion, which mature in May 2013. The facilities consist of a $1.5 billion facility and a $450 million facility in the U.S., a $200 million facility in Australia and a $150 million facility in Canada. The $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities (U.S. credit facilities) also allow the company to borrow under competitive auctions. The U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apaches commercial paper program. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S. and Canada of up to five percent of the Companys consolidated assets, or approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2009. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group. There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non 58 Table of Contents appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2009. At the Companys option, the interest rate for the facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent or (ii) the London Inter bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the Companys senior long term debt rating. At December 31, 2009, the margin over LIBOR for committed loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and .23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the Companys senior long term debt rating. One of the Companys Australian subsidiaries has a secured revolving syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments offshore Western Australia. The facility provides for total commitments of up to $350 million, with availability determined by a borrowing base formula. The borrowing base was set at $350 million and will be redetermined after the fields commence production in the first half of 2010 and certain tests have been met, and semi annually thereafter. The facility is secured by certain assets associated with the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments, including the shares of stock of the Companys subsidiary holding the assets. The Company agreed to guarantee the credit facility until project completion occurs pursuant to terms of the facility, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2010. In the event project completion does not occur by December 31, 2010, pursuant to terms of the facility the lenders may require repayment of outstanding amounts in the first quarter of 2011. Interest is based on LIBOR, which may be subject to change under certain market disruption conditions, plus a margin of 1.00 percent pre completion and 1.75 percent post completion. The pre completion margin increases to 1.125 percent in the event the Companys ratings are downgraded to BBB+ or below by at least two major rating agencies. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there was $350 million and $100 million, respectively, outstanding under the facility. The commitments under the facility will be reduced by scheduled increments every six months beginning June 30, 2010, with final maturity on March 31, 2014. The outstanding amount under this facility must not exceed $300 million on June 30, 2010 and $240 million on December 31, 2010. Accordingly, $50 million and $60 million of the current balance will be repaid by June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010, respectively and has been classified as current debt at December 31, 2009. Commercial Paper Program The Company has available a $1.95 billion commercial paper program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. credit facilities are available as a 100 percent backstop. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under U.S. committed credit facilities, which expire in 2013. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had no outstanding commercial paper. Credit Ratings We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near term and long term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. Apaches senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated A3 by Moodys, A by Standard Poors and A by Fitch. The Company has received short term debt ratings for its commercial paper program of P 2 from Moodys, A 2 from Standard Poors and F2 from Fitch. In September 2009 Fitch downgraded Apaches senior unsecured long term debt and short term debt from A and F1 to A and F2, respectively. The current outlook at all three rating agencies is stable. A further ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt and potentially require the Company to post letters of credit in certain circumstances. 59 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 5 Debt and Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K.

(d) This table does not include the Companys tax reserves. For additional information regarding tax reserves, please see Note 6 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $27 million for environmental remediation and approximately $20 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. The Company also accrued approximately $63 million as of December 31, 2009, for an insurance contingency as a member of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). This insurance co op insures specific property, pollution liability and 60 Table of Contents other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay a withdrawal premium if we elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential withdrawal premium is calculated annually based on past losses and the nature of our asset base. The liability reflecting this potential charge has been fully accrued. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apaches financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of Apaches most critical accounting policies: Reserve Estimates In January 2009, the SEC issued Release No. 33 8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting (Release 33 8995), amending oil and gas reporting requirements under Rule 4 10 of Regulation S X and Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S K and bringing full cost accounting rules into alignment with the revised disclosure requirements. The new rules include changes to the pricing used to estimate reserves, the option to disclose probable and possible reserves, revised definitions for proved reserves, additional disclosures with respect to undeveloped reserves, and other new or revised definitions and disclosures. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010 03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (ASU 2010 03), which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas to align the guidance with the changes made by the SEC. The Company adopted Release 33 8995 and the amendments to ASC Topic 932 resulting from ASU 2010 03 (collectively, the Modernization Rules) effective December 31, 2009. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DDA expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. Reserves as of December 31, 2009 were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2009, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined 61 Table of Contents by contractual arrangements. Reserves as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 were estimated using prices in effect at the end of those years, in accordance with SEC guidance in effect prior to the issuance of the Modernization Rules. Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing. Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future, and contracts and regulation often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. ARO associated with retiring tangible long lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Income Taxes Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in six countries. As a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions meet certain legislative, judicial and regulatory requirements. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates, foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Commodity Risk The Companys revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very 62 Table of Contents volatile due to unpredictable events such as economical growth or retraction, weather and climate. Our average monthly crude oil realizations saw a gradual increase from a low of $40.24 per barrel in January 2009, peaking in November at $75.09, before falling back to $71.13 in December. In 2009 crude oil prices averaged $59.85 per barrel down 32 percent from 2008. Our average monthly natural gas price realizations fluctuated throughout 2009, dipping from a high of $4.31 per Mcf in January to a low of $3.29 in September before increasing to $4.16 in December. Average realized prices in 2009 for natural gas fell 45 percent to $3.69 per Mcf. For 2009 approximately nine percent of our natural gas production was subject to financial derivative hedges. In the third and fourth quarters of 2009, we entered into additional hedges on our 2010 projected North American gas production. For perspective, these 2010 hedges represent approximately 24 percent of our fourth quarter 2009 worldwide daily gas volumes and approximately 41 percent of our fourth quarter 2009 North American daily gas production. For 2009 approximately 10 percent of our crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges. In the third and fourth quarters of 2009, we entered into additional crude oil hedges on our 2010 projected production. For perspective, these 2010 hedges represent approximately 13 percent of our fourth quarter 2009 worldwide daily oil volumes. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. On December 31, 2009, the Company had open natural gas derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of $56 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately $128 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately $127 million. The Company also had open oil derivatives in a liability position with a fair value of $322 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would increase the liability by approximately $202 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would decrease the liability by approximately $190 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2009. For notional volumes and terms associated with the Companys derivative contracts, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the President (principal financial officer), General Counsel, Treasurer and other key members of Apaches management, approve and oversee these controls, which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit, limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Interest Rate Risk On December 31, 2009, the Companys debt with fixed interest rates represented approximately 93 percent of total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately seven percent of Apaches debt will fluctuate based on short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating interest rates on year end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately $537,000. Foreign Currency Risk The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and gas production is sold largely under fixed price Australian dollar contracts. Approximately half the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in U.S. dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars but 63 Table of Contents converted into Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds and Argentine pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of Other under Revenues and Other or, as is the case when we re measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Companys provision for income tax expense on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. A 10 percent strengthening or weakening of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Egyptian pound or Argentine peso as of December 31, 2009, would result in a foreign currency net loss or gain, respectively, of approximately $95 million.
