ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops and produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. We currently have exploration and production interests in seven countries: the U.S., Egypt, Australia, offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea), Argentina and Chile. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K, and the Risk Factors information set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Executive Overview Strategy Apaches mission is to grow a profitable global exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long term benefit of our shareholders. Apaches long term perspective has many dimensions, with the following core strategic components: balanced portfolio of core assets; conservative capital structure; and rate of return focus. A cornerstone of our strategy is balancing our portfolio through diversity of geologic risk, geographic risk, hydrocarbon mix (crude oil versus natural gas) and reserve life in order to achieve consistency in results. Our portfolio of geographic locations provides variation of all of these factors and, additionally, in the case of Australia and Argentina, the potential for increasing the value of our investments through rising natural gas prices. By maintaining a balanced hydrocarbon mix, we are protecting against price deterioration in a given product while retaining upside potential through a significant increase in either commodity price. For example, in 2010 oil and liquids provided 52 percent of our production but 77 percent of our total oil and gas revenues. We were well positioned to realize the benefit of higher oil prices, enabling record financial results despite North America natural gas prices that were under pressure most of the year. Each operating region has a significant producing asset base as well as large undeveloped acreage positions which provide room for growth through sustainable lower risk drilling opportunities, balanced by higher risk, higher reward exploration. We closely monitor drilling and acquisition cost trends in each of our core areas relative to product prices and, when appropriate, adjust our budgets accordingly. We review capital allocations, at least quarterly, through a disciplined and focused process of reviewing internally generated drilling prospects, opportunities for tactical acquisitions, land positions with additional drilling prospects or, occasionally, new core areas which could enhance our portfolio. In addition, we actively seek to identify and pursue ways to maintain efficient levels of costs and expenses. Our overall approach to managing cash expenditures has enabled us to consistently deliver strong results with 2010 return on average capital employed and return on equity of 12 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Preserving financial flexibility is also important to our overall business philosophy. We ended 2010 with a year end debt to capitalization ratio of 25 percent, an increase of only one percent from the prior year despite current year capital investments of $17 billion, including acquisitions totaling more than $11 billion. Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategic principles have underpinned our ability to deliver production, reserve growth and competitive investment rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders. Delivering successful results under this strategy is bolstered by Apaches unique culture. A strong sense of urgency, empowerment of our employees, effective incentive systems and an independent mindset are at the heart of how we build value. 36 Table of Contents Financial and Operating Results While Apache has grown into a much larger company than it was a year ago, we have stayed true to our business model, focusing on rate of return and cash generating assets. Although the year 2010 will be remembered for the level of acquisition activity, the record financial results reflected continued growth and positive returns. For the 12 month period ending December 31, 2010, Apache reported record performances in several key metrics. Highlights for the year include: Annual daily production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids averaged a record 658,000 boe/d, up 13 percent compared with 2009. Production in fourth quarter 2010 averaged 729,000 boe/d, an increase of 24 percent from the 590,000 boe/d averaged in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oil and gas production revenues for 2010 increased 42 percent to $12.1 billion, up from $8.6 billion in 2009, and just shy of the record $12.3 billion in 2008 when prices reached record levels. Apache reported a record $3 billion in net income, or $8.46 per common diluted share, compared to a net loss of $292 million, or $.87 per share in the 2009 period. Apaches 2009 results were impacted by a $1.98 billion after tax write down of the carrying value of proved property. Apaches 2010 reported adjusted earnings(1), which exclude certain items impacting the comparability of results, were approximately $3.17 billion or $8.94 per common diluted share, up from $1.89 billion or $5.59 per common diluted share in the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows or cash flows) totaled $6.7 billion, up 60 percent from $4.2 billion in 2009. Estimated proved reserves at year end 2010 were a record 2,953 MMboe, up 25 percent from 2009 estimated proved reserves of 2,367 MMboe. (1) See Non GAAP Measures Adjusted Earnings for a description of Adjusted Earnings, which is not a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure, and a reconciliation to this measure from Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stock, which is presented in accordance with GAAP. 2011 Outlook As we head into 2011, we project Apaches financial position will remain strong, given our debt to capitalization ratio of 25 percent, $2.4 billion of available committed borrowing capacity, projections of higher cash flows than 2010 levels and determination to hold exploration and development spending within our internally generated cash flows. Given the present price disparity between oil and natural gas, our near term focus is exploiting the oily and more liquids rich properties in our portfolio and development of our gas resources in Australia and Canada, which we plan to convert to LNG and sell in the worldwide LNG market. As is the Apache way, rates of return will drive our decision making while we continue our focus on costs, operational efficiency and integrating the acquired assets. In 2011 we find ourselves with more opportunities than we can fund through internally generated cash flow, and our challenge will be to optimize capital spending across our worldwide portfolio. Our current 2011 capital budget includes exploration and development capital of approximately $7.5 billion. Nearly $4.0 billion is expected to be spent on projects in North America, with the remaining amount allocated across our international regions. An estimated one third of our global capital budget is allocated to seismic and leasehold, GTP facilities and plugging and abandonment activities. While funds have been committed for certain 2011 exploration drilling, long lead development projects and FEED studies, the majority of our drilling and development projects are discretionary and subject to acceleration, deferral or cancellation as conditions warrant. We closely monitor commodity prices, service cost levels, regulatory impacts and other numerous industry factors and will adjust our exploration and development budgets based on changes to predicted operating cash flow. We typically review and revise our exploration and development capital budgets on a quarterly basis. Based on the current capital spending budget and the acquisitions completed during 2010, Apache expects to increase overall production in 2011 between 13 percent and 17 percent from full year 2010 production levels. These projections exclude the impact from any potential acquisitions or divestitures. 37 Table of Contents The Company is currently planning to divest approximately $1.0 billion of properties to optimize and high grade our existing portfolio of assets. The divestiture package will most likely include legacy conventional properties in Canada. However, as of the date of this filing we have not entered into any binding contracts to sell these assets. We generally do not budget for acquisitions because they are specific, discrete events whose occurrence and timing is unpredictable. Acquisitions may be funded from operating cash flows, credit facilities, new equity, debt issuances or a combination thereof. Operating Highlights Current Year During 2010 we completed more than $11 billion of acquisitions, continued progress on developing existing core properties and expanded into new geographic areas. Through these steps, we added significantly to drilling inventory in our core areas and established a footprint in two new areas: deepwater exploration and LNG, which for us means the monetization of large gas resources at oil linked prices. Merger and Acquisitions of Property and Acreage From 2007 to 2009 we were relatively absent from the acquisition market. We believed the market was overheated as oil and gas prices spiked, and the opportunities we identified did not meet our criteria for risk, reward and or growth potential. We built our cash position while drilling our existing inventory of prospects and waiting for the right transactions to supplement it. In June we completed the $1.05 billion acquisition of Devon Energy Corporations oil and gas assets on the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) shelf, 75 percent of which are in fields now operated by Apache. The acquired assets include 477,000 net acres across 150 blocks. The Company believes that these well maintained, high quality assets fit well with Apaches existing infrastructure and play to the strengths that come with our experience operating on the shelf, exploiting the current production base and capturing upside potential. In August we completed the $2.5 billion acquisition of oil and gas operations, acreage and infrastructure in the Permian Basin from BP plc (BP), solidifying our position as one of the most active operators in the area, where Apache has been competing for 20 years. The acquisition more than doubled our footprint in the Permian Basin to over three million gross acres. In October we completed the $3.25 billion acquisition of substantially all of BPs upstream natural gas business in western Alberta and British Columbia, including 1.3 million net mineral and leasehold acres with significant positions in several emerging unconventional plays, such as the Noel tight gas project, which ramped up to 100 MMcf/d by the end of the fourth quarter. We own a 100 percent working interest in the Noel project. In November we closed on the purchase of BP assets in Egypts Western Desert for $650 million, acquiring four development leases and one exploration concession as well as strategically positioned infrastructure that will enable Apache to increase production from existing fields in the Western Desert. Also in November, shareholders of Mariner Energy, Inc. (Mariner) approved the purchase of their company by Apache for stock and cash consideration totaling $2.7 billion. We also assumed approximately $1.7 billion of Mariners debt with the merger. Apache established a strategic presence in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and expanded our positions in the GOM shelf, Gulf Coast and Permian Basin with the acquisition. The acquisition also provides deepwater geoscience expertise, including a core competency in subsea tieback developments, which can significantly reduce the cycle time between exploration success and initial production. During the first quarter of 2010 Apache Canada Ltd. (Apache Canada), through its subsidiaries, closed the acquisition of a 51 percent interest in a planned LNG export terminal (Kitimat LNG facility) and a 25.5 percent interest in a partnership that owns a related proposed pipeline. EOG Resources Canada, Inc. (EOG 38 Table of Contents Canada) owns the remaining 49 percent of the Kitimat LNG facility and a 24.5 percent interest in the pipeline partnership. In February 2011 Apache Canada and EOG Canada entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 50 percent interest in the partnership. Upon close of the transaction, Apache Canada and EOG Canada will own 51 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of the pipeline partnership and proposed pipeline. In Australia, during 2010 we expanded our exploration opportunities in the Carnarvon and Exmouth basins via farm ins to seven permits. The transactions resulted in a 58 percent increase in our net undeveloped acreage in the Carnarvon basin and added 1.9 million acres for exploration in the Exmouth basin. We will operate all of them with a 20 to 70 percent working interest. In the North Sea, we expanded our acreage position during the year through successful bids on four exploration licenses and farming into two additional licenses with a 50 percent working interest. Egypt 2X Gross Production Achievement Apaches Egypt operations had another year of growth in 2010, with gross daily production rising 16 percent to 322.5 Mboe/d and net daily production rising six percent to an average of 161.7 Mboe/d for the year. During the year the Company surpassed its late 2005 goal of doubling its Western Desert production within five years. Achievement of the goal was driven in part by production from several discoveries in the Faghur and Matruh basins, infrastructure improvements including two new Salam gas trains, expansion of the capacity of the Kalabsha oil processing and transportation facilities to 40,000 b/d and completion of a major strategic compression project on Egypts northern gas pipeline. The Faghur and Matruh basins, where the thickness of the sands and the stacked pay zones present multiple opportunities for further exploration across our acreage, will continue to be focus areas for Apache in 2011. Van Gogh and Pyrenees Oil Fields Development Australias 2010 production averaged a record 79.2 Mboe/d, driven by the Apache operated Van Gogh oil field and BHP Billiton operated Pyrenees oil field, both of which commenced production early in 2010. The Van Gogh and Pyrenees developments utilize Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels and together added 42.2 Mb/d to Apaches 2010 net oil production. Both projects have already reached payout. Organic Growth Drivers 2011 to 2013 Australia Reindeer Field Development and Devil Creek Gas Plant Our Reindeer field discovery is projected to commence production in 2011 upon completion of the Devil Creek Gas Plant. The Devil Creek Gas Plant is scheduled to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2011. This will be Western Australias first new domestic natural gas processing hub in more than 15 years. The two train plant is designed to process 200 MMcf/d from the Apache operated Reindeer Field. In 2009 we entered into a gas sales contract covering a portion of the fields future production. Under the contract, Apache and our joint venture partner agreed to supply 154 Bcf of gas over seven years (approximately 60 MMcf/d) beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 at prices substantially higher than we have historically received in Western Australia. Apache owns a 55 percent interest in the field. Australia Halyard Field Development Initial production from our Halyard 1 discovery well in Australia is projected for 2011 upon completion of the tie in to the existing gas facilities on Varanus Island. The extension of this subsea infrastructure will also connect the 2010 Spar 2 discovery and allow for tie in of future wells. North Sea Satellite Platform In November Apache entered into a contract to build a new satellite oil production platform for our UK Forties field. The new platform will be bridge linked to our existing Forties Alpha installation in the Apache operated field, located on the U.K. continental shelf. This project will provide Apache with 18 new slots for drilling additional development wells to increase the ultimate recovery from the Forties field. The satellite platform will also expand 39 Table of Contents critical utility services to the field, including power generation, produced fluid processing, high pressure gas compression for artificial lift and dehydration. Construction is projected to be complete by mid year 2012. Australia Macedon Field Development The Macedon gas fields four development wells, which were completed in 2010, will be delivered via a 60 mile pipeline to a 200 MMcf/d gas plant to be built at Ashburton North in Western Australia. We have a 28 percent non operated working interest in the field. The project, approved in 2010, is currently underway, with first production projected in 2013. Australia Coniston Oil Field Discovery The Coniston field is an oil accumulation near our Van Gogh field in Australia. Apache drilled 10 appraisal wells during 2009, and current plans call for subsea completions tied back to the Van Gogh field FPSO Ningaloo Vision. The project has been sanctioned for development, with first production into the domestic market projected in 2013. North America Unconventional Gas Plays The identification and development of significant resources in shale formations and other unconventional gas plays have introduced substantial gas supplies into North American natural gas markets for the foreseeable future. Although Apaches current production in North America is primarily conventional, near term gas production growth will likely be driven by our activity in three large unconventional plays: shale gas in British Columbias Horn River basin, tight sands in British Columbias Noel area and the Granite Wash tight sands in the Anadarko basin of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Horizontal Drilling and Completion Techniques Apache continues to evaluate horizontal drilling potential across our acreage positions around the world, in both conventional and unconventional reservoirs. In the Permian Basin, Apache is utilizing horizontal drilling to access bypassed, unswept zones in established waterfloods. We are currently drilling our first horizontal shale well in Argentina, targeted for completion in April. In addition, we plan to drill our first horizontal well in the Western Desert of Egypt in 2011. The Company will continue to evaluate our opportunities utilizing horizontal drilling technology. Organic Growth Drivers 2014 and Beyond Australia Balnaves Oil Field Discovery Development In October 2010 we announced three successful wells appraising our Balnaves 1 discovery, an oil accumulation in a separate reservoir beneath the large gas reservoirs of our Brunello gas fields (discussed below). The project is currently in the FEED stage, with plans to develop the field through a new FPSO. First production, if the decision is made to go forward with the project, is projected for 2014. Julimar and Brunello Field Discoveries Development/Wheatstone LNG Project In 2016, we are projecting to begin production from our operated Julimar and Brunello field gas discoveries through the Chevron operated Wheatstone LNG hub, in which we own a foundation equity partner interest of 13 percent. Apaches projected net gas sales from the fields are 160 MMcf/d and 3,250 b/d with a projected 15 year production plateau when the multi year project is fully operational. The Wheatstone project, which is currently in FEED, will convert the gas into LNG for sale on the world market. World LNG prices are typically oil linked prices and are currently higher than the historical gas prices in Western Australia. The project Final Investment Decision (FID) is scheduled for 2011, with first LNG projected in 2016. Nonbinding Heads of Agreements have been signed with LNG buyers and final binding sales and purchase agreements will be completed by FID. 40 Table of Contents Kitimat/Horn River Basin Development Apaches time horizon and magnitude of our Horn River basin shale gas development is impacted by North American gas prices and the completion of the Kitimat LNG facility and a related proposed pipeline. The project has the potential to open new markets linked to oil prices in the Asia Pacific region for gas from Apaches Canadian operations, including the Horn River basin area in northeast British Columbia. Apache Canada and EOG Canada plan to build the Kitimat LNG facility on Bish Cove near the Port of Kitimat, 400 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia. The facility is planned for an initial minimum capacity of 700 MMcf/d, or five million metric tons of LNG per year, of which Apache Canada has reserved 51 percent. The proposed 287 mile pipeline will originate in Summit Lake, British Columbia, and is designed to link the Kitimat LNG facility to the pipeline system currently servicing western Canadas natural gas producing regions. Apache Canada will have rights to 51 percent of the capacity in the proposed pipeline. Completion of the FEED study and a final investment decision are targeted for late 2011. Construction is expected to commence in 2012, with commercial operations projected to begin in 2015. GOM Deepwater Apache has built deepwater experience and a record of success in Egypt, Australia and the Gulf of Mexico, on both the exploration and development sides. The GOM deepwater portfolio gained in the Mariner merger adds over 100 blocks and offers a strategic position into a significant potential growth area in the United States that can add meaningful oil reserves and production over the long term. Exploration potential is generated from Mariners extensive track record of 36 deepwater development projects completed to date and the technological developments in seismic and facilities making exploration more predictable, lower risk and lower cost. Our pipeline of development projects include the non operated Heidelberg (12.5 percent net working interest) and Lucius (16.67 percent net working interest) discoveries, which are still under further appraisal and study for ultimate development. Significant Events Impact of Deepwater Drilling Moratorium on Gulf of Mexico Operations In 2010 the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) announced a series of moratoria, which directed oil and gas lessees and operators to cease drilling new deepwater (depths greater than 500 feet) wells on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), and put oil and gas lessees and operators on notice that, with certain exceptions, the BOEMRE would not consider drilling permits for deepwater wells and related activities. While the moratoria have been formally lifted, no new permits for deepwater drilling have been issued as of the date of this filing. In addition, the BOEMRE issued new regulations in 2010 requiring additional information, documentation and analysis for all new wells on the OCS. The effect of these new regulations was to significantly slow down issuance of permits for shallow wells. Apache continues to operate under these new regulations and, through February 2011, has received 25 drilling permits for shallow wells. Current permitting activity has been slowed compared to prior year levels, and the Company has budgeted its exploration and development activity accordingly. Impact of Recent Political Changes on Egyptian Operations In 2010 our operations in Egypt contributed 28 percent of our production revenue, 25 percent of total production and 10 percent of total estimated proved reserves. In 2010 we sold all of our Egyptian gas production and 34 percent of our Egyptian oil production to Egyptian General Petroleum Company (EGPC), the Egyptian state owned oil company. The remainder of our oil was sold in the export market. As a result of political unrest, protests, riots, street demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience that began on January 25, 2011, in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped down, effective February 11, 2011. The Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces assumed power. On February 13, 2011, the Council announced that the constitution would be suspended, both houses of parliament would be dissolved, and the military would rule for six months until elections can be held. Following the advice of the U.S. State Department, Apache evacuated all non essential personnel from Egypt. As conditions stabilized, approximately one third of the 41 Table of Contents evacuated employees returned. Apaches production, located in remote locations in the Western Desert, has continued uninterrupted; however, further changes in the political, economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization and or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Apache purchases multi year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and highly rated international insurers covering its investments in Egypt. In the aggregate, these policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $1 billion of coverage to Apache covering losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks and currency inconvertibility. In addition, the Company has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $300 million of coverage for losses arising from (1) non payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum when actions taken by the Government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. Operations Downtime Production from our Van Gogh oil field was impacted by essential maintenance activities on the FPSO. Net fourth quarter production of 6,100 b/d was down 17,600 b/d from the previous quarter. Production resumed in the first half of February 2011. In January 2011 a subsea pipeline connecting our Forties Bravo platform to our Charlie platform was shut in because of corrosion. A project is underway to re route the production through a smaller line until a new flexible pipeline is installed. This intermediate solution should be completed by the first of March 2011 and will allow us to produce approximately half of the 11,600 b/d that flowed through the main pipeline. The new main subsea pipeline will be completed by September 2011. 42 Table of Contents Results of Operations Oil and Gas Revenues For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % % % $ Value Contribution $ Value Contribution $ Value Contribution (In millions) (In millions) (In millions) Oil Revenues: United States $ 2,683 30 % $ 1,922 32 % $ 2,751 34 % Canada 388 4 % 311 5 % 587 7 % North America 3,071 34 % 2,233 37 % 3,338 41 % Egypt 2,875 32 % 2,063 34 % 2,232 27 % Australia 1,296 14 % 230 4 % 277 3 % North Sea 1,590 18 % 1,356 22 % 2,085 26 % Argentina 209 2 % 207 3 % 225 3 % International 5,970 66 % 3,856 63 % 4,819 59 % Total(2) $ 9,041 100 % $ 6,089 100 % $ 8,157 100 % Natural Gas Revenues: United States $ 1,409 49 % $ 1,054 44 % $ 2,204 56 % Canada 647 23 % 546 23 % 1,026 26 % North America 2,056 72 % 1,600 67 % 3,230 82 % Egypt 495 17 % 490 21 % 507 13 % Australia 163 6 % 133 6 % 95 2 % North Sea 16 0 % 13 0 % 18 0 % Argentina 132 5 % 133 6 % 115 3 % International 806 28 % 769 33 % 735 18 % Total(3) $ 2,862 100 % $ 2,369 100 % $ 3,965 100 % Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Revenues: United States $ 208 74 % $ 74 64 % $ 128 62 % Canada 39 14 % 20 17 % 38 19 % North America 247 88 % 94 81 % 166 81 % Egypt 2 1 % 0 % 0 % Argentina 31 11 % 22 19 % 40 19 % International 33 12 % 22 19 % 40 19 % Total $ 280 100 % $ 116 100 % $ 206 100 % Total Oil and Gas Revenues: United States $ 4,300 35 % $ 3,050 36 % $ 5,083 41 % Canada 1,074 9 % 877 10 % 1,651 14 % North America 5,374 44 % 3,927 46 % 6,734 55 % Egypt 3,372 28 % 2,553 30 % 2,739 22 % Australia 1,459 12 % 363 4 % 372 3 % North Sea 1,606 13 % 1,369 16 % 2,103 17 % Argentina 372 3 % 362 4 % 380 3 % International 6,809 56 % 4,647 54 % 5,594 45 % Total(1) $ 12,183 100 % $ 8,574 100 % $ 12,328 100 % (1) Financial derivative hedging activities increased oil and gas production revenues for 2010 and 2009 by $165.3 million and $180.8 million, respectively, and decreased oil and gas production revenues for 2008 by $458.7 million. 43 Table of Contents (2) Financial derivative hedging activities decreased 2010 oil revenues by $57.0 million, increased 2009 oil revenues by $45.2 million and decreased 2008 oil revenues by $450.8 million.

Crude Oil Prices A substantial portion of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Companys control. Prices we received for crude oil in 2010 were 28 percent above 2009 with economies stabilizing or growing across the globe. Apache uses financial instruments to manage a 45 Table of Contents portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices, particularly in North America. In 2010, 12 percent of our oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges, reducing revenues by $57 million. In 2009, 10 percent of our oil production was hedged, increasing oil revenue by $45 million. For the year end status of our derivatives, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. While the market price received for crude oil varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade at a global price. With the exception of Argentina, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. In Australia, Apache continues to directly market all of our crude oil production into Australian domestic and international markets at prices indexed to Dated Brent benchmark crude oil prices plus a premium, which are typically above NYMEX oil prices. In Argentina, we currently sell our oil in the domestic market. The Argentine government imposes a sliding scale tax on oil exports, which significantly influences prices domestic buyers are willing to pay. Domestic oil prices are currently indexed to a $42 per barrel base price, subject to quality adjustments and local premiums, and producers realize a gradual increase or decrease as market prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra del Fuego, similar pricing formulas exist, but producers retain a value added tax collected from buyers, effectively increasing price realizations by 21 percent. Natural Gas Prices Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. The majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing local market prices. Apache uses a variety of fixed price contracts and derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, primarily in North America. In 2010, 23 percent of our gas production was subject to financial derivative hedges, increasing revenues by $222 million. In 2009, nine percent of our gas production was hedged, increasing gas revenue by $136 million. For the year end status of our derivatives, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Apache primarily sells natural gas into the North American market, where spot prices increased 17 percent compared to 2009, and various international markets, where our average contracted prices rose just one percent from 2009. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, Australia and Argentina. North America has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. In Egypt our gas is sold to EGPC, with a majority under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMBtu. On up to 100 MMcf/d of gross production, there is no price cap for our gas under a legacy contract, which expires at the end of 2012. Overall, the region averaged $3.62 per Mcf in 2010. Australia has a local market with a limited number of buyers and sellers resulting in mostly long term, fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in the local consumer price index. Recent increases in demand and higher development costs have increased the prices required from the local market in order to support the development of new supplies. As a result, market prices received on recent contracts, including our Reindeer field, are substantially higher than historical levels. In Argentina we receive government regulated pricing on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category. During 2010 we realized an average price of $1.20 per Mcf on government regulated sales. The majority of the remaining volumes were sold at market driven prices, which averaged $2.65 per Mcf in 2010. Our overall average realized price for 2010 was $1.96 per Mcf, the same as our 2009 average realized price and 22 percent higher than 2008 average realized price ($1.61 per Mcf). During 2010 Apache signed three Gas Plus contracts totaling 63 MMcf/d of gross production from fields in the Neuqun and Rio Negro Provinces. Gas Plus is a program instituted by the Argentine government to encourage new gas supplies through the development of tight sands and unconventional reserves. The first contract, for 10 MMcf/d at $4.10 per MMBtu, has been extended through 2011 for 11 MMcf/d at $4.10 per 46 Table of Contents MMbtu. Our other two Gas Plus contracts, for a total of 53 MMcf/d at $5.00 per MMBtu, are projected to commence in the first quarter of 2011. The gas supplying the Gas Plus program contracts is required to come from wells drilled in the projects approved fields and formations. We believe the Gas Plus program, coupled with changing market conditions, point to improving price realizations going forward.

Crude Oil Revenues 2010 vs. 2009 During 2010 crude oil revenues totaled $9.0 billion, $2.9 billion higher than the 2009 total of $6.1 billion, driven by a 16 percent increase in worldwide production and a 28 percent increase in average realized prices. Average daily production in 2010 was 322.9 Mb/d, with prices averaging $76.69 per barrel. Crude oil represented 74 percent of our 2010 oil and gas production revenues and 49 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 71 and 48 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Higher realized prices contributed $1.7 billion to the increase in full year revenues, while higher production volumes added another $1.2 billion. Worldwide oil production increased 44.2 Mb/d, driven by a 36.1 Mb/d increase in Australia on new production from the Van Gogh and Pyrenees discoveries, which were brought online in the first quarter of 2010. U.S. production increased eight percent, or 7.4 Mb/d, with the Permian region up 4.4 Mb/d on properties added from the BP acquisitions, the Mariner merger and drilling and recompletion activity. The Gulf Coast region added 1.8 Mb/d from properties acquired in the Devon acquisition, the Mariner merger and drilling and recompletion activity. Central region production increased 1.2 Mb/d on drilling and recompletion activity. Gross production in Egypt increased 17 percent, while net production was up only eight percent, a function of the mechanics of our production sharing contracts. Net production increased 7.0 Mb/d on production gains in the Shushan, Matruh and numerous other concessions. Additional capacity at the Kalabsha oil processing facility, as well as processing of condensate rich gas through the Salam Gas Plant allowed by the new Jade manifold, allowed for much of the production gains. North Sea production decreased 4.2 Mb/d on natural decline and downtime. Production in Argentina and Canada declined 1.5 Mb/d and .6 Mb/d, respectively, on natural decline. 2009 vs. 2008 Crude oil accounted for 48 percent of our equivalent production and 71 percent of oil and gas production revenues during 2009, compared to 48 and 66 percent, respectively, for 2008. Impacted by dramatically lower oil prices realized during the global financial crisis that began in late 2008, crude oil revenues for 2009 totaled $6.1 billion, $2.1 billion lower than the prior year. A 32 percent decline in average realized prices reduced revenues $2.6 billion, of which $528 million was offset by the impact of 10 percent production growth. Worldwide production increased 24.9 Mb/d despite curtailed capital spending, which was 40 percent lower than 2008. Egypts oil production increased 38 percent or 25.4 Mb/d on exploration successes in numerous concessions, most notably East Bahariya Extension, South Umbarka, Matruh, Northeast Abu Gharadig Extension and Khalda, waterflood projects and increased condensate from additional Qasr gas flowing through the new processing trains at the Salam Gas Plant. Australias production was up 1.5 Mb/d, as production was restored following completion of repairs at Varanus Island. North Sea production increased 1.5 Mb/d on strong drilling results, which offset the impact of unplanned downtime at the Bravo Platform, which lowered 2009 average daily oil production by 2.6 Mb/d. The Bravo Platform was down for most of the fourth quarter for pipeline repairs. Production declined 2.0 Mb/d in Canada, .9 Mb/d in Argentina and .7 Mb/d in the U.S., as natural decline offset results from our curtailed 2009 drilling programs. Natural Gas Revenues 2010 vs. 2009 Natural gas revenues for 2010 of $2.9 billion were $493 million higher than 2009 on a 12 percent increase in realized prices and a seven percent increase in production volumes. Realized prices in 2010 averaged $4.15 per Mcf and the $.46 per Mcf increase added $297 million to revenues. Worldwide production rose 130 MMcf/d, adding another $197 million to revenues. Worldwide gas production rose in all of our core gas producing regions. U.S. production was up 64.8 MMcf/d, or 10 percent. Driven by new drilling, recompletion activity and properties acquired from Devon and the Mariner 47 Table of Contents merger, Gulf Coast region production was up 38.2 MMcf/d. Permian region production was up 20.1 MMcf/d, primarily on volumes from properties acquired from BP. Central region production was up 6.5 MMcf/d as additional production from new drilling and recompletions outpaced natural decline. An active drilling and completion program at Horn River and additional volumes from properties acquired from BP led Canada region production 36.8 MMcf/d higher. Production in Australia was up 16.1 MMcf/d on higher customer takes from our John Brookes field. In Egypt, gross production was up 14 percent, while net production rose only three percent, a function of our production sharing contracts. The 12.2 MMcf/d increase in net production relative to 2009 was attributable to several factors, including a successful drilling and recompletion program on our Matruh concession, additional volumes processed through the Obaiyed Gas Plant and a full year of additional capacity provided by the completion of two new gas trains at the Salam Gas Plant. Argentinas production was up marginally as production from new drilling and recompletions was mostly offset by natural decline. 2009 vs. 2008 Natural gas accounted for 50 percent of our equivalent production and 28 percent of our oil and gas production revenues during 2009, compared to 50 and 32 percent, respectively, for 2008. Impacted by dramatically lower gas prices realized during the global financial crisis that began in late 2008, gas revenues for 2009 totaled $2.4 billion, down $1.6 billion from 2008. A 45 percent decline in average realized prices reduced revenues $1.8 billion, partially offset by the $184 million impact of a nine percent increase in production. Worldwide production grew 141 MMcf/d, driven by a 99 MMcf/d increase in Egypts net production and a 61 MMcf/d increase in Australia. Egypts gas production was up 38 percent on exploration successes at our Khalda and Matruh concessions and additional plant and pipeline capacity. Additional capacity provided by the combination of two new processing trains at the Salam Gas Plant and completion of a project to increase compression on the Northern Gas Pipeline allowed previously discovered wells in our Khalda Concession Qasr field to come online. Australias 49 percent production increase was driven by production restorations following completion of repairs to the Varanus Island facility. Canadas gas production increased 6 MMcf/d from drilling and recompletion activities and a lower effective royalty rate, partially offset by natural decline. Argentine production decreased 11 MMcf/d on natural decline and lower capital spending levels. U.S. daily production declined 14 MMcf/d. Production in the Gulf Coast decreased 8 MMcf/d as production shut in for facility, rig and third party downtime repairs reduced the 2009 production by 30 MMcf/d, which more than offset net production gains from drilling results. Our Central regions production declined 6 MMcf/d primarily a result of the regions curtailed drilling program, which was deferred until service costs fell in line with lower commodity prices. Most of the regions drilling activity occurred in the second half of the year. 48 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on relevance. Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) (Per boe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment Recurring $ 2,861 $ 2,202 $ 2,358 $ 11.92 $ 10.34 $ 12.06 Additional 2,818 5,334 13.24 27.27 Other assets 222 193 158 .92 .91 .81 Asset retirement obligation accretion 111 105 101 .46 .49 .52 Lease operating expenses 2,032 1,662 1,910 8.47 7.81 9.76 Gathering and transportation 178 143 157 .73 .67 .80 Taxes other than income 690 580 985 2.88 2.72 5.03 General and administrative expenses 380 344 289 1.58 1.62 1.48 Merger, acquisitions transition 183 .77 Financing costs, net 229 242 166 .95 1.13 .85 Total $ 6,886 $ 8,289 $ 11,458 $ 28.68 $ 38.93 $ 58.58 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization The following table details the changes in recurring depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) of oil and gas properties between 2010 and 2008: Recurring DDA (In millions) 2008 $ 2,358 Volume change 150 Rate change (306 ) 2009 $ 2,202 Volume change 317 Rate change 342 2010 $ 2,861 2010 vs. 2009 Recurring full cost depletion expense increased $659 million on an absolute dollar basis: $342 million on higher rate and $317 million from additional production. Our full cost depletion rate increased $1.58 to $11.92 per boe as costs to acquire, find and develop reserves exceeded our historical cost basis. 2009 vs. 2008 Recurring full cost depletion expense decreased $156 million on an absolute dollar basis: $306 million on lower rate, partially offset by an increase of $150 million from higher production. Our full cost depletion rate decreased $1.72 to $10.34 per boe. The decrease in rate was driven by a $5.33 billion non cash write down of the carrying value of our December 31, 2008, proved property balances in the U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canada and Argentina and a $2.82 billion non cash write down of the carrying value of our March 31, 2009, proved oil and gas property balances in the U.S. and Canada. The impact of the write downs was partially offset by 2009 drilling and finding costs, which exceeded our historical cost basis. 49 Table of Contents Lease Operating Expenses Lease operating expenses (LOE) include several components: direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as labor, boats, helicopters, materials and supplies. Oil, which contributed nearly half of our production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote plants and facilities. All production in Australia and the North Sea and nearly 90 percent from the U.S. Gulf Coast region comes from offshore properties. Workovers accelerate production; hence, activity generally increases with higher commodity prices. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations generally impact the Companys LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding to per unit costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar lowering per unit costs in our international regions. 2010 vs. 2009 Our 2010 LOE increased $370 million from 2009, or 22 percent on an absolute dollar basis. On a per unit basis, LOE increased eight percent with a 22 percent increase on higher costs, offset by a 14 percent decline related to increased production. The rate was impacted by the items below: Per boe 2009 LOE $ 7.81 Acquisitions, net of associated production .27 Foreign exchange rate impact .22 Equipment rental .22 Workover costs .16 Stock based compensation .14 Labor and pumper costs .08 Material .07 Power and fuel .07 Incentive compensation .05 Other .15 Other increased production (.77 ) 2010 LOE $ 8.47 2009 vs. 2008 Our 2009 LOE decreased $248 million from 2008. LOE per boe was down 20 percent: 13 percent on lower cost and seven percent on higher production. The rate was impacted by the items below: Per boe 2008 LOE $ 9.76 Higher production (.68 ) Workover costs (.36 ) Foreign exchange rate impact (.33 ) Power and fuel (.32 ) Labor and pumper costs (.10 ) Hurricane repairs (.10 ) Other (.06 ) 2009 LOE $ 7.81 50 Table of Contents Gathering and Transportation We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third party carrier and receive a price with no transportation deduction. In this case we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. In the U.S., Canada and Argentina, we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay transportation charges to a third party carrier. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs we paid directly to third party carriers for each of the periods presented: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) U.S. $ 42 $ 36 $ 40 Canada 75 53 63 North Sea 25 26 28 Egypt 31 23 21 Argentina 5 5 5 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 178 $ 143 $ 157 2010 vs. 2009 Gathering and transportation costs increased $35 million from 2009. The increase in the U.S. resulted from an increase in both the volumes transported under arrangements where we pay costs directly to third parties and in rates. The increase in Canada resulted from an increase in volumes, rate and foreign exchange rates. North Sea costs were down on lower production and foreign exchange rates. Egypt costs increased as a result of higher shipping, handling and pipeline fees as compared to the prior year. 2009 vs. 2008 Gathering and transportation costs decreased $14 million from 2008. The decreases in the U.S. and Canada resulted from a decrease in both the volumes transported under arrangements where we pay costs directly to third parties and in rates. North Sea costs were down on foreign exchange rates. Egypt costs increased as a result of retroactive terminal fees claimed by EGPC, partially offset by a decrease in export cargoes as more crude oil was purchased by EGPC for domestic use in the latter part of 2009. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes other than income primarily comprises U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters off the coast of the U.S. and Australia and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. and Canada. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties field in the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes including U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum Resources Rent tax and various Canadian taxes including: Freehold 51 Table of Contents Mineral tax, Saskatchewan Capital tax and Saskatchewan Resources surtax. We also pay taxes on invoices and bank transactions in Argentina. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) U.K. PRT $ 422 $ 383 $ 695 Severance taxes 142 88 168 Ad valorem taxes 80 55 71 Other taxes 46 54 51 Total Taxes other than income $ 690 $ 580 $ 985 2010 vs. 2009 Taxes other than income were $110 million higher than 2009. U.K. PRT was $39 million more than 2009 on a 10 percent increase in net profits driven by higher oil revenues. Severance taxes increased $54 million from higher taxable revenues in the U.S., predominantly resulting from acquisitions, and consistent with higher realized oil and natural gas prices relative to the prior year. The $25 million increase in ad valorem taxes resulted from higher taxable valuations in the U.S. associated with increases in oil and natural gas prices relative to the prior year and the BP and Devon acquisitions and Mariner merger. 2009 vs. 2008 Taxes other than income were $405 million lower than 2008. U.K. PRT was $312 million less than 2008 on a 43 percent decrease in net profits, driven by lower oil revenues and lower operating and capital costs. The decrease in severance taxes resulted from lower taxable revenues in the U.S., consistent with the lower realized oil and natural gas prices relative to the prior year. The $16 million decrease in ad valorem taxes resulted from lower taxable valuations associated with decreases in oil and natural gas prices. General and Administrative Expenses 2010 vs. 2009 General and administrative (GA) expenses were $36 million higher in 2010 than in 2009. On a per boe basis, GA expenses decreased two percent as the effect of higher volumes more than offset the increase in costs. GA expense was impacted by the following: 2009 GA $ 1.62 Workforce reduction costs (.19 ) Stock based compensation .15 Other incentive compensation .06 Kitimat LNG administrative costs .03 Other corporate costs .11 Increased production (.20 ) 2010 GA $ 1.58 2009 vs. 2008 GA expenses were $55 million higher in 2009 than in 2008. On a per boe basis, GA expenses increased nine percent: 19 percent on higher costs, offset by a 10 percent reduction on higher volumes. GA expense was impacted by the following: 2008 GA $ 1.48 Workforce reduction costs .20 Stock based compensation .17 Other incentive compensation (.06 ) Other corporate costs (.03 ) Increased production (.14 ) 2009 GA $ 1.62 52 Table of Contents Merger, Acquisitions Transition In 2010, the Company recognized $183 million in merger, acquisitions transition costs related to our BP and Devon acquisitions and the Mariner merger. A summary of these costs follows: Separation and retention costs $ 114 Investment banking fees 42 Other costs 27 2010 Merger, Acquisitions Transition $ 183 Merger, acquisitions transition costs during 2008 and 2009 were not material. Financing Costs, Net Financing costs incurred during the periods noted are composed of the following: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Interest expense $ 345 $ 309 $ 280 Amortization of deferred loan costs 17 6 4 Capitalized interest (120 ) (61 ) (94 ) Interest income (13 ) (12 ) (24 ) Total Financing costs, net $ 229 $ 242 $ 166 2010 vs. 2009 Financing costs, net decreased $13 million from 2009. The decrease is primarily related to a $59 million increase in capitalized interest, the result of additional unproved balances from the BP acquisitions and Mariner merger. This decrease is partially offset by a $36 million increase in interest expense from three debt issuances in 2010 and $11 million higher amortization of deferred loan costs related to the new debt and repayment of the Australian project financing facility. 2009 vs. 2008 Financing costs, net increased $76 million from 2008. The increase in cost is primarily the result of a $29 million increase in interest expense related to higher average outstanding debt balances, a $33 million reduction in capitalized interest related to lower unproved property balances and completion of several long term construction projects, and a $12 million decrease in interest income on a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes 2010 vs. 2009 The provision for income taxes totaled $2.2 billion in 2010 compared to $611 million in 2009. The effective rates for 2010 and 2009 were skewed by the effect of currency exchange rates on our foreign deferred tax liabilities and other net tax settlements. Total taxes and the effective rate for 2009 were also impacted by the magnitude of the taxes related to the full cost write down in that year. Excluding these items, the 2010 and 2009 effective tax rates were comparable at 40.75 percent and 39.75 percent, respectively. 2009 vs. 2008 The provision for income taxes totaled $611 million in 2009 compared to $220 million in 2008. Total taxes and the effective rates for each period were skewed by the magnitude of the taxes related to the 2009 and 2008 full cost write downs, the effect of currency exchange rates on our foreign deferred tax liabilities and other net tax settlements. Excluding these items, the 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates were comparable at 39.75 percent and 39.58 percent, respectively. Non GAAP Measures The Company makes reference to some measures in discussion of its financial and operating highlights that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these measures in assessing operating 53 Table of Contents results and believes the presentation of these measures provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations. These non GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used at other companies. Adjusted Earnings To assess the Companys operating trends and performance, management uses Adjusted Earnings, which is net income excluding certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Management believes this presentation may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts who adjust reported company earnings for items that may obscure underlying fundamentals and trends. The reconciling items below are the types of items management excludes and believes are frequently excluded by analysts when evaluating the operating trends and comparability of the Companys results. For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (In millions, except share data) Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stock (GAAP) $ 3,000 $ (292 ) Adjustments: Foreign currency fluctuation impact on deferred tax expense 52 198 Merger, acquisitions transition, net of tax(1) 120 Additional depletion, net of tax(2) 1,981 Adjusted Earnings (Non GAAP) $ 3,172 $ 1,887 Net Income (Loss) per Common Share Diluted (GAAP) $ 8.46 $ (0.87 ) Adjustments: Foreign currency fluctuation impact on deferred tax expense .15 .59 Merger, acquisitions transition, net of tax .33 Additional depletion, net of tax 5.87 Adjusted Earnings Per Share Diluted (Non GAAP) $ 8.94 $ 5.59 (1) Merger, acquisitions transition costs recorded in 2010 totaled $183 million pre tax, for which a tax benefit of $63 million was recognized. The tax effect was calculated utilizing the statutory rates in effect in each country where costs were incurred. (2) Additional depletion (non cash write down of the carrying value of proved property) recorded in 2009 was $2.82 billion pre tax, for which a deferred tax benefit of $837 million was recognized. The tax effect of the write down of the carrying value of proved property (additional depletion) in 2009 was calculated utilizing the statutory rates in effect in each country where a write down occurred. Acquisitions and Divestitures 2010 Activity In the fourth quarter of 2010 Apache acquired Mariner, an independent exploration and production company, in a stock and cash transaction totaling $2.7 billion. We also assumed approximately $1.7 billion of Mariners debt in connection with the merger. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, with Mariners assets and liabilities reflected in Apaches financial statements at fair value. Mariners oil and gas properties are primarily located in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater and shelf, the Permian Basin and onshore in the Gulf Coast. The Permian Basin and Gulf of Mexico shelf assets are complementary to Apaches existing holdings and provide an inventory of future potential drilling locations, particularly in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formation oil plays of the Permian Basin. Additionally, Mariner has accumulated acreage in emerging unconventional shale oil resources in the U.S. 54 Table of Contents In the third and fourth quarters of 2010 Apache completed the acquisition of BPs oil and gas operations, related infrastructure and acreage in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, substantially all of BPs Western Canadian upstream natural gas assets and BPs interests in four development licenses and one exploration concession (East Badr El Din) in the Western Desert of Egypt. The aggregate purchase price of the BP acquisitions, subsequent to exercise of preferential purchase rights, was $6.4 billion, subject to normal post closing adjustments. The effective date of these acquisitions was July 1, 2010. In the second quarter of 2010 Apache completed an acquisition of oil and gas assets on the Gulf of Mexico shelf from Devon for $1.05 billion, subject to normal post closing adjustments. The acquisition from Devon was effective January 1, 2010, and included 477,000 acres across 150 blocks. During the first quarter of 2010 Apache Canada, through its subsidiaries, closed the acquisition of a 51 percent interest in the Kitimat LNG facility and a 25.5 percent interest in a partnership that owns a related proposed pipeline. EOG Resources Canada owns the remaining 49 percent of the Kitimat LNG facility and a 24.5 percent interest in the pipeline partnership. In February 2011 Apache Canada and EOG Canada entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 50 percent interest in the partnership. Upon close of the transaction, Apache Canada and EOG Canada will own 51 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of the pipeline partnership and proposed pipeline. For further information regarding these acquisitions, please see Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. 2009 Activity During the second quarter of 2009 Apache announced the acquisition of nine Permian Basin oil and gas fields with then current net production of 3,500 boe/d from Marathon Oil Corporation for $187.4 million, subject to normal post closing adjustments. Estimated reserves acquired in connection with the acquisition totaled 19.5 MMboe. These long lived fields fit well with Apaches existing properties in the Permian Basin, particularly in Lea County, New Mexico, and will provide the Company many years of drilling opportunities. The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2009. 2008 Activity There was no major acquisition activity during 2008; however, the Company completed several divestiture transactions. On January 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359 on the outer continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to WT Offshore, Inc. for $116 million. On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas to Vanguard Permian, LLC for $78 million. On April 2, 2008, the Company completed the sale of non strategic Canadian properties to Central Global Resources for C$112 million. Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating cash flows is a primary source of liquidity. Apaches cash flows, both in the short term and the long term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices. Significant deterioration in commodity prices negatively impacts revenues, earnings and cash flows, capital spending and potentially our liquidity if spending does not trend downward as well. Sales volumes and costs also impact cash flows; however, these historically have not been as volatile or as impactive as commodity prices in the short term. Apaches long term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company and its reserves, a critical source of future liquidity, will shrink. Cash investments are required continuously to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions, which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of our exploration and development activities or our ability to acquire additional reserves at reasonable costs. For a discussion of risk factors related to our business and operations, please see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. 55 Table of Contents We may also elect to utilize available committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the occasional sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs. Apaches ability to access the debt and equity capital markets is supported by its investment grade credit ratings. We believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to Apache, combined with internally generated cash flows, will be adequate to fund short term and long term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Apaches primary uses of cash are exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs necessary to maintain ongoing operations, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. We fund our exploration and development activities primarily through operating cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected cash flows. See additional information, please see Part I, Items 1 and 2 Business and Properties and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. 56 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the years presented: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,726 $ 4,224 $ 7,065 Net commercial paper and bank loan borrowings 318 Sale of short term investments 792 Sales of property and equipment 2 308 Project financing draw downs 250 100 Fixed rate debt borrowings 2,470 796 Proceeds from issuance of common stock 2,258 Proceeds from issuance of depositary shares 1,227 Common stock activity 70 29 32 Treasury stock activity 9 6 4 Other 27 29 39 13,105 5,332 8,344 Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Capital expenditures(1) 4,922 3,631 5,823 Purchase of short term investments 792 Acquisitions: Devon properties 1,018 BP properties 6,429 Mariner 787 Other 126 310 150 Net commercial paper and bank loan repayments 2 200 Project financing repayment 350 Payments on fixed rate notes 1,023 100 Redemption of preferred stock 98 Dividends 226 209 239 Cost of debt and equity transactions 17 Other 121 115 85 15,019 4,465 7,289 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,914 ) $ 867 $ 1,055 (1) The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Operating cash flows is our primary source of capital and liquidity and is impacted, both in the short term and the long term, by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices. Apaches average natural gas price realizations fluctuated throughout 2010, dipping from a high of $4.84 per Mcf in February to a low of $3.89 in September before increasing to $4.19 in December. Average realized natural gas prices for the year rose 12 percent over 2009 to $4.15 per Mcf. Our average crude oil realizations saw an 57 Table of Contents increase throughout the year from a low of $70.68 per barrel in May 2010, peaking in December at $86.01 per barrel. Crude oil prices averaged $76.69 per barrel for 2010, up 28 percent from 2009. In order to manage the variability in cash flows, we utilize commodity hedges. At the end of 2010, we had hedged an average of just over 375,000 MMBtu per day of our 2011 North American natural gas production. The volumes were primarily hedged using fixed price swaps at an average price of approximately $6.25 per MMBtu. For perspective, the natural gas hedges represent 24 percent of fourth quarter 2010 North America daily gas production and 16 percent worldwide. For liquids, we had an average of just under 98,000 b/d of oil production hedged for 2011. Crude oil production was primarily hedged using collars that had average floor and ceiling prices of approximately $69 and $97 per barrel, respectively. In addition, 20,000 b/d of our North Sea Forties field production will be sold under a physical delivery contract subject to a minimum price of $70 a barrel and a ceiling price of $99 a barrel. For perspective, the combined 2011 financial derivatives represent approximately 35 percent of fourth quarter 2010 worldwide daily oil production. For additional information regarding our derivative contracts, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. For quantitative and qualitative information regarding our use of derivatives to manage commodity price risk, please see Commodity Risk in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10 K. The factors affecting operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non cash expenses such as DDA, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion and deferred income tax expense, which affect earnings but do not affect cash flows. For 2010, operating cash flows totaled $6.7 billion, up $2.5 billion from 2009. The primary driver of the increase was a $3.6 billion increase in oil and gas revenues on both higher production and prices, especially oil. This was partially offset by higher cash based expenses, including merger and transition expenses associated with our acquisitions in 2010, and higher income tax payments in 2010. For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, costs and expenses, please see Results of Operations in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non cash expenses which do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Commercial Paper and Bank Loans The Company has available a $2.95 billion commercial paper program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $913 million in commercial paper outstanding. For further discussion of our commercial paper program, please see Liquidity below and Note 5 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Upon consummation of our merger with Mariner, we assumed credit lines with outstanding borrowings of approximately $632 million. Commercial paper was issued to repay this amount, and credit lines assumed from Mariner were terminated prior to year end 2010. Short term Investments We occasionally invest in highly liquid, short term investments until funds are needed to further supplement our operating cash flows. At December 31, 2008, we had $792 million invested in U.S. Treasury securities with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year. These securities matured on April 2, 2009. None were held at December 31, 2010 or 2009. Project Financing One of the Companys Australian subsidiaries had a secured revolving syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments offshore Western Australia. The outstanding balance under the facility was 58 Table of Contents $350 million at December 31, 2009. We paid off $50 million of the facility in June 2010 and the remaining balance in December 2010. For a more detailed discussion of this facility and information regarding our available committed borrowing capacity, please see Liquidity below. Fixed Rate Debt On August 20, 2010, the Company issued $1.5 billion principal amount of senior unsecured 5.1 percent notes maturing September 1, 2040. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apaches option, subject to a make whole premium. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings under a bridge facility and the Companys commercial paper program that were used to finance the BP acquisitions. On December 3, 2010, the Company issued $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured 3.625 percent notes maturing February 1, 2021, and $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured 5.25 percent notes maturing February 1, 2042. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apaches option, subject to a make whole premium. The proceeds were used to redeem the outstanding public debt of $1.0 billion assumed upon completion of Apaches acquisition of Mariner on November 10, 2010. Proceeds from Issuance of Common Stock On July 28, 2010, in conjunction with Apaches $6.4 billion acquisition of properties from BP, the Company issued 26.45 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $88 per share. Proceeds, after underwriting discounts and before expenses, from the common stock offering totaled approximately $2.3 billion. Proceeds from Issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock On July 28, 2010, Apache issued 25.3 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Apaches 6.00 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D, with an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $50 liquidation preference per depositary share). The Company received proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, after underwriting discounts and before expenses, from the sale. Capital Expenditures We fund exploration and development activities primarily through operating cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected operating cash flows. Our operating cash flows, both in the short and long term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, operating cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to these adjusted operating cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs. Historically, we have used a combination of operating cash flows, borrowings under lines of credit and commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund significant acquisitions. 59 Table of Contents The following table details capital expenditures for each country in which we do business. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Exploration and Development: United States $ 1,623 $ 929 $ 2,183 Canada 860 412 705 North America 2,483 1,341 2,888 Egypt 757 676 853 Australia 624 602 880 North Sea 617 375 459 Argentina 240 140 318 Chile 20 11 27 International 2,258 1,804 2,537 Worldwide Exploration and Development Costs 4,741 3,145 5,425 Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities (GTP): Canada 159 83 29 Egypt 182 151 571 Australia 162 69 54 Argentina 3 2 5 Total GTP Costs 506 305 659 Asset Retirement Costs 459 288 514 Capitalized Interest 120 61 94 Capital Expenditures, excluding Acquisitions 5,826 3,799 6,692 Acquisitions, including GTP 11,557 310 150 Asset Retirement Costs Acquired 847 5 Total Capital Expenditures $ 18,230 $ 4,114 $ 6,842 Exploration and Development As a result of Apaches determination to not outspend our operating cash flows, we curtailed 2009 capital expenditures in response to the decline in commodity prices and financial uncertainty in the global economy at the outset of 2009. Our 2010 drilling and development budgets were increased in response to recovering commodity prices and projected increases in operating cash flows. As a result, worldwide ED expenditures for 2010 were 51 percent higher than 2009. ED spending in North America, which was up 85 percent from the prior year, totaled 52 percent of worldwide ED spending, up from 43 percent in 2009. U.S. ED expenditures were $694 million or 75 percent higher than year ago levels on expanded drilling activities in the Permian region and horizontal drilling in the Granite Wash play in the Central region. Activity related to newly acquired properties in the Permian and Gulf Coast regions also contributed to increased ED expenditures late in the year. ED spending in Canada more than doubled, increasing to $860 million as the Company actively developed and increased its acreage positions in several plays including the Horn River basin. ED expenditures outside of North America increased 25 percent over 2009 to nearly $2.3 billion. ED spending in the North Sea was up $242 million over 2009 levels on construction of the Bacchus subsea tie back project and on the Forties Alpha satellite platform and ongoing upgrades to existing platforms. Argentina expenditures were up on additional drilling and development activity. Egypt was $81 million higher than the prior year on continued drilling activity in the Matruh and Faghur basins, where we have announced numerous recent discoveries. ED expenditures in Australia and Chile were up marginally, increasing over prior year levels by $22 million and $9 million, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Acquisitions We completed over $11 billion of acquisitions in 2010 compared to $310 million in 2009. We also assumed $847 million in asset retirement costs. Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive opportunities arise and, therefore, vary from year to year. For information regarding our acquisitions, please see Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures above and Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Asset Retirement Costs In 2010 we recorded $459 million of additional future asset retirement costs associated with our worldwide drilling programs and upward revisions to prior year estimates for timing and costs. Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities (GTP) We invested $506 million in GTP in 2010 compared to $305 million in 2009. GTP expenditures in Australia consisted of construction activity at the Devil Creek Gas Plant and the FEED study for the Wheatstone LNG project. Activity in Canada was centered in the Horn River basin, with expenditures for compressor stations, a water treatment facility, gathering systems and a gas processing plant. Expenditures in Egypt included the initial phases of the Kalabsha oil processing facility. In addition, approximately $517 million of the value of our 2010 acquisitions is associated with GTP. Dividends The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 46 consecutive years through 2010. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. Common stock dividends paid during 2010 totaled $206 million, compared with $201 million in 2009 and $234 million in 2008. The 2008 period included a special non recurring cash dividend of 10 cents per common share paid on March 18, 2008. The Company also made dividend payments of $20 million on the Companys Series D Preferred Stock in 2010. Liquidity At December 31, (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 134 $ 2,048 Total debt 8,141 5,067 Shareholders equity 24,377 15,779 Available committed borrowing capacity 2,387 2,300 Floating rate debt/total debt 12 % 7 % Percent of total debt to capitalization 25 % 24 % Our liquidity and financial position have not been materially affected by the increase of our total debt compared to prior year levels nor recent uncertainty in the credit markets. The increase in total debt was associated with current year acquisitions of cash generating oil and gas properties that were supplemented by equity issuances and resulted in an increase in debt to capitalization ratios of less than one percent. We believe that losses from non performance are unlikely to occur; however, we are not able to predict sudden changes in the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Twenty seven of 28 banks with lending commitments to the Company have credit ratings of at least single A, which in some cases is based on government support. There is no assurance that the financial condition of these banks will not deteriorate or that the government guarantee will be maintained. We closely monitor the ratings of the 28 banks in our bank group. Having a large bank group allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any banks failure to honor its lending commitment. Cash and Cash Equivalents We had $134 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, $120 million of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries and approximately $14 million was held by Apache Corporation and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. Almost all of the cash is denominated in U.S. dollars and, at times, is invested in highly liquid, investment grade securities, with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We intend to use cash from our international subsidiaries to fund international projects. 61 Table of Contents Debt At December 31, 2010, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes, debentures, commercial paper and uncommitted bank lines, totaled $8.1 billion. Current debt consists of $46 million borrowed under uncommitted money market/overdraft lines of credit in the U.S. and Argentina. We have $46 million of debt maturing in 2011, $400 million maturing in 2012, $1.8 billion maturing in 2013, $350 million maturing in 2015, and the remaining $5.6 billion maturing intermittently in years 2016 through 2096. Debt to Capitalization Ratio The Companys debt to capitalization ratio as of December 31, 2010 was 25 percent. Available Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2010, the Company had unsecured committed revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling $3.3 billion, of which $1.0 billion matures in August 2011 and $2.3 billion matures in May 2013. The facilities consist of a $1.0 billion 364 day facility, a $1.5 billion facility and a $450 million facility in the U.S., a $200 million facility in Australia and a $150 million facility in Canada. The $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities also allow the company to borrow under competitive auctions. The U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apaches commercial paper program. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S. and Canada of up to five percent of the Companys consolidated assets, or approximately $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2010. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group. There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2010. At the Companys option, the interest rate for the facilities, excluding the 364 day facility, is based on a base rate, as defined, or LIBOR plus a margin determined by the Companys senior long term debt rating. In the case of the 364 day facility, the margin over LIBOR varies based upon prices reported in the credit default swap market with respect to Apaches one year indebtedness and the rating for Apaches senior, unsecured long term debt. In 2010, one of the Companys Australian subsidiaries repaid $350 million under its amortizing secured revolving syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments offshore Western Australia. Upon repayment of the facility, all commitments under the facility were terminated and assets secured by the facility were released. At December 31, 2010, the margin over LIBOR for committed loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and .23 percent on the $450 million facility in the U.S., the $200 million facility in Australia and the $150 million facility in Canada. If the total amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion facility and 62 Table of Contents .07 percent on the total amount of the other three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the Companys senior long term debt rating. Commercial Paper Program In August 2010 the Company increased its commercial paper program by $1 billion from $1.95 billion to $2.95 billion. The commercial paper program generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. Our 2010 weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was .37 percent. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. credit facilities are available as a 100 percent backstop. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under U.S. committed credit facilities, which expire in 2011 and 2013. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $913 million in commercial paper outstanding. Contractual Obligations We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. These contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 5 Debt and Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K.

(d) This table does not include the Companys tax reserves. For additional information regarding tax reserves, please see Note 6 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. 63 Table of Contents Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $135 million for environmental remediation and approximately $14 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. The Company also had approximately $106 million accrued as of December 31, 2010, for an insurance contingency as a member of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). This insurance co op insures specific property, pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay a withdrawal premium if we elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential withdrawal premium is calculated annually based on past losses and the nature of our asset base. The liability reflecting this potential charge has been fully accrued. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions. Insurance Program We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our oil and gas properties, third party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, general liability, sudden pollution and other coverage. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. In general, our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our oil and gas assets provide $250 million per occurrence with an additional $250 million per year. Coverage for damage to our U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets specifically resulting from a named windstorm, however, is subject to a maximum of $250 million per named windstorm, includes a self insured retention of 40 percent of the losses above a $100 million deductible, and is limited to no more than two storms per year. In addition, our policies covering physical damage to our North Sea oil and gas assets provide $250 million per occurrence with an additional $750 million per year. Our various insurance policies also provide coverage for, among other things, liability related to negative environmental impacts of a sudden pollution event in the amount of $750 million per occurrence, charterers legal liability, in the amount of $1 billion per occurrence, aircraft liability in the amount of $750 million per occurrence, and general liability, employers liability and auto liability in the amount of $500 million per occurrence. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service providers employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider. Our insurance policies generally renew in January and June of each year. In light of the recent catastrophic accident in the Gulf of Mexico, we may not be able to secure similar coverage for the same costs. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. Apache purchases multi year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and highly rated international insurers covering its investments in Egypt. In the aggregate, these policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $1 billion of coverage to Apache covering losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks and currency inconvertibility. In addition, the Company has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $300 million of coverage for losses arising from (1) non payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of 64 Table of Contents exportable petroleum when actions taken by the Government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apaches financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of Apaches most critical accounting policies: Reserves Estimates Effective December 31, 2009, Apache adopted revised oil and gas disclosure requirements set forth by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Release No. 33 8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting and as codified by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas. The new rules include changes to the pricing used to estimate reserves, the option to disclose probable and possible reserves, revised definitions for proved reserves, additional disclosures with respect to undeveloped reserves, and other new or revised definitions and disclosures. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DDA expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. Reserves as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Reserves as of December 31, 2008 were estimated using prices in effect at the end of that year, in accordance with SEC guidance in effect prior to the issuance of the Modernization Rules. Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing. Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal 65 Table of Contents technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. ARO associated with retiring tangible long lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with Apaches oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. Income Taxes Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions meet certain legislative, judicial and regulatory requirements. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired companys assets and liabilities and tax related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed we made various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in Reserve Estimates. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. 66 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates, foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Commodity Risk The Companys revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile due to unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather and climate. Our average monthly crude oil realizations saw a gradual increase from a low of $70.68 per barrel in May 2010, peaking in December at $86.10. In 2010 crude oil prices averaged $76.69 per barrel up 28 percent from 2009. Our average monthly natural gas price realizations fluctuated throughout 2010, dipping from a high of $4.84 per Mcf in February to a low of $3.89 in September before increasing to $4.19 in December. Average realized prices in 2010 for natural gas increased 12 percent to $4.15 per Mcf. For 2010 approximately 23 percent of our natural gas production was subject to financial derivative hedges. As of year end 2010 we had just over 375,000 MMBtu per day of our projected 2011 North American natural gas production hedged. For perspective, these hedges cover 24 percent of fourth quarter 2010 North American daily production, or 16 percent of worldwide production. Approximately 12 percent of our 2010 crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges. We entered 2011 having hedged approximately 98,000 b/d of oil production. In addition, Apache North Sea, Ltd. entered into a 2011 physical sales contract to deliver 20 thousand barrels of oil per day under a collar pricing arrangement. For perspective, the combined 2011financial derivatives represent approximately 35 percent of our fourth quarter 2010 worldwide daily oil volumes. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. On December 31, 2010, the Company had open natural gas derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of $454 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately $104 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately $104 million. The Company also had open crude oil derivatives in a liability position with a fair value of $466 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would increase the liability by approximately $356 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would decrease the liability by approximately $298 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2010. For notional volumes and terms associated with the Companys derivative contracts, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy. The Risk Management Committee approves and oversees these controls, which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit, limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Interest Rate Risk On December 31, 2010, the Companys debt with fixed interest rates represented approximately 88 percent of total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately 12 percent of Apaches debt will fluctuate based on 67 Table of Contents short term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating interest rates on year end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately $782,000. Foreign Currency Risk The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and gas production is sold largely under fixed price Australian dollar contracts. Approximately half the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in U.S. dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars but converted into Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds and Argentine pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of Other under Revenues and Other or, as is the case when we re measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Companys provision for income tax expense on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. A 10 percent strengthening or weakening of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Egyptian pound or Argentine peso as of December 31, 2010, would result in a foreign currency net loss or gain, respectively, of approximately $16 million.
