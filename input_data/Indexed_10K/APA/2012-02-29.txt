ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. We currently have exploration and production interests in six countries: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, Australia, offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea, and Argentina. Apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K, and the Risk Factors information set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Executive Overview Strategy Apaches mission is to grow a profitable global exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long term benefit of our shareholders. Apaches long term perspective has many dimensions, which are centered on the following core strategic components: balanced portfolio of core assets conservative capital structure rate of return focus A cornerstone of our strategy is balancing our portfolio through diversity of geologic risk, geographic risk, hydrocarbon mix (crude oil versus natural gas), and reserve life in order to achieve consistency in results. Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our balanced portfolio approach. Our 2011 results reflected the benefit of our product balance, as crude oil and liquids combined represented 50 percent of our production but provided 79 percent of our $16.8 billion of oil and gas revenues. Crude oil drove 92 percent of this combined crude and liquids production and 96 percent of the related revenues. International Dated Brent crudes and sweet crude from the Gulf Coast continue to be priced at a significant premium to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) based prices. As a result of our geographic balance, we are receiving these premium prices on approximately 76 percent of our crude oil production. The advantage of our geographic balance is also reflected in our 2011 natural gas revenues. Over one third of our natural gas is produced outside of North America, where 2011 prices averaged 27 percent higher than 2010. This balance allowed us to achieve record earnings and cash flow from operations for the year. Preserving financial flexibility is also important to our overall business philosophy. We believe our balance sheet, and the financial flexibility it provides, is one of our most important strategic assets. It is also key in positioning us to pursue value creating acquisitions when opportunities arise. During 2011, we reduced debt to $7.2 billion and ended the year with a debt to capitalization ratio of 20 percent, down from 25 percent at the end of 2010, despite current year capital investments of $8 billion and cash payments on acquisitions totaling nearly $2 billion. In addition, we have $3.3 billion of available committed borrowing capacity that provides additional flexibility to our business. Our balance sheet strength, financial flexibility, and record levels of cash flow from operations provide a solid foundation as we continue to integrate recent acquisitions and monetize opportunities in all of our regions. Each of our operating regions has a significant producing asset base as well as large undeveloped acreage positions, which provide room for growth through sustainable lower risk drilling opportunities, balanced by higher risk, higher reward exploration. We closely monitor drilling and acquisition cost trends in each of our 38 Table of Contents core areas relative to product prices and, when appropriate, adjust our budgets accordingly. We review capital allocations at least quarterly. We do this through a disciplined and focused process that includes analyzing current economic conditions, projected rate of return on internally generated drilling prospects, opportunities for tactical acquisitions, land positions with additional drilling prospects, or, occasionally, new core areas that could enhance our portfolio. In addition, we actively seek to identify and pursue ways to maintain efficient levels of costs and expenses. Our overall approach to managing cash expenditures has enabled us to consistently deliver strong results with 2011 return on average capital employed and return on equity of 13 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategic principles have underpinned our ability to deliver production, reserve growth, and competitive returns on invested capital for the benefit of our shareholders. Delivering successful results under this strategy is bolstered by Apaches unique culture. A strong sense of urgency, empowerment of our employees, effective incentive systems, and an independent mindset are at the heart of how we build value. Financial and Operating Results Apaches steady commitment to our core strategies drove financial performance throughout 2011. For the 12 month period ending December 31, 2011, Apache reported record performances in several key metrics. Highlights for the year include: Annual daily production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids averaged a record 748 Mboe/d, up 14 percent compared with 2010. Production in fourth quarter 2011 averaged 759 Mboe/d, an increase of four percent from the 729 Mboe/d averaged in the fourth quarter of 2010. Oil and gas production revenues for 2011 increased 38 percent to $16.8 billion, up from $12.2 billion in 2010, well above our prior record of $12.3 billion achieved in 2008, when we also saw record prices. Apache reported a record $4.5 billion in income attributable to common stock, an increase of over 50 percent compared to $3 billion in 2010. Net income per diluted common share was $11.47 in 2011, up from $8.46 in 2010. Apaches reported adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items impacting the comparability of results, were $4.7 billion in 2011, an increase of 47 percent from $3.2 billion in 2010. Adjusted earnings per common diluted share were $11.83 in 2011, up from $8.94 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings is not a financial measure prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). For a description of adjusted earnings and a reconciliation of adjusted earnings to income attributable to common stock, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see Non GAAP Measures in this Item 7. Net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows or cash flows) totaled $10.0 billion, up 48 percent from $6.7 billion in 2010. 2012 Outlook As we head into 2012, we believe our inventory of exploration and development projects offers numerous growth opportunities. Recent drilling successes and continued acquisition of acreage positions in all of our operating regions has built a robust drilling inventory for the Company. Coupled with large scale development projects currently in progress, our global allocation of capital is critical. Given the present price disparity between oil and natural gas, our near term focus is exploiting the oil prone and more liquids rich properties in our portfolio. Our plan for 2012 also includes development of our gas resources in Australia and Canada to supply our LNG projects, which, if completed, would enable us to monetize these resources at prices more closely linked to crude oil. Rate of return will drive our decision making while we continue our focus on costs, operational efficiency, and integrating recently acquired assets. 39 Table of Contents Our current 2012 capital budget is approximately $9.5 billion. Nearly $5.3 billion is expected to be spent on projects in North America, with the remaining amount allocated across our international regions. While funds have been committed for certain 2012 exploration drilling, long lead development projects, and front end engineering and design (FEED) studies, the majority of our drilling and development projects are discretionary and subject to acceleration, deferral, or cancellation as conditions warrant. We closely monitor commodity prices, service cost levels, regulatory impacts, and numerous other industry factors, and we typically review and revise our exploration and development budgets based on changes to predicted operating cash flows on a quarterly basis. Apache projects an increase in 2012 production between 7 percent and 13 percent from full year 2011 production levels, after adjusting for 2011 divestitures. We generally do not budget for acquisitions because they are specific, discrete events whose occurrence and timing is unpredictable. Acquisitions may be funded from operating cash flows, credit facilities, new equity, debt issuances, or a combination thereof. Operating Highlights Apache pursues opportunities for growth through exploration, exploitation, and development drilling, supplemented by strategic acquisitions. In 2011, we generated $10 billion of cash flow from operations, which enabled us to deliver on a robust capital budget, investing approximately $8 billion in capital expenditures across all of our regions while paying down nearly $1 billion in debt. We have also been significantly active in the acquisition market for the past two years, having identified several opportunities that met our criteria for risk, reward, rate of return, and growth potential. Merger and Acquisitions of Property and Acreage During 2011 and 2010, we completed nearly $14 billion in acquisitions culminating in the purchase of Exxon Mobil Corporations North Sea subsidiary, Mobil North Sea Limited. As we head into 2012, Apache continues to be active with recent acquisition announcements in Australia and the Anadarko basin of the central U.S. Each of our acquisitions fits well with our long term strategy of maintaining a balanced portfolio of core assets by adding high quality properties with a diversity of geologic and geographic risk, product mix, and reserve life. The properties acquired impacted nine of our ten operating regions and are strategically positioned to benefit from our existing infrastructure and operating experience. For detailed information regarding our recent acquisitions, please see Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures in this Item 7 and Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. 2012 Acquisitions Australian Burrup Holdings Limited acquisition On January 31, 2012, a subsidiary of Apache Energy Limited completed the acquisition of a 49 percent interest in Burrup Holdings Limited (BHL) for $439 million, including working capital adjustments. BHL is the owner of an ammonia fertilizer plant on the Burrup Peninsula of Western Australia. Central Anadarko basin acquisition Apache announced in January 2012 that we agreed to acquire Cordillera Energy Partners III, LLC (Cordillera), a privately held company, for approximately 6.3 million shares of Apache common stock and $2.2 billion in cash. The merger is expected to close during the second quarter of 2012. 2011 Acquisitions North Sea acquisition On December 30, 2011, Apache completed the acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited from Exxon Mobil Corporation with cash consideration of $1.25 billion. 40 Table of Contents 2010 Acquisitions Gulf of Mexico Shelf acquisition On June 9, 2010, Apache completed the acquisition of oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) shelf from Devon Energy Corporation (Devon) for $1.05 billion. Mariner merger On November 10, 2010, Apache completed the acquisition of Mariner Energy, Inc. (Mariner) for stock and cash consideration totaling $2.7 billion. We also assumed approximately $1.7 billion of Mariners debt with the merger. Permian acquisition On August 10, 2010, we completed the acquisition of BP plcs (BP) oil and gas operations, acreage, and infrastructure in the Permian Basin for $2.5 billion, net of preferential rights to purchase. Canadian acquisition On October 8, 2010, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of BPs upstream natural gas business in western Alberta and British Columbia for $3.25 billion. Egyptian acquisition On November 4, 2010, we completed the acquisition of BPs assets in Egypts Western Desert for $650 million. Exploration, Exploitation and Development Activities Our internally generated exploration and drilling opportunities, multi year development projects, and recent acquisitions provide the foundation for our growth in the near and long term. Highlights of our 2011 drilling successes, exploration discoveries, LNG project milestones, and other opportunities for continued growth include: International Activities North Sea Drilling and Exploitation New 4 D seismic interpretation derived from the latest 3 D seismic survey acquired over the Forties field in 2010 highlighted areas of bypassed oil. During 2011, we drilled 14 wells, of which 11 were productive. The Charlie 4 3 well commenced production in June at a rate of 12,567 b/d, and the Charlie 2 2 well was completed in March with an initial rate of 11,876 b/d. These wells represent some of the highest rates in the Forties field since the early 1990s. North Sea Satellite Platform Project Construction of the Forties Alpha Satellite Platform is underway and is projected to be complete by the third quarter of 2012. This platform will sit adjacent to the main Alpha platform and will provide Apache with 18 new slots for drilling additional development wells to increase the ultimate recovery from the Forties field. The satellite platform will also expand critical utility services to the field, including power generation, produced fluid processing, high pressure gas compression for artificial lift and dehydration. Egypt Discoveries Apaches Egyptian operations continue to expand further into the Western Desert and achieved a record for annual production in 2011. We maintained an active drilling and development program throughout 2011, drilling 221 exploration, development, and injector wells, resulting in 33 new field discoveries. Most notably, we drilled the first Paleozoic discovery at Tayim West, which test flowed at 3,600 b/d. This Paleozoic discovery opens a new play deeper than previous discoveries in the Western Desert and provides for continued exploration opportunities. We also made our first discovery in the Siwa Concession, our western most concession in Egypt, with the Siwa D 1X well that flowed at 4,490 b/d and 8 MMcf/d. In addition to increased drilling activity, we continue to assess opportunities to leverage existing processing and transportation infrastructure at the BP acquired Abu Gharadig field complex and expand our processing facilities in the Faghur and Matruh basins. 41 Table of Contents Argentina Exploration Apaches first horizontal well in the Anticlinal Campamento field in the Neuqu&eacute;n basin began producing at a rate over 10 MMcf/d. The well was a test of horizontal drilling and multi stage hydraulic fracturing in the low permeability Pre Cuyo formation. Apache continues to evaluate the potential of tight and unconventional gas resources in the Pre Cuyo, Los Molles, and Vaca Muerta formations of the Neuqu&eacute;n basin, which is supported by higher gas prices realized under the Gas Plus program. In 2011, the average Gas Plus volume sold by Apache was 55.1 MMcf/d at an average price of $4.89 per Mcf. Australia Exploration Ongoing exploration activity at the Julimar and Brunello complex resulted in the discovery of a deeper Mungaroo gas formation encountering 362 feet of net pay. This 65 percent working interest Balnaves Deep well is associated with continuing field development efforts and augments previous discoveries. Separately, the Zola 1 natural gas discovery logged 410 feet of net pay and is on trend with the Gorgon gas field 16 miles to the north and near both existing and developing infrastructure. The evaluation of the 30 percent working interest discovery, including the planning of future appraisal drilling, is underway. Australia Reindeer Field Development and Devil Creek Gas Plant Development of our Reindeer gas field and construction of the Devil Creek Gas Plant was completed in December 2011. Gas production from the Reindeer development has been sold to a number of customers in Western Australias growing mining and minerals processing sectors at prices significantly higher than current realizations. Apache owns a 55 percent interest in the field and is the operator. Australia Halyard Field Development Initial production from our Halyard 1 discovery well commenced in June 2011 upon completion of the tie in to the existing gas facilities on Varanus Island. The Halyard development was completed ahead of schedule and set the stage for further development of our nearby Spar field. The 2010 Spar 2 discovery is projected to commence production in 2013 through an extension of the Halyard subsea infrastructure that will also allow for the tie in of future wells. Australia Macedon Field Development First production is also projected in 2013 from four completed gas wells in the Macedon gas field. We have a 29 percent non operating working interest in the field. Gas will be delivered via a 60 mile pipeline to a 200 MMcf/d gas plant to be built at Ashburton North in Western Australia. The project, approved in 2010, is currently underway. Australia Coniston Oil Field Development The Coniston field is an oil accumulation near our Van Gogh field in Australia. The project was sanctioned for development in 2011 with first production projected in 2013. Apache operates the field with a 52.5 percent working interest and expects peak production to be approximately 30 Mb/d. The field will be produced via subsea completions tied back to the Ningaloo Vision floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) that services Apaches Van Gogh oil field. To more effectively control the Van Gogh and Coniston field operations, development, and maintenance efforts, this FPSO (the Ningaloo Vision) was purchased from the previous lessor in January 2012 for $185 million, $97 million net to Apache. Australia Balnaves Oil Development In 2011, the Company announced that it will proceed with development of the offshore Balnaves field, an oil accumulation located in a separate reservoir within the large gas reservoirs of our Brunello gas fields. The project is expected to deliver initial gross production of 30 Mb/d in 2014 through a leased FPSO. Apache has a 65 percent working interest in the operated project. Australia Wheatstone LNG Project During 2011, the Company and its partners announced they will proceed with the Chevron operated Wheatstone LNG development project (Wheatstone) in Western Australia. The first phase of the Wheatstone project will comprise two LNG processing trains with a combined capacity of approximately 8.9 million metric tons per annum (mtpa), a domestic gas plant, and associated infrastructure. Apache has a 13 percent interest in the project and expects to invest approximately $4 billion over five years for the field and LNG facility development. Apache will supply gas to Wheatstone from its operated Julimar and Brunello complex, which was approved for development by the Australian government in September 2011. The 65 percent interest Julimar development project is expected to generate average net sales to Apache of 42 Table of Contents approximately 140 MMcf/d of gas (equivalent to 1.07 million mtpa of LNG) at prices pegged to world oil markets, 22 MMcf/d of sales gas into the domestic market, and 3,250 barrels of condensate per day. First production is projected for 2016. North America Activities Permian Basin Gas Plant Development During 2011, Apache agreed with Crosstex Energy, L.P. to jointly build an $85 million natural gas processing facility for our Deadwood development in the Permian Basin of west Texas. The plant, in which Apache has a 50 percent interest, is anticipated to become fully operational in the second quarter of 2012, with capacity of 50 MMcf/d. This infrastructure will enable Apache to continue its active development program targeting multiple stacked formations, including the Wolfcamp, Cline, Strawn, Atoka, and Fusselman. North America Horizontal Drilling Apache continues to evaluate horizontal drilling potential across our acreage positions, in both conventional and unconventional reservoirs. In the Permian Basin, Apache is utilizing horizontal drilling to access bypassed, unswept oil zones in established waterfloods. The identification and development of significant resources in shale formations and other unconventional gas plays has also been the focus of drilling opportunities during 2011. Natural gas production growth in North America will likely be driven by our activity in three large unconventional plays: shale gas in British Columbias Horn River basin, tight sands in British Columbias Noel area, and the liquids rich Granite Wash tight sands in the Anadarko basin of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Kitimat LNG Project The time horizon and magnitude of Apaches shale gas development will be impacted by North American gas prices and investment decisions surrounding our ownership in the Kitimat LNG facility and a related proposed pipeline. The project has the potential to open new markets linked to oil prices in the Asia Pacific region for gas from Apaches Canadian operations. In October 2011, Apache and its partners in the Kitimat LNG project announced that the National Energy Board granted the project a 20 year export license to ship LNG from Canada to international markets. This export approval represents a major milestone for Kitimat LNG and its partners. In addition, the Company progressed with the FEED study and continued efforts to secure firm sales commitments and required permits necessary to make a final investment decision on the LNG project. Alaska Cook Inlet Acreage During 2011, Apache continued to accumulate acreage in Alaskas Cook Inlet and was the successful bidder on approximately 515,000 acres of onshore and offshore state leases. The Company has now accumulated approximately 800,000 gross acres in the Cook Inlet. We have current plans to conduct a seismic survey for the area and drill a well within the next 12 months. Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Exploration Apaches strategic presence in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater portfolio was gained through the 2010 merger with Mariner Energy, Inc. At the end of 2011, the Company held approximately 750,000 gross acres across 148 blocks. The Bushwood, Wide Berth, and Mandy development projects are expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2012, with combined net initial production of 12 Mboe/d. In addition, the larger scale non operated Lucius project was sanctioned in the fourth quarter of 2011. Apache has an 11.7 percent working interest in this development, with first production projected for 2014. We also plan to increase our exploration activity in 2012, having recently been awarded four deepwater exploration plans. We expect to drill or participate in drilling nine wells during 2012 compared with two wells drilled in the current year. Significant Events Egypt Political Unrest In February 2011, former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped down, and the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took power. In November 2011, Egypt held its first round of parliamentary elections. Despite the Muslim Brotherhoods Freedom and Justice Partys victory in the parliamentary elections, 43 Table of Contents Egypt remains under martial law. Although Egypts first post revolutionary parliament convened on January 23, 2012, the new Parliament remains subordinate to the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has stated its intention to turn over power to civilians following the presidential election expected in June 2012. Apaches operations, located in remote locations in the Western Desert, have continued uninterrupted, and we currently plan to invest $1 billion in Egypt in 2012. Our operations in Egypt contributed 22 percent of our 2011 production and accounted for 10 percent of our year end estimated proved reserves. At year end 2011, 17 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows and 7.5 percent of our net capitalized oil and gas property was attributable to Egypt. For further information regarding our Egypt region, please see Note 13 Business Segment Information and Note 14 Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Apache purchases multi year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and other highly rated international insurers covering its investments in Egypt. In the aggregate, these policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $1 billion of coverage to Apache for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks, with a $237.5 million sub limit for currency inconvertibility. In addition, the Company has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $225 million of coverage, including a self insured retention of $37.5 million, for losses arising from (1) non payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum when actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. A deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Potential Pipeline Capacity Constraints on North Sea Production On April 8, 2011, BP Exploration Operating Company Limited (BP Exploration) sent a letter to Apache North Sea Limited alleging the potential for capacity constraints or increased tariffs relating to the Shippers Pipeline Liquids Transportation and Processing Agreement, dated January 11, 2003, between BP Exploration and Apache North Sea Limited. Apache North Sea Limited disagrees with the characterizations in the letter and will contest them vigorously. However, because this matter is unresolved, resolution of this matter, through litigation or otherwise, and or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contract with BP Exploration could, in the future, adversely affect our production and revenues from the Forties Field in the North Sea. Argentina Tax and Royalty Claims ENARGAS, an autonomous entity that functions under the Argentina Ministry of Economy, has issued administrative orders creating a tariff charge on all fuel gas used by oil and gas producers in field operations effective December 1, 2011. The tariff charge is applicable to the operations of Company affiliates in Argentina and could cost approximately $21 million annually. In addition, in late 2010 and early 2011, the Province of Tierra del Fuego notified Company affiliates of its claims for additional royalty on natural gas, crude oil, and liquefied petroleum gas. The Companys affiliates have initiated legal proceedings challenging both ENARGAS tariff charge and the Provinces claims for additional royalty. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations Oil and Gas Revenues For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 $ Value %Contribution $ Value %Contribution $ Value %Contribution (In millions) (In millions) (In millions) Oil Revenues: United States $ 4,163 33% $ 2,683 30% $ 1,922 32% Canada 485 4% 388 4% 311 5% North America 4,648 37% 3,071 34% 2,233 37% Egypt 4,169 33% 2,875 32% 2,063 34% Australia 1,552 12% 1,296 14% 230 4% North Sea 2,072 16% 1,590 18% 1,356 22% Argentina 238 2% 209 2% 207 3% International 8,031 63% 5,970 66% 3,856 63% Total (1) $ 12,679 100% $ 9,041 100% $ 6,089 100% Natural Gas Revenues: United States $ 1,550 43% $ 1,409 49% $ 1,054 44% Canada 1,033 29% 647 23% 546 23% North America 2,583 72% 2,056 72% 1,600 67% Egypt 621 17% 495 17% 490 21% Australia 182 5% 163 6% 133 6% North Sea 19 0% 16 0% 13 0% Argentina 204 6% 132 5% 133 6% International 1,026 28% 806 28% 769 33% Total (2) $ 3,609 100% $ 2,862 100% $ 2,369 100% Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Revenues: United States $ 391 75% $ 208 74% $ 74 64% Canada 99 19% 39 14% 20 17% North America 490 94% 247 88% 94 81% Egypt 1 0% 2 1% 0% Argentina 31 6% 31 11% 22 19% International 32 6% 33 12% 22 19% Total $ 522 100% $ 280 100% $ 116 100% Total Oil and Gas Revenues: United States $ 6,104 36% $ 4,300 35% $ 3,050 36% Canada 1,617 10% 1,074 9% 877 10% North America 7,721 46% 5,374 44% 3,927 46% Egypt 4,791 29% 3,372 28% 2,553 30% Australia 1,734 10% 1,459 12% 363 4% North Sea 2,091 12% 1,606 13% 1,369 16% Argentina 473 3% 372 3% 362 4% International 9,089 54% 6,809 56% 4,647 54% Total $ 16,810 100% $ 12,183 100% $ 8,574 100% (1) Financial derivative hedging activities and the North Sea fixed price sales contract decreased 2011 and 2010 oil revenues by $379 million and $57 million, respectively, and increased 2009 oil revenues by $45 million.

Crude Oil Prices A substantial portion of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Companys control. Prices we received for crude oil in 2011 were 33 percent above 2010, with political unrest and economic uncertainty increasing market volatility. Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our balanced portfolio approach. International Dated Brent crudes and sweet crude from the Gulf Coast continue to be priced at a significant premium to WTI based prices. We are realizing these premium prices on approximately 76 percent of our crude oil production. Crude oil prices realized in 2011 averaged $102.19 per barrel, compared with $76.69 per barrel in 2010. Our Egypt, Australia, and North Sea regions, which comprise 58 percent of our worldwide oil production and receive Dated Brent premiums, had 2011 oil realizations averaging $108.55 per barrel compared with 2010 oil realizations of $78.18 per barrel. Our Gulf Coast regions, which comprise 18 percent of our worldwide oil production and receive similar premiums, had price realizations averaging $108.26 per barrel, an increase of 37 percent over 2010 realizations of $79.00 per barrel. 47 Table of Contents Crude oil tends to trade at a global price. With the exception of Argentina, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. In Argentina, we currently sell our oil in the domestic market. The Argentine government imposes a sliding scale tax on oil exports, which significantly influences prices domestic buyers are willing to pay. Domestic oil prices are currently indexed to a $42 per barrel base price, subject to quality adjustments and local premiums, and producers realize a gradual increase or decrease as market prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra del Fuego, similar pricing formulas exist; however, Apache retains the value added tax collected from buyers, effectively increasing realized prices by 21 percent. As a result, 2011 oil prices realized from Tierra del Fuego oil production averaged $65.03 per barrel as compared to our Neuqu&eacute;n basin production, which averaged $53.68 per barrel. Apache uses financial instruments to manage a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices, particularly in North America. In 2011, 29 percent of our oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges, reducing revenues by $379 million. In 2010, 12 percent of our oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges, reducing revenues by $57 million. For the year end status of our derivatives, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Natural Gas Prices Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. The majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing local market prices, which again illustrates the importance of a geographically balanced portfolio. Apache primarily sells natural gas into the North American market, where realized prices decreased six percent compared to 2010; however, approximately one third of our natural gas is produced outside North America, where our average contracted prices rose 27 percent from 2010. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, Australia, and Argentina. An overview of the market conditions in our primary gas producing regions follows. North America has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. In Egypt, our gas is sold to EGPC, primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMBtu. Under a legacy oil indexed contract, which expires at the end of 2012, there is no price cap for our gas up to 100 MMcf/d of gross production. Overall, the region averaged $4.66 per Mcf in 2011. Australia has historically had a local market with a limited number of buyers and sellers resulting in mostly long term, fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in the local consumer price index. Recent increases in demand and higher development costs have increased the prices required from the local market in order to support the development of new supplies. As a result, market prices received on recent contracts are substantially higher than historical levels. Argentina instituted the Gas Plus program in 2008 to encourage new gas supplies through the development of conventional and unconventional (tight sands) reserves. Under this program, Apache is allowed to sell gas from qualifying projects at prices that are above the regulated rates. During 2011, the average Gas Plus volume sold by Apache was 55.1 MMcf/d at an average price of $4.89 per Mcf. In addition, Apache signed or extended Gas Plus contracts with industrial consumers totaling gross rates of 15.5 MMcf/d at $4.28 per Mcf through December 31, 2012. Separate from the Gas Plus program, Apache sells volumes under Argentinas government regulated pricing and into Argentinas unregulated market. The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category. During 2011, we realized an average price of $1.06 per Mcf on government regulated sales and an average price of $3.14 per Mcf on our unregulated market sales. 48 Table of Contents Apache uses a variety of fixed price contracts and derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, primarily in North America. In 2011, 16 percent of our gas production was subject to financial derivative hedges, increasing revenues by $272 million. In 2010, 23 percent of our gas production was subject to financial derivative hedges, increasing revenues by $222 million.

For more specific information on marketing arrangements by country, please refer to Part I, Items 1 and 2 Business and Properties of this Form 10 K. Crude Oil Revenues 2011 vs. 2010 During 2011, crude oil revenues totaled $12.7 billion, $3.7 billion higher than the 2010 total of $9.0 billion, driven by a 33 percent increase in average realized prices and a five percent increase in worldwide production. Average daily production in 2011 was 339.9 Mb/d, with prices averaging $102.19 per barrel. Crude oil represented 75 percent of our 2011 oil and gas production revenues and 45 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 74 and 49 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Higher realized prices contributed $3.0 billion to the increase in full year revenues, while higher production volumes added another $0.7 billion. Worldwide oil production increased 17.0 Mb/d, driven by a 22.8 Mb/d increase in the US. The Permian region was up 11.6 Mb/d on properties added from the BP acquisitions, the Mariner merger and drilling and recompletion activity, offset by natural decline. The GOM onshore and offshore regions added 8.0 Mb/d as production from the Devon acquisition, the Mariner merger and drilling and recompletion activity was partially offset by natural decline. Central region production increased 3.2 Mb/d on drilling and recompletion activity. Egypts gross oil production increased 15 percent from additional capacity at the Kalabsha oil processing facility, a successful drilling and recompletion program, and volumes acquired in the 2010 BP acquisition. Egypts net production was up only five percent, as higher oil prices impact our cost recovery volumes. Australia production decreased 7.7 Mb/d as a result of repairs to the Van Gogh FPSO vessel, natural decline, and tropical cyclones in the first quarter of 2011. 2010 vs. 2009 During 2010, crude oil revenues totaled $9.0 billion, $2.9 billion higher than the 2009 total of $6.1 billion, driven by a 16 percent increase in worldwide production and a 28 percent increase in average realized prices. Average daily production in 2010 was 322.9 Mb/d, with prices averaging $76.69 per barrel. Crude oil represented 74 percent of our 2010 oil and gas production revenues and 49 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 71 percent and 48 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Higher realized prices contributed $1.7 billion to the increase in full year revenues, while higher production volumes added another $1.2 billion. Worldwide oil production increased 44.2 Mb/d, driven by a 36.1 Mb/d increase in Australia on new production from the Van Gogh and Pyrenees discoveries, which were brought online in the first quarter of 2010. U.S. production increased eight percent, or 7.4 Mb/d, with the Permian region up 4.4 Mb/d on properties added from the BP acquisitions, the Mariner merger, and drilling and recompletion activity. The Gulf Coast region added 1.8 Mb/d from properties acquired in the Devon acquisition, the Mariner merger, and drilling and recompletion activity. Central region production increased 1.2 Mb/d on drilling and recompletion activity. Gross production in Egypt increased 17 percent, while net production was up only eight percent, a function of the mechanics of our production sharing contracts. Net production increased 7.0 Mb/d on production gains in the Shushan, Matruh and numerous other concessions. Additional capacity at the Kalabsha oil processing facility, as well as processing of condensate rich gas through the Salam Gas Plant allowed by the new Jade manifold, allowed for much of the production gains. North Sea production decreased 4.2 Mb/d on natural decline and downtime. 49 Table of Contents Natural Gas Revenues 2011 vs. 2010 Natural gas revenues for 2011 of $3.6 billion were $747 million higher than 2010 on a five percent increase in realized prices and a 20 percent increase in production volumes. Realized prices in 2011 averaged $4.37 per Mcf, an increase of $0.22 per Mcf, which added $150 million to revenues. Worldwide production rose 374 MMcf/d, adding another $597 million to revenues. Worldwide gas production rose 20 percent, driven by a 236.5 MMcf/d, or 60 percent, increase in Canada on additional volumes from properties acquired from BP and an active drilling and completion program. U.S. daily production was up 133.9 MMcf/d, or 18 percent, primarily a result of 2010 acquisition activity. GOM onshore and offshore regions production rose 73.4 MMcf/d on new drilling activity and properties acquired from Devon and the Mariner merger. Permian region production was up 56.4 MMcf/d on incremental volumes from properties added from the BP acquisition and Mariner merger and on increased drilling activity. Argentinas production was up 27 MMcf/d from drilling and recompletions. Daily gas production in Australia fell 14.7 MMcf/d on downtime from tropical cyclones and customer maintenance activities resulting in lower takes under our existing contractual arrangements. Egypts gross production was up eight percent on a successful drilling program, additional gas throughput at the Obaiyed Gas Plant, and production from properties added in the BP acquisition. Net production was down three percent, as higher prices impacted our cost recovery volumes. 2010 vs. 2009 Natural gas revenues for 2010 of $2.9 billion were $493 million higher than 2009 on a 12 percent increase in realized prices and a seven percent increase in production volumes. Realized prices in 2010 averaged $4.15 per Mcf, an increase of $0.46 per Mcf, which added $297 million to revenues. Worldwide production rose 130 MMcf/d, adding another $197 million to revenues. Worldwide gas production rose in all of our core gas producing regions. U.S. production was up 64.8 MMcf/d, or 10 percent. Driven by new drilling, recompletion activity, and properties acquired from Devon and the Mariner merger, Gulf Coast region production was up 38.2 MMcf/d. Permian region production was up 20.1 MMcf/d, primarily on volumes from properties acquired from BP. Central region production was up 6.5 MMcf/d as additional production from new drilling and recompletions outpaced natural decline. Canada region production increased 36.8 MMcf/d as the result of an active drilling and completion program at Horn River and additional volumes from properties acquired from BP. Production in Australia was up 16.1 MMcf/d on higher customer takes from our John Brookes field. In Egypt, gross production was up 14 percent, while net production rose only three percent, a function of our production sharing contracts. The 12.2 MMcf/d increase in net production relative to 2009 was attributable to several factors, including a successful drilling and recompletion program on our Matruh concession, additional volumes processed through the Obaiyed Gas Plant and a full year of additional capacity provided by the completion of two new gas trains at the Salam Gas Plant. Argentinas production was up marginally as production from new drilling and recompletions was mostly offset by natural decline. 50 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context.

Our full cost depletion rate increased $2.05 to $13.97 per boe as costs to acquire, find, and develop reserves, which were significantly impacted by higher oil prices, exceeded our historical cost basis. In 2011, additional depletion expense of $60 million was 51 Table of Contents associated with the write off of the carrying value of our Chilean oil and gas property leases relinquished during 2011, and $49 million was associated with impairments of new venture seismic activity in countries where Apache is pursuing exploration opportunities but has not yet established a presence. Other asset depreciation increased $59 million over 2010 primarily on higher other asset balances from 2010 acquisitions. 2010 vs. 2009 Recurring full cost depletion expense increased $659 million on an absolute dollar basis: $342 million on higher rate and $317 million from additional production. Our full cost depletion rate increased $1.58 to $11.92 per boe as costs to acquire, find, and develop reserves exceeded our historical cost basis. In 2009, additional depletion expense of approximately $2.8 billion was associated with a non cash write down of the carrying value of our March 31, 2009, proved oil and gas property balances in the U.S. and Canada. Lease Operating Expenses Lease operating expenses (LOE) include several components: direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Oil, which contributed nearly half of our production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties, which account for all of our production in Australia and the North Sea and 86 percent of our production from the U.S. Gulf Coast regions, and in areas with remote plants and facilities. Workovers accelerate production; hence, activity generally increases with higher commodity prices. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations generally impact the Companys LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding to per unit costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar lowering per unit costs in our international regions. The following table details the LOE rate impact by component: For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Per boe Per boe 2010 LOE $ 8.47 2009 LOE $ 7.81 Acquisitions, net of associated production (0.02) Acquisitions, net of associated production 0.27 FX impact 0.23 FX impact 0.22 Labor and pumper costs 0.21 Equipment rental 0.22 Workover costs 0.18 Workover costs 0.16 Chemicals, power, and fuel 0.13 Stock based compensation 0.14 Transportation 0.11 Labor and pumper costs 0.08 Other 0.12 Material 0.07 Other decreased production 0.11 Chemicals, power, and fuel 0.07 2011 LOE $ 9.54 Other 0.20 Other increased production (0.77) 2010 LOE $ 8.47 2011 vs. 2010 Our 2011 LOE increased $573 million from 2010, or 28 percent. On a per unit basis, LOE increased 13 percent due to higher costs on the items listed above. 52 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Our 2010 LOE increased $370 million from 2009, or 22 percent. On a per unit basis, LOE increased eight percent with a 22 percent increase on higher costs, offset by a 14 percent decline related to increased production. The rate was impacted by the items listed above. Gathering and Transportation We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third party carrier, and receive a price with no transportation deduction. In this case, we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. In the U.S., Canada, and Argentina, we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay transportation charges to a third party carrier. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements. The following table presents gathering and transportation costs we paid directly to third party carriers for each of the periods presented: For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) U.S. $ 64 $ 42 $ 36 Canada 166 75 53 North Sea 25 25 26 Egypt 34 31 23 Argentina 7 5 5 Total Gathering and Transportation $ 296 $ 178 $ 143 2011 vs. 2010 Gathering and transportation costs increased $118 million from 2010. Canadas expense increased $91 million from a combination of an increase in gas volumes, higher average rates, and foreign exchange impacts. Average per unit costs were directly influenced by Apaches increased production in Canadas Horn River basin and properties acquired during 2010, where the associated gathering, processing, and transportation contracts have higher average rates than Apaches legacy properties. The $22 million increase in the U.S. is directly related to increased volumes. 2010 vs. 2009 Gathering and transportation costs increased $35 million from 2009. The increase in the U.S. resulted from an increase in both the volumes transported under arrangements where we pay costs directly to third parties and in rates. The increase in Canada resulted from an increase in volumes, rate, and foreign exchange rates. North Sea costs were down on lower production and foreign exchange rates. Egypt costs increased as a result of higher shipping, handling, and pipeline fees as compared to the prior year. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes other than income primarily consist of U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters off the coast of the U.S., Australia, and Argentina, and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. and Canada. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties and Nelson fields in the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety 53 Table of Contents of other taxes including U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum Resources Rent tax, and various Canadian taxes, including the Freehold Mineral tax, Saskatchewan Capital tax, and Saskatchewan Resources surtax. We also pay taxes on invoices and bank transactions in Argentina. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses: For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) U.K. PRT $ 538 $ 422 $ 383 Severance taxes 212 142 88 Ad valorem taxes 94 80 55 Other taxes 55 46 54 Total Taxes other than income $ 899 $ 690 $ 580 2011 vs. 2010 Taxes other than income were $209 million higher than 2010. U.K. PRT increased $116 million over the comparable 2010 period as a result of a 27 percent increase in net receipts, primarily driven by higher revenues. Prior year property acquisitions and higher realized oil and gas prices resulted in a $70 million and $14 million increase to severance and ad valorem tax expense, respectively. 2010 vs. 2009 Taxes other than income were $110 million higher than 2009. U.K. PRT increased $39 million over 2009 as a result of a 10 percent increase in net receipts, primarily driven by higher revenues. Severance taxes increased $54 million from higher taxable revenues in the U.S., predominantly resulting from acquisitions, and consistent with higher realized oil and natural gas prices relative to the prior year. The $25 million increase in ad valorem taxes resulted from higher taxable valuations in the U.S. associated with increases in oil and natural gas prices relative to the prior year and the BP and Devon acquisitions and the Mariner merger. General and Administrative Expenses 2011 vs. 2010 General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased $79 million, or 21 percent from 2010. On a per unit basis, G&A expenses increased six percent, or $.11 per boe: $.07 per boe on higher insurance costs and $.04 per boe on nonrecurring expenses. 2010 vs. 2009 G&A expenses were $36 million higher in 2010 than in 2009. On a per boe basis, G&A expenses decreased two percent as the effect of higher volumes more than offset the increase in costs. Merger, Acquisitions & Transition Costs In 2011, the Company recognized $20 million in merger, acquisitions, & transition costs, reflecting additional expenses related to our 2010 BP asset acquisitions and the Mariner merger as well as costs arising from our 2011 acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited. In 2010, the Company recognized $183 million in merger, acquisitions, & transition costs related to our BP and Devon acquisitions and the Mariner merger. A summary of these costs follows: For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 (In millions) Separation and retention costs $ 12 $ 114 Investment banking fees 42 Other costs 8 27 Total Merger, Acquisitions & Transition $ 20 $ 183 54 Table of Contents Financing Costs, Net Net financing costs incurred during the periods noted are composed of the following: For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Interest expense $ 433 $ 345 $ 309 Amortization of deferred loan costs 5 17 6 Capitalized interest (263) (120) (61) Interest income (17) (13) (12) Total Financing costs, net $ 158 $ 229 $ 242 2011 vs. 2010 Net financing costs decreased $71 million from 2010. The decrease is primarily related to a $143 million increase in capitalized interest, the result of additional unproved balances from the BP acquisitions and Mariner merger. This decrease is partially offset by an $88 million increase in interest expense from debt issuances in 2010. 2010 vs. 2009 Net financing costs decreased $13 million from 2009. The decrease is primarily related to a $59 million increase in capitalized interest, the result of additional unproved balances from the BP acquisitions and Mariner merger. This decrease is partially offset by a $36 million increase in interest expense from debt issuances in 2010 and $11 million higher amortization of deferred loan costs related to the new debt and repayment of the Australian project financing facility. Provision for Income Taxes 2011 vs. 2010 The provision for income taxes totaled $3.5 billion in 2011 compared to $2.2 billion in 2010, driven by a 55 percent increase in income before income taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate to 43.4 percent in 2011 from 41.8 percent in 2010. The largest driver of the increased tax rate was an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits from 50 percent to 62 percent. As a result of the enacted legislation, in 2011 the Company recorded a tax charge of $218 million resulting from the remeasurement of our U.K. deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2010. The effective rates for 2011 and 2010 were also impacted by the effect of currency exchange rates on our foreign deferred tax liabilities. 2010 vs. 2009 The provision for income taxes totaled $2.2 billion in 2010 compared to $611 million in 2009. The effective rates for 2010 and 2009 were impacted by the effect of currency exchange rates on our foreign deferred tax liabilities and other net tax settlements. Total taxes and the effective rate for 2009 were also impacted by the magnitude of the taxes related to the full cost write down in that year. Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures 2011 Activity On December 30, 2011, Apache completed the acquisition of Exxon Mobil Corporations U.K. subsidiary, Mobil North Sea Limited. The assets acquired include: operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields; operated interest in the Beryl/Brae gas pipeline and the SAGE gas plant; non operated interests in the Maclure, Scott, and Telford fields; and Benbecula (west of Shetlands) exploration acreage. This acquisition was funded with $1.25 billion of existing cash on hand. In February and March 2011, Apache completed two separate transactions to align ownership and interests on the planned Kitimat LNG facility and pipeline development. Apache Canada currently owns a 40 percent interest in both the Kitimat facility and the pipeline. 55 Table of Contents 2010 Activity In the fourth quarter of 2010, Apache acquired Mariner, an independent exploration and production company, in a stock and cash transaction totaling $2.7 billion. We also assumed approximately $1.7 billion of Mariners debt in connection with the merger. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, with Mariners assets and liabilities reflected in Apaches financial statements at fair value. Mariners oil and gas properties are primarily located in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater and shelf, the Permian Basin, and onshore in the Gulf Coast. The Permian Basin and Gulf of Mexico shelf assets are complementary to Apaches existing holdings and provide an inventory of future potential drilling locations, particularly in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formation oil plays of the Permian Basin. Additionally, Mariner has accumulated acreage in emerging unconventional shale oil resources in the U.S. In the third and fourth quarters of 2010, Apache completed the acquisition of BPs oil and gas operations, related infrastructure, and acreage in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, substantially all of BPs Western Canadian upstream natural gas assets, and BPs interests in four development licenses and one exploration concession (East Badr El Din) in the Western Desert of Egypt. The aggregate purchase price of the BP acquisitions, subsequent to exercise of preferential purchase rights, was $6.4 billion, subject to normal post closing adjustments. The effective date of these acquisitions was July 1, 2010. In the second quarter of 2010, Apache completed an acquisition of oil and gas assets on the Gulf of Mexico shelf from Devon for $1.05 billion, subject to normal post closing adjustments. The acquisition from Devon was effective January 1, 2010, and included 477,000 acres across 150 blocks. During the first quarter of 2010, Apache Canada, through its subsidiaries, closed the acquisition of a 51 percent interest in the Kitimat LNG facility and a 25.5 percent interest in a partnership that owns a related proposed pipeline. Subsequent Events The following significant transactions occurred subsequent to December 31, 2011: In January 2012, Apache agreed to acquire Cordillera Energy Partners III LLC, a privately held company with approximately 254,000 net acres in the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Cleveland, and Marmaton plays in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Upon closing, the sellers will receive approximately 6.3 million shares of Apache common stock and $2.2 billion in cash, to be funded with cash on hand and debt. The effective date of the transaction is September 1, 2011, with closing projected to be in the second quarter of 2012, subject to customary closing conditions. On January 31, 2012, a subsidiary of Apache Energy Limited acquired a 49 percent interest in Burrup Holdings Limited (BHL) for $439 million, including working capital adjustments. The transaction was funded with debt. BHL is the owner of an ammonia fertilizer plant on the Burrup Peninsula of Western Australia. Apache has been supplying natural gas to the plant since operations commenced in 2006. Yara Australia Pty Ltd (Yara) owns the remaining 51 percent of BHL and will operate the plant, which has been rebranded Yara Pilbara. Apache also acquired an interest in a planned technical ammonia nitrate plant to be developed with Yara. For further information regarding these acquisitions, please see Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. 56 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating cash flows are a primary source of liquidity. Apaches cash flows, both in the short term and the long term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices. Significant deterioration in commodity prices negatively impacts revenues, earnings and cash flows, capital spending, and potentially our liquidity if spending does not trend downward as well. Sales volumes and costs also impact cash flows; however, these historically have not been as volatile or as impactive as commodity prices in the short term. Apaches long term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the Company and its reserves, a critical source of future liquidity, will shrink. Cash investments are required continuously to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions, which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of our exploration and development activities or our ability to acquire additional reserves at reasonable costs. For a discussion of risk factors related to our business and operations, please see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. We may also elect to utilize available committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the occasional sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs. We believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to Apache, combined with internally generated cash flows, will be adequate to fund short term and long term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Apaches primary uses of cash are exploration, development, and acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs necessary to maintain ongoing operations, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt, and payment of dividends. We fund our exploration and development activities primarily through operating cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected cash flows. For additional information, please see Part I, Items 1 and 2 Business and Properties and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. 57 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the years presented: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,953 $ 6,726 $ 4,224 Commercial paper and bank loan borrowings, net 318 Sale of short term investments 792 Sale of oil and gas properties 422 3 Project financing draw downs 250 Fixed rate debt borrowings 2,470 Proceeds from issuance of common stock 2,258 Proceeds from issuance of depositary shares 1,227 Common stock activity 52 70 28 Other 32 36 35 10,459 13,105 5,332 Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Capital expenditures (1) 7,078 4,922 3,632 Acquisitions 1,813 8,360 310 Commercial paper, credit facility and bank loan repayments, net 925 2 Project financing repayment 350 Payments on fixed rate notes 1,023 100 Redemption of preferred stock 98 Dividends 306 226 209 Other 176 138 114 10,298 15,019 4,465 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 161 $ (1,914) $ 867 (1) The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short term and the long term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. The factors in determining operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, and deferred income tax expense, which affect earnings but do not affect cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 totaled $10.0 billion, up $3.3 billion from 2010. The increase reflects the $4.6 billion impact of higher oil and gas revenues, with higher commodity prices contributing $3.2 billion, and a 14 percent increase in daily equivalent production adding another $1.4 billion. This increase was partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2011 as compared to the 2010 period. For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see Results of Operations in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non cash expenses which do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. 58 Table of Contents Sale of Oil and Gas Properties During 2011, Apache completed the sale of certain properties in Canada and the U.S. for $422 million. Divestitures comprised several non strategic assets. Proceeds from Debt, Common Stock and Share Issuance On July 28, 2010, in conjunction with Apaches $6.4 billion acquisition of properties from BP, the Company issued 26.45 million shares of common stock and 25.3 million depositary shares. Proceeds, after underwriting discounts and before expenses, from the common stock and depositary share offerings totaled approximately $2.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. On August 20, 2010, the Company issued $1.5 billion principal amount of senior unsecured 5.1 percent notes maturing September 1, 2040. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings under a bridge facility and the Companys commercial paper program that were used to finance the 2010 BP acquisitions. On December 3, 2010, the Company issued $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured 3.625 percent notes maturing February 1, 2021, and $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured 5.25 percent notes maturing February 1, 2042. The proceeds were used to redeem the outstanding public debt of $1.0 billion assumed upon completion of Apaches acquisition of Mariner in November 2010. Repayment of Commercial Paper and Lines of Credit During 2011, Apache repaid $925 million on commercial paper and money market lines of credit. For further discussion of our commercial paper program, please see Liquidity in this Item 7 and Note 6 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Dividends The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 47 consecutive years through 2011. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. Common stock dividends paid during 2011 totaled $230 million, compared with $206 million in 2010 and $202 million in 2009. The 2011 and 2010 periods included dividend payments of $76 million and $20 million, respectively, on the Companys Series D Preferred Stock. The 2009 period included dividend payments of $7 million on the Companys Series B Preferred Stock. Capital Expenditures We fund exploration and development activities primarily through operating cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected operating cash flows. Our operating cash flows, both in the short and long term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses, and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, operating cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to these adjusted operating cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs. Historically, we have used a combination of operating cash flows, borrowings under lines of credit and commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund significant acquisitions. 59 Table of Contents The following table details capital expenditures for each country in which we do business. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Exploration and Development (E&D): United States $ 2,768 $ 1,623 $ 929 Canada 817 860 412 North America 3,585 2,483 1,341 Egypt 896 757 676 Australia 576 624 602 North Sea 823 617 375 Argentina 346 240 140 Other International 61 20 11 International 2,702 2,258 1,804 Worldwide Exploration and Development Costs 6,287 4,741 3,145 Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities (GTP): United States 27 Canada 148 159 83 Egypt 111 182 151 Australia 345 162 69 Argentina 12 3 2 Total GTP Costs 643 506 305 Asset Retirement Costs 819 459 288 Capitalized Interest 263 120 61 Capital Expenditures, excluding Acquisitions 8,012 5,826 3,799 Acquisitions, including GTP 3,189 11,557 310 Asset Retirement Costs Acquired 592 847 5 Total Capital Expenditures $ 11,793 $ 18,230 $ 4,114 Exploration and Development Apache continues to focus on spending within the limits of our operating cash flows. As a result of Apaches acquisitions in 2010 and the rise in commodity prices, our 2011 drilling and development budgets were increased while remaining below projected increases in operating cash flows in order to pay down debt. Accordingly, worldwide E&D expenditures for 2011 were 33 percent higher than 2010. E&D spending in North America, which totaled 57 percent of worldwide E&D spending, was up 44 percent in 2011 from the prior year on increased activity in every U.S. region. U.S. E&D expenditures were $1.1 billion, or 71 percent, higher than year ago levels primarily on activity in the Permian region, where we continue an aggressive drilling program on our Mariner acquired Deadwood acreage. Current year activity also includes expenditures on Mariner acquired deepwater properties for ongoing field development activities at Mandy, Wideberth, and Lucius. Our Central regions active horizontal drilling program in the Granite Wash and Cherokee plays further contributed to our increase in expenditures. E&D expenditures outside of North America increased 20 percent over 2010 to $2.7 billion. E&D spending in the North Sea was up $206 million from prior year levels on the Forties field drilling program and the 60 Table of Contents construction of the Forties Alpha satellite platform. Egypt was $139 million higher than the prior year on continued drilling activity across all major basins. Argentina expenditures were up $106 million on additional drilling and development activity. Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities We invested $643 million in GTP in 2011 compared to $506 million in 2010. GTP expenditures in Australia consisted of construction activity at the Devil Creek and Macedon gas plants. Australia has also incurred costs related to the FEED study and purchases of long lead items for the Wheatstone LNG project. Activity in Canada was centered on the Kitimat LNG development and in the Horn River basin, with expenditures for compressor stations, a water treatment facility, gathering systems, and a gas processing plant. Expenditures in Egypt primarily comprised final stages of construction on the Kalabsha oil processing facility. In addition, approximately $338 million of the value of our 2011 acquisitions is associated with GTP. Asset Retirement Costs In 2011, we recorded $819 million of additional future asset retirement costs associated with our worldwide drilling programs and upward revisions to prior year estimates for timing and costs. Acquisitions We acquired $3.2 billion of oil and gas properties in 2011 compared to $11.6 billion in 2010. We also assumed $592 million in asset retirement costs. Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive opportunities arise and, therefore, vary from year to year. For information regarding our acquisitions and divestitures, please see Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures in this Item 7 and Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Liquidity At December 31, (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 295 $ 134 Total debt 7,216 8,141 Shareholders equity 28,993 24,377 Available committed borrowing capacity 3,300 2,387 Floating rate debt/total debt 0.4% 12% Percent of total debt to capitalization 20% 25% Cash and Cash Equivalents We had $295 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011, of which $237 million of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately $58 million was held by Apache Corporation and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. Almost all of the cash is denominated in U.S. dollars and, at times, is invested in highly liquid, investment grade securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We intend to use cash from our international subsidiaries to fund international projects. Debt At December 31, 2011, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes, debentures, commercial paper, and uncommitted bank lines, totaled $7.2 billion. Current debt consists of $400 million in 6.25 percent debentures due in April 2012 and $31 million borrowed under uncommitted money market/overdraft lines of credit in Argentina. We have $900 million of debt maturing in 2013, $350 million maturing in 2015, and the remaining $5.6 billion maturing intermittently in years 2016 through 2096. The Companys debt to capitalization ratio as of December 31, 2011 was 20 percent as compared to 25 percent at December 31, 2010. 61 Table of Contents Available Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2011, the Company had unsecured committed revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling $3.3 billion, of which $2.3 billion matures in May 2013 and $1.0 billion matures in August 2016. The facilities consist of a $1.5 billion facility, a $1.0 billion facility and a $450 million facility in the U.S., a $200 million facility in Australia, and a $150 million facility in Canada. As of December 31, 2011, available borrowing capacity under the Companys credit facilities was $3.3 billion. The U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apaches commercial paper program. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S. and Canada of up to five percent of the Companys consolidated assets, or approximately $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2011. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group. There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache, or any of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2011. At the Companys option, the interest rate for the facilities is based on a base rate, as defined, or LIBOR plus a margin determined by the Companys senior long term debt rating. At December 31, 2011, the margin over LIBOR for committed loans was 0.19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility, 0.875 percent on the $1.0 billion facility, and 0.23 percent on the $450 million facility in the U.S., the $200 million facility in Australia, and the $150 million facility in Canada. If the total amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then an additional 0.05 percent will be added to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans borrowed under the $450 million facility in the U.S., the $200 million facility in Australia, and the $150 million facility in Canada equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then an additional 0.10 percent will be added to the margins over LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of 0.06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion facility, 0.125 percent on the total amount of the $1.0 billion facility, and 0.07 percent on the total amount of the other three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the Companys senior long term debt rating. Substantially all of the banks with lending commitments to the Company have credit ratings of at least single A, which in some cases is based on government support. There is no assurance that the financial condition of these banks will not deteriorate. We closely monitor the ratings of the 28 banks in our bank group. Having a large bank group allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any banks failure to honor its lending commitment. Commercial Paper Program The Company has available a $2.95 billion commercial paper program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. Our 2011 weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was 0.37 percent. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys U.S. credit facilities are available as a 100 percent 62 Table of Contents backstop. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under U.S. committed credit facilities, which expire in 2013 and 2016. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. Future Debt and Stock Issuances Subsequent to year end, Apache plans to issue additional equity and debt in conjunction with the recently announced Cordillera Energy acquisition. As discussed above in Significant Acquisitions and Divestures in this Item 7, the Company is planning to issue approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock to the sellers and fund the remaining $2.2 billion balance with cash on hand and debt at closing, which is projected to be in the second quarter of 2012. Dividend Increase Based on strong future growth prospects and Apaches financial position, the Board of Directors approved a 13 percent increase to $0.17 per share for the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Companys common shares. This increase applies to the dividend on common shares payable on May 22, 2012, to stockholders of record on April 23, 2012. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in Contractual Obligations in this Item 7. Other than the off balance sheet arrangements described herein, Apache does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 6 Debt and Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K.

For additional information regarding these liabilities, please see Notes 5, 3, 8, and 7, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. (b) This represents minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. Apaches expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent Apache utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract. 63 Table of Contents (c) Purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and specify all significant terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. These include minimum commitments associated with take or pay contracts, hydraulic fracturing service agreements, obtaining and processing seismic data, and contractual obligations to buy or build oil and gas plants and facilities. (d) Other operating lease obligations pertain to other long term exploration, development, and production activities. The Company has work related commitments for oil and gas operations equipment, acreage maintenance commitments, FPSOs, and aircraft, among other things. Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $120 million for environmental remediation and approximately $20 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. The Company also had approximately $118 million accrued as of December 31, 2011, for an insurance contingency as a member of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). This insurance co op insures specific property, pollution liability, and other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay a withdrawal premium if we elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential withdrawal premium is calculated annually based on past losses and the nature of our asset base. Insurance Program We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our assets, third party liability, workers compensation, employers liability, sudden pollution, and other risks. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. These policies also provide sudden pollution coverage. Coverage for damage to our U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets specifically resulting from a named windstorm, however, is subject to a maximum of $250 million per named windstorm, which includes a self insured retention of 40 percent of the losses above a $100 million deductible, and is limited to a maximum of two storms per year. Our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide coverage of $610 million per occurrence subject to Apaches interest. This coverage is in excess of existing policies, including, but not limited to, charterers liability, aircraft liability, employers liability, and automobile liability. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service providers employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider. Our insurance policies generally renew in January and June of each year. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable. Apache purchases multi year political risk insurance from the OPIC and other highly rated international insurers covering its investments in Egypt. In the aggregate, these policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $1 billion of coverage to Apache for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks, with a $237.5 million sub limit for currency inconvertibility. In addition, 64 Table of Contents the Company has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $225 million of coverage, including a self insured retention of $37.5 million, for losses arising from (1) non payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum when actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. Non GAAP Measures The Company makes reference to some measures in discussion of its financial and operating highlights that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these measures in assessing operating results and believes the presentation of these measures provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations. These non GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used at other companies. Adjusted Earnings To assess the Companys operating trends and performance, management uses Adjusted Earnings, which is net income excluding certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Management believes this presentation may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts who adjust reported company earnings for items that may obscure underlying fundamentals and trends. The reconciling items below are the types of items management excludes and believes are frequently excluded by analysts when evaluating the operating trends and comparability of the Companys results.

Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apaches financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. The following is a discussion of Apaches most critical accounting policies. Reserves Estimates Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures. Reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing. Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations. ARO associated with retiring tangible long lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apaches oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the 66 Table of Contents present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. Income Taxes Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions meet certain legislative, judicial, and regulatory requirements. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired companys assets and liabilities and tax related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we made various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in Reserve Estimates of this Item 7. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. 67 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Commodity Risk The Companys revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments, and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile due to unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather, and political climate. In 2011, our average worldwide crude oil realizations saw a significant increase from $91.74 per barrel in January to $110.98 in April, followed by a decrease to $97.88 in August. In 2011, crude oil prices averaged $102.19 per barrel, up 33 percent from 2010. Apaches average worldwide natural gas price realizations remained within a $0.44 range during 2011, with a high of $4.58 per Mcf in June and July, as compared to a $0.95 range during 2010. Average realized prices in 2011 for natural gas increased five percent to $4.37 per Mcf. We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. In 2011, approximately 16 percent of our natural gas production and 29 percent of our crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges, compared with 23 percent and 12 percent, respectively, in 2010. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options, and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. On December 31, 2011, the Company had open natural gas derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of $426 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately $39 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately $38 million. The Company also had open crude oil derivatives in a liability position with a fair value of $248 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would increase the liability by approximately $193 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would decrease the liability by approximately $170 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2011. For notional volumes and terms associated with the Companys derivative contracts, please see Note 3 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy. The Risk Committee approves and oversees these controls, which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit, limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Interest Rate Risk The Company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on approximately 99.6 percent of the Companys debt. At December 31, 2011, total debt included $31 million of floating rate debt. A 10 percent change in floating interest rates on year end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately $742,000. 68 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and gas production is sold largely under fixed price Australian dollar contracts. Approximately half the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in U.S. dollars. In Canada, oil and gas prices and costs, such as equipment rentals and services, are generally denominated in Canadian dollars but heavily influenced by U.S. markets. Our North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars, but are converted into Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, and Argentine pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of Other under Revenues and Other or, as is the case when we re measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Companys provision for income tax expense on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. A 10 percent strengthening or weakening of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Argentine peso as of December 31, 2011, would result in a foreign currency net loss or gain, respectively, of approximately $150 million.
