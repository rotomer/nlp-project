ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL RESULTS SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 2001 2000 1999 millions except per share amounts Revenues $8,369 $5,500 $1,706 Costs and expenses 8,687 4,081 1,531 Merger expenses 45 67 Interest expense 92 93 74 Other (income) expense (65) (167) (4) Net income (loss) available to common stockholders before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ (183) $ 813 $ 32 Net income (loss) available to common stockholders $ (188) $ 796 $ 32 Earnings (loss) per share before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle basic $(0.73) $ 4.42 $ 0.25 Earnings (loss) per share before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle diluted $(0.73) $ 4.25 $ 0.25 Earnings (loss) per share basic $(0.75) $ 4.32 $ 0.25 Earnings (loss) per share diluted $(0.75) $ 4.16 $ 0.25 NET INCOME Anadarkos net loss available to common stockholders for 2001 totaled $188 million, or $0.75 per share (diluted), compared to net income available to common stockholders for 2000 of $796 million, or $4.16 per share (diluted). Net income for 2001 includes non cash charges of $2.55 billion ($1.58 billion after taxes) for impairments of the carrying value of oil and gas properties primarily in the United States, Canada and Argentina as a result of low natural gas and oil prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001 as well as impairments related to exploration efforts in various international locations during 2001. See Critical Accounting Policies. Excluding the impairments, Anadarko had net income available to common stockholders of $1.39 billion, or $5.25 per share (diluted) for 2001. Net income for 2000 includes non cash charges of $50 million ($32 million after taxes) for impairments related to exploration efforts in various international locations. Excluding the impairments, Anadarko had net income available to common stockholders in 2000 of $828 million or $4.32 per share (diluted). Anadarkos 1999 net income included a non cash charge of $24 million ($15 million after taxes) related to impairments for exploration efforts in various international locations. Excluding the impairments, Anadarko had net income in 1999 of $47 million, or $0.37 per share (diluted). Anadarkos results include the effect of the merger with Union Pacific Resources Group Inc., subsequently renamed RME Holding Company (RME), which closed in July 2000, and the acquisition of Berkley Petroleum Corp. (Berkley), which closed in March 2001. 31 REVENUES 2001 2000 1999 millions Gas sales $2,893 $1,591 $ 353 Oil and condensate sales 1,380 948 247 Natural gas liquids sales 255 264 88 Marketing sales 3,776 2,637 1,016 Minerals and other 65 60 2 Total $8,369 $5,500 $1,706 Total revenues for 2001 increased $2.87 billion or 52% compared to 2000. Natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) revenues for 2001 increased $1.73 billion or 62% to $4.53 billion compared to $2.80 billion for 2000, due primarily to a significant increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in crude oil, condensate and NGLs prices. Marketing sales for 2001 increased $1.14 billion or 43% compared to 2000. The increase in marketing sales was due primarily to an increase in marketing sales volumes, which was partly offset by an increase in marketing purchases of $1.07 billion resulting primarily from higher oil and gas volumes purchased from third parties. Anadarkos total revenues for 2000 were up $3.79 billion or 222% compared to total revenues in 1999. Natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs revenues for 2000 increased $2.11 billion or 307% to $2.80 billion compared to $0.69 billion for 1999, due primarily to a significant increase in sales volumes and commodity prices. Marketing sales for 2000 increased $1.62 billion or 160% compared to 1999. The increase in marketing sales was due primarily to an increase in commodity prices, which was offset by an increase in marketing purchases of $1.67 billion resulting primarily from increased commodity prices for gas and oil volumes purchased from third parties. ANALYSIS OF OIL AND GAS SALES VOLUMES 2001 2000 1999 BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT (MMBOE) United States 144 83 44 Canada 34 12 Algeria 8 10 6 Other International 13 7 Total 199 112 50 MMBOE million barrels of oil equivalent During 2001, Anadarko sold 199 MMBOE, an increase of 87 MMBOE or 78% compared to sales of 112 MMBOE in 2000. Approximately 70% of the increase in volumes during 2001 was due to a full year of operations in 2001 from properties acquired with the RME merger in July 2000, compared to 5 1/2 months of operations in 2000. The remainder of the increase in volumes during 2001 was due primarily to increases of approximately 13 MMBOE from operations in the Gulf of Mexico, 7 MMBOE related to the acquisition of Berkley in March 2001, 6 MMBOE from operations in the Bossier play in Texas and Louisiana and 5 MMBOE from operations in Alaska. The Companys sales volumes were up 62 MMBOE or 124% in 2000 compared to 50 MMBOE in 1999. About 85% of the increase in volumes in 2000 was due to the merger with RME in mid 2000. The remainder of the increase in volumes during 2000 was due primarily to increases of 4 MMBOE from the Companys operations in Algeria. Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage production and sales volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future.

Approximately 70% of the increase in natural gas volumes during 2001 was due to a full year of production in 2001 from properties acquired with the RME merger compared to 5 1/2 months of production in 2000. The remainder of the increase in volumes during 2001 was due primarily to increases of approximately 44 Bcf from operations in the Gulf of Mexico, 34 Bcf from the Bossier play in Texas and Louisiana and 29 Bcf related to the acquisition of Berkley in March 2001. Anadarkos natural gas sales volumes in 2000 were up 215 Bcf or 126% compared to 1999. About 85% of the increase in natural gas volumes in 2000 was due to the merger with RME in July 2000. The remainder of the increase in volumes during 2000 was primarily due to increased production in the Bossier play in east Texas and Louisiana. Production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand. However, the Company may decide during periods of low commodity prices to decrease development activity, which can result in decreased production volumes. The Companys average wellhead gas price in 2001 was essentially flat compared to 2000. The higher natural gas prices realized in the first half of 2001 were offset by a decrease in natural gas prices in the second half of 2001. The decrease in prices during 2001 were attributed to a severe decline in natural gas demand as a result of high prices in early 2001, a national economic downturn and mild summer weather. The Company had less than 5% of its forecasted 2002 natural gas wellhead sales volumes hedged as of December 31, 2001. As a result, future natural gas revenues are subject to continued volatility based on fluctuations in market prices. Anadarkos average wellhead gas price in 2000 increased 99% from 1999. Natural gas markets improved significantly in 2000, with the Companys average realized price increasing from $2.08 per Mcf in 1999 to $4.13 per Mcf in 2000. The stronger prices were the result of lower nationwide production volumes and higher gas demand, particularly from electric power generation facilities. 33 QUARTERLY NATURAL GAS SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE PRICES 2001 2000 1999 FIRST QUARTER Bcf 164 44 44 MMcf/d 1,822 486 489 Price per Mcf $ 6.79 $ 2.46 $1.59 SECOND QUARTER Bcf 184 49 42 MMcf/d 2,018 536 461 Price per Mcf $ 4.49 $ 3.20 $1.95 THIRD QUARTER Bcf 176 138 42 MMcf/d 1,913 1,498 456 Price per Mcf $ 2.89 $ 3.83 $2.40 FOURTH QUARTER Bcf 171 154 42 MMcf/d 1,863 1,676 456 Price per Mcf $ 2.59 $ 5.18 $2.40 CRUDE OIL AND CONDENSATE SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE PRICES 2001 2000 1999 UNITED STATES (MMBBLS) 34 15 9 MBbls/d 93 40 23 Price per barrel before hedge $22.70 $29.09 $15.87 Effect of hedge per barrel 0.22 (0.37) (0.08) Price per barrel $22.92 $28.72 $15.79 CANADA (MMBBLS) 13 4 MBbls/d 35 12 Price per barrel before hedge $16.90 $27.07 Effect of hedge per barrel 0.43 0.31 Price per barrel $17.33 $27.38 ALGERIA (MMBBLS) 8 10 6 MBbls/d 22 26 17 Price per barrel $23.97 $28.76 $18.23 OTHER INTERNATIONAL (MMBBLS) 13 7 MBbls/d 36 20 Price per barrel before hedge $14.35 $18.46 Effect of hedge per barrel (0.11) Price per barrel $14.35 $18.35 TOTAL (MMBBLS) 68 36 15 MBbls/d 186 98 40 Price per barrel before hedge $20.14 $26.62 $16.87 Effect of hedge per barrel 0.18 (0.13) (0.04) Price per barrel $20.32 $26.49 $16.83 MMBbls million barrels MBbls/d thousand barrels per day 34 Anadarkos crude oil and condensate sales volumes in 2001 increased 32 MMBbls or 89% compared to 2000. Approximately 65% of the increase in sales volumes during 2001 was due to a full year of operations in 2001 from properties acquired with the RME merger compared to 5 1/2 months of operations in 2000. The remainder of the increase in crude oil and condensate sales volumes during 2001 was due primarily to increases of approximately 6 MMBbls from operations in the Gulf of Mexico, 5 MMBbls in Alaska and 2 MMBbls related to the acquisition of Berkley in March 2001. The 2000 oil and condensate volumes increased 21 MMBbls or 140% compared to 1999. About 85% of the increase in sales volumes in 2000 was due to the merger with RME in July 2000. The remainder of the increase in volumes during 2000 was due primarily to increases of 4 MMBbls from the Companys operations in Algeria. Production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices. Anadarkos average realized crude oil prices for 2001 decreased 23% compared to 2000. The decrease in crude oil prices during 2001 is attributed primarily to a modest increase in supply and very slow growth in demand due to a worldwide economic downturn and a sharp decline in jet fuel consumption. The Company had less than 8% of its forecasted 2002 crude oil wellhead sales volumes hedged as of December 31, 2001. As a result, future oil and condensate revenues are subject to continued volatility based on fluctuations in market prices. Crude oil prices in 2000 were up 57% compared to 1999. The improvement in crude oil prices for 2000 was due in large part to a decrease in the production quotas among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

NGLs sales volumes in 2000 increased 71% compared to 1999. The 2001 average NGLs prices decreased 24% compared to 2000. By comparison, 2000 NGLs prices were 62% above 1999. NGLs production is dependent on natural gas prices and the economics of processing the natural gas volumes to extract NGLs. 35 COSTS AND EXPENSES 2001 2000 1999 millions Marketing purchases $3,704 $2,638 $ 972 Operating expenses 716 438 179 Administrative and general 247 180 102 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,154 593 218 Other taxes 247 128 36 Provisions for doubtful accounts 23 Impairments related to oil and gas properties 2,546 50 24 Amortization of goodwill 73 31 Total $8,687 $4,081 $1,531 During 2001, Anadarkos costs and expenses increased $4.61 billion or 113% compared to 2000 due to the following factors: Marketing purchases increased $1.07 billion (40%) due primarily to an increase in oil and gas volumes purchased from third parties. Operating expenses increased $278 million (63%) primarily due to a significant increase in the number of producing wells as a result of the RME merger in mid 2000, the Berkley acquisition in early 2001 and significant development activity in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and the Bossier play in east Texas and Louisiana. Operating expenses were also impacted by an increase in oil field service costs. Administrative and general expenses increased $67 million (37%) primarily due to the Companys expanded workforce resulting from the RME merger in mid 2000 and higher costs associated with the Companys growing workforce. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense increased $561 million (95%). About 80% of the increase was due to the increase in volumes as a result of the RME merger, the Berkley acquisition and significant development activity. The remaining increase is due to increases in the DD&A rate, which is also due to the RME merger and Berkley acquisition. As a result of the ceiling test impairments related to low oil and gas prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001, DD&A expense will be reduced in the future. Other taxes increased $119 million (93%). Approximately 50% of the increase was due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of the significant increase in properties as a result of the merger and acquisitions. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to an increase in production taxes as a result of the increase in volumes. Impairments in 2001 were due to low oil and gas prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001, which resulted in ceiling test impairments for the United States ($1.70 billion), Canada ($808 million), Argentina ($15 million) and Brazil ($4 million), as well as unsuccessful exploration activities in the United Kingdom ($11 million) and Ghana ($7 million). Amortization of goodwill increased $42 million due to the RME merger in mid 2000 ($32 million) and the Berkley acquisition in 2001 ($10 million). During 2000, Anadarkos costs and expenses increased $2.55 billion or 167% compared to 1999 due to the following factors: Marketing purchases increased $1.67 billion (171%) due primarily to an increase in commodity prices for gas and oil volumes purchased from third parties. Operating expenses increased $259 million (145%) due primarily to the significant increase in number of producing wells as a result of the RME merger and higher downstream expenses associated with an increase in NGLs production. Administrative and general expenses were up $78 million (76%) due primarily to an increase in costs associated with the Companys growing workforce as a result of the RME merger in mid 2000. DD&A expense increased $375 million (172%). About 76% of the increase was due to a 124% increase in volumes as a result of the RME merger and higher volumes in Algeria and the Bossier 36 play in east Texas and Louisiana. The remaining increase is due primarily to an increase in the DD&A rate as a result of the RME merger. Other taxes increased $92 million (256%). Approximately 75% of the increase was due to an increase in production taxes as a result of higher volumes associated with the RME merger and an increase in commodity prices in 2000. The remainder of the increase was due to higher ad valorem taxes as a result of the significant increase in properties and higher payroll taxes as a result of the increase in employees as a result of the RME merger. Provisions for doubtful accounts increased $23 million due to default by one creditor. Impairments in 2000 related to unsuccessful exploration activities in the United Kingdom ($17 million), Tunisia ($13 million), Ireland ($10 million) and other international locations ($10 million). Amortization of goodwill was $31 million due to the RME merger in mid 2000. MERGER EXPENSES During 2001 and 2000, merger costs of $41 million and $67 million, respectively, were expensed related to the RME merger. These costs relate primarily to the issuance of stock for retention of employees, deferred compensation, transition, integration, hiring and relocation costs, vesting of restricted stock and stock options and retention bonuses. For 2001, merger costs of $4 million were expensed related to the Berkley and Gulfstream Resources Canada Limited (Gulfstream) acquisitions. There were no merger related expenses in 1999. Any additional expenses related to the RME, Berkley or Gulfstream acquisitions are expected to be minimal and will be included in administrative and general expenses in the future. INTEREST EXPENSE 2001 2000 1999 millions Gross interest expense $ 301 $ 193 $ 96 Capitalized interest (209) (100) (22) Net interest expense $ 92 $ 93 $ 74 Anadarkos gross interest expense has increased over the past three years due primarily to the RME merger in mid 2000 and the Berkley acquisition in 2001 as well as higher levels of borrowings for capital expenditures, including producing property acquisitions. Gross interest expense in 2001 increased 56% compared to 2000 primarily due to the RME merger in mid 2000 and the Berkley acquisition in 2001 which resulted in higher average borrowings during 2001. Gross interest expense in 2000 was up 101% compared to 1999 primarily due to the RME merger and higher average borrowings in 2000. See Capital Resources and Liquidity and Outlook on Liquidity. In 2001, capitalized interest increased by 109% compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in costs excluded from the DD&A pools related to the RME merger in mid 2000 and the Berkley acquisition in 2001. In 2000, capitalized interest increased by 355% compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in costs excluded related to the RME merger. For additional information about the Companys policies regarding costs excluded and capitalized interest see Critical Accounting Policies Costs Excluded and Capitalized Interest.

Other income for 2000 includes $175 million related to the effect of significantly higher market values for firm transportation subject to a keep whole agreement. The keep whole agreement was acquired with the RME merger in 2000. See Derivative Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10 K. MARKETING STRATEGIES OVERVIEW The Companys sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale. Therefore, even though the Company has several large purchasers, the Company believes other purchasers would be willing to buy the Companys natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs at comparable market prices. The Companys marketing department actively manages sales of its oil and gas through Anadarko Energy Services Company (AES), Anadarko, Anadarko Canada Corporation and RME. The Company also conducts trading activities for the purpose of generating profits on or from exposure to changes in the market prices of gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. However, the Company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities. The Companys trading risk position, most of the time, is a net short position that is offset by the Companys natural long position as a producer. Essentially all of the Companys trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months. See Derivative Financial Instruments under Item 7a of this Form 10 K. NATURAL GAS The North American natural gas market has grown significantly throughout the last 10 years and management believes continued growth to be likely. Natural gas prices have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be so. Management believes the Companys excellent portfolio of exploration and development prospects should position Anadarko to continue to participate in this growth. Anadarkos wholly owned marketing subsidiary AES is a full service marketing company offering supply assurance, competitive pricing and services tailored to its customers needs. Approximately 36% of the Companys gas production was sold through AES in 2001. AES also purchases and sells third party produced gas in the Companys market areas. Third party purchases allow the Company to aggregate larger volumes of gas and attract larger, more creditworthy customers, which in turn spreads the Companys relatively fixed overhead costs over more gas and can help to reduce transportation costs. AES sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. AES has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the "daily" gas market to take advantage of any price volatility. Included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative financial instruments. The Company also conducts trading activities for the purpose of generating profits on or from exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas. RME was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported the gas marketing program within the gathering, processing and marketing (GPM) business segment, which was sold in 1999 to Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. (Duke). Most of the GPMs firm long term transportation contracts were transferred to Duke in the GPM disposition. One contract was retained, but is managed and operated by Duke. Anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the Companys natural gas. As part of the GPM disposition, RME and Duke signed a keep whole agreement, under which RME will pay Duke if the transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates, while Duke will pay RME if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates (keep whole agreement). The fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated with actively quoted natural gas basis prices. Basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the NYMEX gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices, discounted at a 10% per year. Management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors (such as expected drilling activity, anticipated pipeline construction projects, expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points) that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted. 38 In 2001 and 2000, approximately 31% and 56%, respectively, of the Companys gas production was sold under long term contracts to Duke Energy. These sales represent 17% and 18%, respectively, of total revenues in 2001 and 2000. Most of the Companys gas production sold to Duke Energy is under a single agreement that expires at the end of the first quarter of 2004. Volumes sold to Duke under this contract may be delivered at a number of locations generally at the tailgate of processing facilities owned or operated by Duke Energy or its affiliates and typically in the general vicinity of the fields where produced. The pricing of gas under this contract is market based and therefore varies monthly and by region. CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE AND NGLS Anadarkos crude oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Canada, Algeria and other international areas. Most of the Companys U.S. crude oil and NGLs production is on 30 day "evergreen" contracts with prices based on marketing indices and adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Most of the Companys Canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater. Oil from Algeria is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel. AES purchases and sells third party crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Companys domestic and international market areas. Included in this strategy is the use of leased crude oil storage facilities and various derivative financial instruments. GAS GATHERING SYSTEMS AND PROCESSING Anadarkos investment in gas gathering operations allows the Company to better manage its gas production, improve ultimate recovery of reserves, enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities. The Company has invested $173 million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years. The vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from Anadarko operated wells. The Company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction and sale of NGLs in efficient plants with flexible commitments. Anadarko also processes gas and has interests in one operated plant and three non operated plants. Anadarkos strategy to aggregate gas through Company owned and third party gathering systems allows Anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the Company has significant production. Anadarko purchased Pinnacle Gas Treating, Inc., for $38 million, in January 2001. The purchase gives Anadarko ownership of a natural gas gathering system that runs through the heart of its Bossier properties. The acquisition provides the Company greater flexibility in shipping and marketing its gas from the area as well as improved service to other shippers. The network, which has a capacity of 500 MMcf/d of gas, consists of 60 miles of large diameter pipe, 40 miles of small diameter laterals and spurs in addition to a 60 mile fuel redelivery system. In 2001, Anadarko expanded the Bethel plant acquired in the transaction to accommodate growing volumes in the area. The Bethel treating plant removes carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from gas and can handle as much as 500 MMcf/d of gas. MARKETING CONTRACTS The following schedules provide additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio of physical and derivative contracts and the firm transportation keep whole agreement as of December 31, 2001. The Company records income on these activities using the mark to market method. See Critical Accounting Policies for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives are calculated. In 2001, the use of mark to market accounting compared to historical cost accounting resulted in additional non cash income of $31 million, before taxes, related to the marketing and trading activities and reduced non cash income related to the firm transportation keep whole agreement by $74 million, before taxes.

This compares to 709 gross wells (385 gas wells, 269 oil wells and 55 dry holes) in 2000 and 200 gross wells (122 gas wells, 52 oil wells and 26 dry holes) in 1999. The increase in activity during 2001 was a result of the RME merger, the Berkley acquisition and improved commodity prices at the beginning of the year. The Companys 2001 exploration and development drilling program is discussed in Oil and Gas Properties and Activities under Item 1 of this Form 10 K.

Net: working interest ownership. RESERVE REPLACEMENT Drilling activity is not the best measure of success for an exploration and production company. Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves, among other factors. The Company believes its performance in both areas is excellent. For the 20th consecutive year, Anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs, stated on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis. 40 During 2001, Anadarkos worldwide reserve replacement was 221% of total production which reached a record of 201 MMBOE. The Companys worldwide reserve replacement in 2000 was 1,059% of total production of 112 MMBOE. The Companys worldwide reserve replacement in 1999 was 213% of total production of 50 MMBOE. Over the last five years, the Companys annual reserve replacement has averaged 476% of annual production volumes. Excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, Anadarkos worldwide reserve replacement for 2001 was 173% of total production compared to 231% for 2000 and 236% for 1999. Excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, the Companys annual worldwide reserve replacement over the past five years averaged 243% of annual production volumes. Anadarko continues to increase its energy reserves in the U.S. In 2001, the Company replaced 161% of its U.S. production volumes with U.S. reserves. This compares to a U.S. reserve replacement of 855% in 2000 and 128% in 1999. The Companys U.S. reserve replacement for the five year period 1997 2001 was 360% of production. Excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, Anadarkos U.S. reserve replacement for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was 160%, 207% and 101%, respectively, of total production. The Companys U.S. reserve replacement for the five year period 1997 2001 was 195% excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. By comparison, the most recent published U.S. industry average (1996 2000) was 109%. (Source: U.S. Department of Energy) Anadarkos U.S. reserve replacement performance for the same period 1996 2000 was 452% of production or 218% of production, excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. Industry data for 2001 are not yet available. COST OF FINDING Cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development. A better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period. Anadarko has historically outperformed the industry in average finding costs. For the period 1997 2001, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost was $6.66 per BOE. The Companys U.S. finding cost for the same five year period was $7.58 per BOE. Excluding mergers and acquisitions, Anadarkos worldwide and U.S. finding costs for the five year period 1997 2001 were $5.88 per BOE and $6.78 per BOE, respectively. Industry data for 2001 are not yet available. For comparison purposes, the most recently published five year average (1996 2000) for the industry shows worldwide finding cost was $4.32 per BOE and U.S. finding cost was $5.63 per BOE. (Source: Arthur Andersen) For the same five year period of 1996 2000, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost was $5.89 per BOE and its U.S. finding cost was $6.86 per BOE. For the five year period 1996 2000, the Companys worldwide and U.S. finding costs excluding mergers and acquisitions were $4.30 per BOE and $5.15 per BOE, respectively. For 2001, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost was $8.53 per BOE. This compares to $7.19 per BOE in 2000 and $4.87 per BOE in 1999. Anadarkos U.S. finding cost for 2001 was $9.60 per BOE. This compares to $8.49 per BOE in 2000 and $9.06 per BOE in 1999. Excluding mergers and acquisitions, Anadarkos worldwide finding costs for 2001 was $8.75 per BOE compared to $5.83 per BOE in 2000 and $5.17 per BOE in 1999. The Companys U.S. finding costs excluding mergers and acquisitions for 2001 was $9.46 per BOE compared to $6.77 per BOE in 2000 and $11.52 per BOE in 1999. Finding costs in 2001 have increased due primarily to increases in oilfield services costs and increased exploration and development activity. PROVED RESERVES At the end of 2001, Anadarkos proved reserves were 2.3 billion BOE compared to 2.1 billion BOE at year end 2000 and 991 MMBOE at year end 1999. Reserves increased 12% in 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily to exploration and development drilling in both the U.S. and overseas and the Berkley and Gulfstream acquisitions. Anadarkos proved reserves have grown 147% over the past three years, primarily as a result of the RME merger in 2000, the Berkley and Gulfstream acquisitions in 2001, successful exploration projects in Alaska, Algeria and the Gulf of Mexico, and successful development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore. The Companys proved natural gas reserves at year end 2001 were 7.04 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) compared to 6.09 Tcf at year end 2000 and 2.51 Tcf at year end 1999. Anadarkos proved gas reserves have increased 166% since year end 1998, reflecting the RME merger in 2000 and the Berkley and Gulfstream acquisitions in 2001, continued development activity onshore in the U.S. and other producing property acquisitions. Anadarkos crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves at year end 2001 increased 8% to 1.13 billion barrels compared to 1.05 billion barrels at year end 2000 and 573 MMBbls at year end 1999. Crude oil reserves have risen by 129% over the last three years primarily due to the RME merger in 2000, the Berkley and Gulfstream 41 acquisitions in 2001 and large discoveries in Alaska, Algeria and the Gulf of Mexico. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves comprise 49% of the Companys proved reserves at year end 2001 compared to 51% at year end 2000 and 58% at year end 1999. At December 31, 2001, the present value (discounted at 10%) of future net revenues from Anadarkos proved reserves was $11.5 billion, before income taxes, and was $8.0 billion, after income taxes, (stated in accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The after income taxes decrease of $13.4 billion or 62% in 2001 compared to 2000 is primarily due to significantly lower natural gas and crude oil prices at year end 2001, partially offset by additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling worldwide and the Berkley and Gulfstream acquisitions. See Critical Accounting Policies under Item 7 and Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities Unaudited in the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarkos proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES The Companys strategy includes an active asset acquisition and divestiture program. In 2001, the Company acquired approximately 157 MMBOE of proved reserves, located in: Canada, primarily from the Berkley acquisition (99 MMBOE), Qatar and Oman with the Gulfstream acquisition (57 MMBOE) and the United States (1 MMBOE). In 2000, Anadarko acquired with the RME merger approximately 912 MMBOE of proved reserves, located primarily in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Excluding the RME, Berkley and Gulfstream acquisition transactions, during 1999 2001, Anadarko acquired through purchases and trades 33 MMBOE of proved reserves for $118 million. During the same time period, the Company sold properties, either as a strategic exit from a certain area or asset rationalization in existing core areas, with proceeds totaling $289 million. Reserves associated with these sales and trades were 90 MMBOE. In 2002, the Company will continue to consider dispositions of certain producing properties in non core areas. PROPERTIES AND LEASES PRODUCING PROPERTIES The Company owns 9,493 net producing gas wells and 6,321 net producing oil wells worldwide. The following schedule shows the number of developed and undeveloped lease acres in which Anadarko held interests at December 31, 2001.

A portion of the undeveloped acreage in Algeria will be relinquished in the future upon finalization of Exploitation License boundaries. 42 LAND GRANT AND OTHER FEE MINERALS The Company also owns fee mineral interests on acreage totaling 10,138,000 (gross) or 9,109,000 (net) acres as of December 31, 2001. Of this amount, 7,929,000 (gross) or 7,740,000 (net) acres are within the Companys Land Grant area in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, which was granted by the federal government to a predecessor of RME in the mid 1800s. The Company holds royalty interests of varying percentages in approximately one million gross acres of the Land Grant that are subject to exploration and production agreements with third parties. The Companys fee mineral acreage is primarily undeveloped. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES* 2001 2000 1999 millions Development $1,641 $ 921 $311 Exploration 1,030 429 189 Acquisitions of producing properties 14 54 50 Gathering and other 244 80 27 Capitalized interest and exploration and development costs 387 224 103 Total $3,316 $1,708 $680 * Excludes corporate acquisitions The Companys primary focus for 2001 was to develop existing fields and find additional reserves in the Lower 48 states, the Gulf of Mexico and in Canada. Anadarkos total capital spending in 2001 was $3.3 billion, a 94% increase compared to 2000. The increase from 2000 represents a $720 million increase in development spending, a $601 million increase in exploration spending and a $287 million increase in spending primarily for general properties and capitalized interest. The development spending increase was primarily in the Lower 48 states, while the exploration spending increase was primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Lower 48 states. Anadarkos total capital spending for 2000 was $1.7 billion, a 151% increase compared to 1999. The increase from 1999 represents a $610 million increase in development spending, a $240 million increase in exploration spending and a $178 million increase in spending for capitalized interest and other costs. The increase in development spending was primarily related to the United States and Canada as a result of the RME merger, as well as an increase in Algerias construction development spending. The Company funded its capital investment programs in 2001, 2000 and 1999 primarily through cash flow, plus increases in long term debt, issuances of common stock and proceeds from property sales. Capital spending for 2002 has been initially set at $2.0 billion, which is a 40% decrease compared to 2001. The primary focus of the 2002 budget is to find additional oil and gas reserves and maintain Company wide production at current levels. Anadarko has allocated nearly $1.0 billion to worldwide development projects, primarily for fields in the Gulf of Mexico, western Canada, east and central Texas, north Louisiana, the western states and Algeria. Approximately $500 million is budgeted for exploration programs, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico, east Texas, north Louisiana, Alaska, western Canada, Congo and Australia. About 70% of the exploration budget will be for drilling. The remainder of the exploration budget will be used for seismic and lease acquisitions. See Outlook on Liquidity for a discussion of the sources of funds for capital spending. DEBT At year end 2001, Anadarkos total debt was $5.1 billion. This compares to total debt of $4.0 billion at year end 2000 and $1.4 billion at year end 1999. As a result of the RME merger, the liabilities of RME became liabilities of the Company. The increases in debt are related primarily to the RME merger in 2000 and the Berkley and Gulfstream acquisitions in 2001. In March 2001, Anadarko issued $650 million of Zero Yield Puttable Contingent Debt Securities (ZYP CODES) due 2021 to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and non U.S. persons under Regulation S. The debt securities were priced with a zero coupon, zero yield to maturity and a conversion premium of 38%. The proceeds from the debt securities were used initially to finance costs associated with the 43 acquisition of Berkley. Holders of the ZYP CODES have the right to require Anadarko to purchase all or a portion of their ZYP CODES in March 2002, 2004, 2006, 2011 or 2016, at $1,000 per ZYP CODES. In March 2002, ZYP CODES in the amount of $620 million were put to the Company for repayment and were paid in cash. In April 2001, Anadarko Finance Company, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Anadarko, issued $1.3 billion in notes as part of the Companys financial restructuring plan. This issuance was made up of $400 million of 6 3/4% Notes due 2011 and $900 million of 7 1/2% Notes due 2031. In May 2001, Anadarko Finance Company issued an additional $550 million of 6 3/4% Notes due 2011, bringing the 6 3/4% Notes to an aggregate total of $950 million. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Anadarko. The notes were issued as part of an exchange of securities for other Anadarko debt. In October 2001, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement and a 364 Day Revolving Credit Agreement. Each agreement provides for a $225 million principal amount and expires in 2004 and 2002, respectively. In October 2001, Anadarko Canada Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, entered into a 364 Day Canadian Credit Agreement. The agreement provides for a US$300 million principal amount and expires in 2002. The agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Anadarko. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $69 million outstanding under the Canadian Credit Agreement. In February 2002, the Company issued $650 million principal amount of 5 3/8% Notes due March 2007. In March 2002, the Company issued $400 million principal amount of 6 1/8% Notes due March 2012. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to reduce floating rate debt and to fund a portion of the ZYP CODES put to the Company for repayment in March 2002. PREFERRED STOCK During 2001, Anadarko repurchased $97 million of preferred stock. The resulting gain of $13 million was recorded to paid in capital. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM In July 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $1 billion in shares of Anadarko common stock. The share purchases may be made from time to time, depending on market conditions. Shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. To enhance the share repurchase program, Anadarko has sold put options to independent third parties. These put options entitle the holder to sell shares of Anadarko common stock to the Company on certain dates at specified prices. During 2001, Anadarko sold put options for the purchase of a total of 5 million shares of Anadarko common stock with a notional amount of $240 million. Put options for 1 million shares were exercised and put options for 2 million shares expired unexercised in 2001. During 2001, premiums of $15 million were received related to these put options and recorded as an increase to paid in capital. In January 2002, the Company entered into additional put options for 1 million shares of Anadarko common stock with a notional amount of $46 million and received a $3 million premium. Put options for an additional 1 million shares expired unexercised in 2002. The remaining put options for 2 million shares will expire in March and July 2002, if not exercised. The put options permit a net share settlement at the Companys option and do not result in a liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2001. The following table summarizes purchases under the stock purchase program and the effect of the related put option premiums on the repurchase price.

SYNTHETIC LEASES In November 1999, Anadarko entered into a build to suit lease arrangement for its corporate office building in The Woodlands, Texas. The development and acquisition of the property was financed by a special purpose entity (SPE) sponsored by a financial institution. The lease balance to be funded under this arrangement will not exceed $185 million. The SPE is not consolidated in the Companys financial statements and, based on the initial terms of the agreement, the Company has accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." The initial lease term is five years, with up to seven one year renewal options. Monthly lease payments are based on the London interbank borrowing rate applied against the lease balance and are expected to begin in 2002. Future minimum lease payments under this lease are included in the table above. The lease contains various covenants including covenants regarding the Companys financial condition. Default under the lease, including violation of these covenants, could require the Company to purchase the facility for a specified amount, which approximates the lessors original cost ($123 million funded as of December 31, 2001). As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. At the end of the lease term, the Company has an option to either purchase the facility for the purchase option amount of the lease balance plus any outstanding lease payments or to assist the SPE in the sale of the property. The Company has provided a residual value guarantee for any deficiency if the property is sold for less than the sale option amount ($104 million at December 31, 2001). In addition, the Company is entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the property in excess of the purchase option amount. In December 2000, the Company entered into a lease arrangement for an office building in The Woodlands, Texas. The acquisition of the property was financed by an SPE sponsored by a financial institution. The amount funded was $48 million. The SPE is not consolidated in the Companys financial statements and the Company has accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13. The initial lease term is five years. Monthly lease payments, which began in 2001, are based on the London interbank borrowing rate applied against the $48 million lease balance. Future minimum lease payments under this lease are included in the table above. The lease contains various covenants including covenants regarding the Companys financial condition. Default under the lease, including violation of these covenants, could require the Company to purchase the facility for a specified amount, which approximates the lessors original cost ($48 million). As of December 31, 2001, the Company is in compliance with these covenants. At the end of the lease term, the Company has an option to either purchase the facility for the purchase option amount of $48 million plus any outstanding lease payments or to assist the SPE in the sale of the property. The Company has provided a residual value guarantee for any deficiency if the property is sold for less than the sale option amount ($39 million at December 31, 2001). In addition, the Company is entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the property in excess of the purchase option amount. 45 If, for either of these leases, the Company determines that it is probable that the expected fair value of the property at the end of the lease term will be less than the purchase option amount, the Company will accrue the expected loss on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term. Currently, management does not believe it is probable that the fair market value of either of these properties will be less than the purchase option amount at the end of the lease term. OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES As is common in the oil and gas industry, Anadarko has various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. The amounts in the table reflect obligations and commitments that are not included in the 2002 capital budget. Following is a description of the Companys significant operating obligations and commitments related to oil and gas activities. Production Platform In December 2001, the Company signed a letter of intent with El Paso Energy Partners (EPN) under which a floating production platform for its Marco Polo discovery in Green Canyon Block 608 of the Gulf of Mexico will be installed. EPN will construct the platform and processing facilities that upon completion, expected in 2004, will be operated by Anadarko. The proposed agreement provides that Anadarko will dedicate its production from Green Canyon Block 608 and 11 other Green Canyon blocks to the processing facilities. The proposed agreement will require a monthly demand charge of slightly over $2 million for five years beginning at the time of project completion and a processing fee based upon production. Anadarko will be entitled to 25% of the net after tax cash proceeds from these facilities after payout, as defined, is attained. The letter of intent does not contain any purchase options, purchase obligations or value guarantees. The previous table does not include any amounts related to this letter of intent. Drilling and Work Commitments Anadarko has various work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The above table includes drilling and work related commitments of $163 million, comprised of $45 million in the United States, $53 million in Algeria, $37 million in Canada and $28 million in other international locations. The commitments in Algeria are related primarily to exploration and development contracts with SONATRACH, who is the beneficial owner of 5% of the Companys outstanding common stock. Sales Commitments In Canada, the Company has commitments to deliver gas and oil under fixed price contracts. The gas and oil volumes to be delivered under these contracts are as follows: COMMITMENTS BY PERIOD 2 3 4 5 LATER 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS TOTAL NATURAL GAS Volume million MMBtu 18 47 16 1 82 Price per MMBtu $2.16 $1.88 $1.70 $1.54 $1.90 CRUDE OIL Volume million barrels* 2 2 4 * Price is NYMEX West Texas Intermediate minus $8 per barrel with a floor of $14.40 per barrel and a ceiling of $17.24 per barrel for heavy oil delivered at Hardisty Terminal. GUARANTEES Anadarko is guarantor for certain obligations of its wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries, which are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In conjunction with the RME merger, the Company guaranteed all of the outstanding debt of RME and its subsidiaries, which is included in the consolidated debt of the Company. In addition, the Company is guarantor for specific financial obligations of two trona mining affiliates. The investments in these entities, which are not consolidated subsidiaries, are accounted for using the equity method. The Company has guaranteed a portion of certain Industrial Revenue Bonds, amounts due under a revolving credit agreement and letters of credit required for environmental surety bonds. The amount the Company would be obligated to pay should the affiliates default on these obligations would be up to $8 million for environmental surety bonds and $6 million in 2002 and $29 million after 2006 for debt. 46 ENRON The recent financial problems of Enron have had no material adverse effect on the Company. As of December 31, 2001, in connection with several physical and financial contracts, the Company had $10 million, net, in accounts payable to Enron North America and $1 million in accounts receivable from other Enron affiliates. All contracts have been terminated by Anadarko under the terms of the agreements, and $1 million has been charged to expense in 2001. The Company, through purchase accounting entries for the Berkley acquisition, had recorded market value liabilities on four contracts with Enron which were being amortized over the terms of the contract. Upon termination of these contracts in December 2001, the remaining liability of $12 million was no longer required and was recorded as income in 2001. For additional information on contracts and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time see Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Form 10 K and Note 5 Debt, Note 6 Financial Instruments, Note 15 Lease Commitments, Note 16 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans and Note 17 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. OUTLOOK ON LIQUIDITY Anadarkos net cash from operating activities in 2001 was $3.3 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2000 and $318 million in 1999. Commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil rose dramatically in 2000 and decreased significantly in the second half of 2001. The Companys original capital expenditure budget for 2002 has been set at $2.0 billion. Cash flow from operations will vary depending upon, among other things, actual commodity prices received throughout the year. The Company intends to adjust capital expenditures to reflect changes in its cash flow from operations. However, due to activities in progress at the beginning of 2002 and the seasonal nature of drilling activity in Alaska and Canada, the Company expects that a disproportionate amount of the 2002 capital expenditure budget will be spent in the first and second quarters of the year. As a result, it is likely that there will be an increase in debt early in the year. Failure of prices to increase later in the year, as expected, could result in increased borrowing throughout the year. Reduced fourth quarter activity in 2002 relative to 2001 could lead to higher working capital requirements and also result in additional borrowing. The Company has a three year stock buyback program to purchase up to $1 billion in shares of Anadarko common stock. Anticipated stock repurchases for 2002 are not included in the announced capital expenditure budget and could require additional borrowing. Anadarko believes that operating cash flow and existing or available credit facilities will be adequate to meet its capital and operating requirements for 2002. The Company funds its day to day operating expenses and capital expenditures from operating cash flows, supplemented as needed by short term borrowings of commercial paper, money market loans or credit facility borrowings. To facilitate such borrowings, the Company has in place $750 million in committed credit facilities, which are supplemented by various non committed credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates. It is the Companys policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may file shelf registrations in advance with the SEC. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property sales and additional borrowing, to secure other funds for additional capital expenditures and stock repurchases. At this time, Anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, through the exercise of stock options or through the Companys Employee Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan equity funded contributions. See Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business for additional information. The Companys credit agreements allow for a maximum capitalization ratio of 60% debt, exclusive of the effect of any non cash write downs. As of December 31, 2001, Anadarkos capitalization ratio was 44% debt. While there is no specific restriction on paying dividends, under the maximum debt capitalization ratio retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends at December 31, 2001. The amount of future common stock dividends will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. 47 DIVIDENDS In October 2001, the Board of Directors of Anadarko increased the quarterly dividend on the Companys common stock from 5 cents to 7.5 cents per share. In 2001, Anadarko paid $57 million in dividends to its common stockholders (5 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 7.5 cents per share in fourth quarter). In 2000, Anadarko paid $38 million in dividends to its common stockholders (5 cents per share per quarter). The dividend amount in 1999 was $25 million (5 cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in 1986. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company also paid $7 million, $11 million and $11 million, respectively, in preferred stock dividends. In 2002, the preferred stock dividends are expected to be $6 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND USE OF ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Anadarko and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company accounts for investments in affiliated companies (20% to 50% owned) using the equity method of accounting. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing financial statements, Management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the SEC. Under this method of accounting, the costs for unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and abandonment costs of oil and gas properties and mineral investments is amortized using the unit of production method. All other properties are depreciated on the straight line basis over the useful life of the assets, which ranges from three to 40 years. PROVED RESERVES Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Reserves are considered "proved" if they can be produced economically as demonstrated by either actual production or conclusive formation tests. Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the "proved" classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based. "Proved developed" oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which, by their nature, are subject to revision. The estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Companys engineers, are reviewed and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in assumptions based on, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to uneconomic conditions. COSTS EXCLUDED Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects. Anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. Any impairment is transferred to the costs to be amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been 48 established. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results or relinquishing drilling rights. Costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties. Significant properties, comprised primarily of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks, Alaska, the Land Grant and other international areas, are individually evaluated each quarter by the Companys exploration and engineering staff. Non producing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the Companys exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling individual wells. The Land Grant has been in active evaluation to determine an exploration program for this acreage. The Land Grants mineral interests (both working and royalty interests) are owned by the Company in perpetuity. All other significant properties are evaluated over a five to ten year period, depending on the lease term. Insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the United States and Canada. Non producing leases are impaired over a three to five year period based on the average lease period. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion. CAPITALIZED INTEREST SFAS No. 34, "Capitalization of Interest Costs," provides standards for the capitalization of interest costs as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets. FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 33 provides guidance for the application of SFAS No. 34 to the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under FIN No. 33, costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects, on which DD&A expense is not currently taken and on which exploration or development activities are in progress, qualify for capitalization of interest. Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the Companys weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of costs excluded. Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense. As costs excluded are transferred to the DD&A pool, the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the DD&A pool. CEILING TEST Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10. The ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis. The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of oil and gas properties. That limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. This ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related deferred income tax liability. If the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or non cash write down is required. A ceiling test impairment can give Anadarko a significant loss for a particular period; however, future DD&A expense would be reduced. Shown below is a summary of the ceiling test calculation and description of the major components. Ceiling Test Calculation Present Value of Oil and Gas Properties (PV 10) + Costs Excluded Income Taxes Ceiling Net Oil and Gas Properties and Equipment Deferred Income Tax Liability Net Investment Ceiling Net Investment Cushion (Write off) After Income Taxes Present Value of Oil and Gas Properties (PV 10) Estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs are made in accordance with SFAS No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities." The present value of oil and gas properties represents the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted using a prescribed 10% discount rate. Proved oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs that can be produced economically as demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests. These estimates, which are determined by the Companys engineers, are reviewed and revised as reservoir performance, prices and other 49 economic conditions change. Future net revenues are calculated based on estimated production volumes generally using the oil and gas prices in effect on the last day of the quarter, held flat for the life of the reserves. Future net revenues are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on quarter end cost levels, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the oil and gas prices on the last day of the quarter significantly impact the calculation of the PV 10. At year end 2001, Anadarkos ceiling tests were based on NYMEX prices of $2.74 per Mcf for natural gas and $19.78 per barrel for crude oil. The NYMEX prices are adjusted by location and quality differentials, as appropriate, to determine Anadarkos realized prices. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarkos proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Costs Excluded Costs excluded are capitalized costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects. These costs are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized through DD&A expense. Anadarko excludes all costs until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. When proved reserves are found, the decrease in costs excluded is offset by an increase in PV 10; thereby generally increasing the ceiling. When proved reserves are not found, the decrease in costs excluded is not offset by an increase in PV 10; thereby decreasing the ceiling. Income Taxes Future income taxes are based on the existing tax rates applied to the difference between the total of the present value of the future net cash flows plus costs excluded less the tax basis of the oil and gas properties. The effect of tax loss carryforwards and credits is considered in determining income taxes. Net Oil and Gas Properties and Equipment Net oil and gas properties and equipment are the capitalized costs related to oil and gas activities less the accumulated DD&A. Under the full cost method of accounting the costs for unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. The net capitalized costs are depreciated using the unit of production method. Net properties and equipment increase due to capital expenditures or acquisitions and decrease due to DD&A expense, property divestitures or ceiling test impairments. Deferred Income Tax Liability Deferred income taxes related only to oil and gas properties are included in the deferred income tax liability. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Anadarko uses derivative financial instruments for various purposes and carefully monitors the credit worthiness of each counter party. Effective January 2001, derivative financial instruments utilized to manage or reduce commodity price risk related to the Companys equity production were accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging Activities." Under this statement, all derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Realized gains/losses and option premiums are recognized in the statement of income when the underlying physical gas and oil production is sold. Accordingly, realized derivative gains/losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the underlying physical gas and oil production. Realized derivative gains/losses are reflected in the average sales price of the physical gas and oil production. Accounting for unrealized gains/losses is dependent on whether the derivative financial instruments have been designated and qualify as part of a hedging relationship. Derivative financial instruments may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values, cash flows or foreign currencies, if certain conditions are met. If the hedged exposure is to changes in fair value, the gains/losses on the derivative financial instrument, as well as the offsetting losses/gains on the hedged item, are recognized currently in earnings. Consequently, if gains/losses on the derivative financial instrument and the related hedge item do not completely offset, the difference (i.e., ineffective portion of the hedge) is recognized currently in earnings. If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gains/losses on the derivative financial instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gains/losses from the derivative financial instrument, if any, as well as any 50 amounts excluded from the assessment of the cash flow hedges effectiveness are recognized currently in other (income) expense. Effective July 2001, the Company implemented Derivatives Implementation Group Issue G20, "Cash Flow Hedges: Assessing and Measuring the Effectiveness of a Purchased Option Used in a Cash Flow Hedge," which provides guidance for assessing the effectiveness on total changes in an options cash flows rather than only on changes in the options intrinsic value. Time value changes were previously being recognized in current earnings since the Company excluded time value changes from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. If the hedged exposure is a foreign currency exposure, the accounting is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains/losses on derivative financial instruments that do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings. Derivative financial instruments, as well as physical delivery purchase and sale contracts, utilized in the Companys energy trading activities and in the management of price risk associated with the Companys firm transportation keep whole commitment (see Derivative Financial Instruments under Item 7a of this Form 10 K) are accounted for under the mark to market accounting method pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." Under this method, the derivatives and physical delivery contracts are revalued in each accounting period and premiums and unrealized gains/losses are recorded in the statement of income and carried as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Companys derivative financial instruments associated with the marketing and trading activities are generally either exchange traded or valued by reference to a commodity that is traded in a liquid market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data. Option valuations are based on the Black Scholes option pricing model and verified against third party quotations. The fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated with actively quoted natural gas basis prices. Basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the NYMEX gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices, discounted at a 10% per year. Management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors (such as expected drilling activity, anticipated pipeline construction projects, expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points, etc.) that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES SFAS No. 142 SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires discontinuing amortization of goodwill after year end 2001 and requires that goodwill be tested for impairment. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to business levels referred to as reporting units. The fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value (including goodwill) then a second test is performed to determine the amount of the impairment. If the second test is necessary, the fair value of the reporting units individual assets and liabilities is deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit. This difference represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to the book value of the reporting units goodwill. Any excess of the book value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is the amount of the impairment. The goodwill impairment test is performed annually, and also at interim dates upon the occurrence of significant events. Significant events include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold; significant adverse trends in current and future oil and gas prices; nationalization of any of the Companys oil and gas properties; or, significant increases in a reporting units carrying value relative to its fair value. The initial goodwill impairment test is required to be performed using an effective date of January 1, 2002. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting SFAS No. 142. Anadarko does not expect any initial goodwill impairment. 51 SFAS No. 143 SFAS No. 143, "Accounting of Asset Retirement Obligations," requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and will be effective for the Company in January 2003. The Company is evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 143. SFAS No. 144 SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. SFAS No. 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 as of January 2002 had no impact on the Companys financial statements. For additional information on the Companys accounting policies see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. REGULATORY MATTERS AND ADDITIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING BUSINESS The Company has made in this report, and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning the Companys operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and gas properties, and those statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "estimates," "projects," "target," "goal," "plans," "objective," "should" or similar expressions or variations on such expressions. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10 K and in the Companys other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. COMMODITY PRICING AND DEMAND Crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide, pricing decisions and production quotas of OPEC and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets. Natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile. In periods of sharply lower commodity prices, the Company may curtail production and capital spending projects, as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows. Changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the Companys determination of proved reserves and the Companys calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves. In addition, demand for oil and gas in the U.S. and worldwide may affect the Companys level of production. Under the full cost method of accounting, a non cash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the Companys oil and gas properties on a country by country basis may be required when prices are low. Whether the Company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter, as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter. While this non cash charge can give Anadarko a significant reported loss for the period, future expenses for DD&A will be reduced. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY The Companys oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the release of emissions into the atmosphere, the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials, offshore oil and gas operations, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, these laws and 52 regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the Companys failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the Companys operations. Anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the Companys operations or financial condition in the past. However, because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the Companys operations or financial condition. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the Company is involved, see Note 17 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. EXPLORATION AND OPERATING RISKS The Companys business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons. As protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, the Company maintains insurance coverage, including certain physical damage, employers liability, comprehensive general liability and workers compensation insurance. Although Anadarko is not fully insured against all risks in its business, the Company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations. The occurrence of a significant event against which the Company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position. DEVELOPMENT RISKS The Company is involved in several large development projects. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include: project approvals by joint venture partners; timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies; manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment; and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons. In large development projects, these uncertainties are usually resolved, but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may, therefore, affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects. DOMESTIC GOVERNMENTAL RISKS The domestic operations of the Company have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations. FOREIGN OPERATIONS RISK The Companys operations in areas outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include, among other things, loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, insurrection and other political risks, increases in taxes and governmental royalties, renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the Companys international operations. The Companys international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation. To date, the Companys international operations have not been materially affected by these risks. COMPETITION The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. The Companys competitors include the major oil companies, independent oil and gas concerns, individual producers, gas marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers. OTHER Regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells, regulate well spacing, prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters. Operations conducted by the Company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes. Additionally, certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management and the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In addition to the standard permit process, 53 federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS General The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. The Company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims, including numerous claims by employees of third party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos and benzene while working at a refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, which the Company sold in segments in 1987 and 1989. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company, although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved. For a description of certain legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10 K. 54 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Anadarkos derivative commodity instruments currently are comprised of futures, swaps and options contracts. The volume of derivative commodity instruments utilized by the Company to hedge its market price risk and in its energy trading operation can vary during the year within the boundaries of its established policy guidelines. See Critical Accounting Policies and Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business under Item 7 and Note 1 Summary of Accounting Policies and Note 6 Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The majority of the derivatives into which the Company enters have terms of less than 12 months. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had a net unrealized gain of $7 million before taxes (gains of $9 million and losses of $2 million), or $4 million after taxes, on derivative commodity instruments entered into to hedge equity production recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Other income for 2001, included $18 million of net gains related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. These gains were primarily due to the change in the time value of the option contracts that was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a 10% increase in commodity prices, the potential additional loss on these derivative commodity instruments would be approximately $9 million. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had the following volumes under derivative contracts related to its oil and gas producing activities(non trading activity): DECEMBER 31, 2001 NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) QUALIFIES FOR PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE* (MILLION MMBTU) ($ PER MMBTU) MILLIONS HEDGE ACCOUNTING NATURAL GAS 2002 2 way collar 2.3 3.00 5.00 $ 1 yes 2002 3 way collar 6.8 2.20 3.00 4.83 2 yes 2003 2 way collar 2.3 3.00 5.00 1 yes 2003 3 way collar 6.8 2.20 3.00 4.83 1 yes 2004 2 way collar 2.3 3.00 5.00 1 yes 2004 3 way collar 6.9 2.20 3.00 4.83 1 yes 2005 2 way collar 2.3 3.00 5.00 1 yes 2005 3 way collar 6.8 2.20 3.00 4.83 1 yes 2002 Calls sold 10.1 3.66 2 no 2002 Calls purchased 4.9 3.50 no 2003 Calls sold 7.4 3.18 (2) no 2003 Calls purchased 10.2 4.12 2 no 2004 Calls sold 0.7 2.95 no 2004 Calls purchased 0.7 2.95 no Total $11 NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) QUALIFIES FOR PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE* (MMBBLS) ($ PER BARREL) MILLIONS HEDGE ACCOUNTING CRUDE OIL 2002 Swaps 0.4 25.56 $ 2 yes 2002 3 way collar 3.3 19.11 23.33 30.51 6 yes Total $ 8 55 DECEMBER 31, 2000 NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) QUALIFIES FOR PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE* (MILLION MMBTU) ($ PER MMBTU) MILLIONS HEDGE ACCOUNTING NATURAL GAS 2001 Swaps 1.1 6.57 $ 10 yes 2001 2 way collar 74.7 4.14 9.24 (16) yes 2001 3 way collar 5.2 2.20 3.00 4.83 yes 2002 2 way collar 2.3 3.00 5.00 (1) yes 2002 3 way collar 6.8 2.20 3.00 4.83 (3) yes 2003 2 way collar 2.3 3.00 5.00 (1) yes 2003 3 way collar 6.8 2.20 3.00 4.83 (3) yes 2004 2 way collar 2.3 3.00 5.00 yes 2004 3 way collar 6.9 2.20 3.00 4.83 (1) yes 2005 2 way collar 2.3 3.00 5.00 yes 2005 3 way collar 6.8 2.20 3.00 4.83 (1) yes 2001 Calls sold 7.0 11.71 (3) no 2001 Calls sold 48.6 3.30 (133) no 2001 Calls purchased 49.5 3.31 136 no 2001 Puts sold 20.9 2.64 no Total $ (16) NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) QUALIFIES FOR PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE* (MMBBLS) ($ PER BARREL) MILLIONS HEDGE ACCOUNTING CRUDE OIL 2001 2 way collar 4.3 19.32 23.77 $(11) yes 2001 3 way collar 6.6 18.03 21.00 25.98 (10) yes 2001 Puts sold 1.8 20.95 1 no 2001 Puts purchased 1.9 18.03 (5) no Total $(25) MMBtu million British thermal units MMBbls million barrels * A "2 way collar" is a combination of options, a sold call and purchased put.

The purchased put and sold put establish a floating minimum price (the "floating floor") and the sold call establishes a maximum price (the "ceiling") the Company will receive for the volumes under contract. Derivative financial instruments utilized in the Companys energy trading activities and in the management of price risk associated with the Companys firm transportation keep whole commitment are accounted for under the mark to market accounting method pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities". Under this method, the derivatives and physical delivery purchase and sale contracts are revalued in each accounting period and premiums and unrealized gains/losses are immediately recorded in the statement of income and carried as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Anadarkos energy marketing and trading business is backed by the Companys substantial oil and gas production and reserves. In the United States and Canada, the Company purchases natural gas produced by other companies in those areas where the Company has substantial production volumes. Third party purchases allow the Company to aggregate larger volumes of gas and attract larger, more creditworthy customers, which in turn spreads the Companys relatively fixed overhead costs over 56 more gas and can help reduce transportation costs. The Company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities. The marketing and trading businesss risk position, most of the time, is a net short position. Excluding the firm transportation keep whole agreement, essentially all of the Companys trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months. The keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contracts expiration date or February 2009. The derivative contracts entered into for trading purposes are typically for terms of less than 12 months. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had a net unrealized loss of $49 million (gains of $42 million and losses of $91 million) on derivative commodity instruments entered into for trading purposes. Losses on derivative commodity instruments are offset by a net unrealized gain of $66 million (gains of $82 million and losses of $16 million) on physical contracts entered into for trading purposes. Based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a 10% increase in underlying commodity prices, the potential loss on the derivative instruments would be decreased by approximately $4 million. The energy trading derivative contracts are primarily used to neutralize fixed price exposure in physical delivery agreements and to generate profit on or from exposure to changes in the market price of crude oil and natural gas. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had the following volumes under derivative contracts related to its trading activity: DECEMBER 31, 2001 NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE (MILLION MMBTU) ($ PER MMBTU) MILLIONS NATURAL GAS 2002 Futures sold 23.8 3.34 $ 18 2002 Futures purchased 22.3 3.50 (21) 2002 Swaps 72.3 3.20 (42) 2002 Calls sold 8.5 3.07 1 2002 Calls purchased 12.8 4.09 1 2002 Puts sold 8.3 3.25 (7) 2002 Puts purchased 0.8 2.58 2003 Futures sold 1.2 3.51 2003 Futures purchased 0.3 3.36 2003 Swaps 12.2 3.12 Total $(50) NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE (MMBBLS) ($ PER BARREL) MILLIONS CRUDE OIL 2002 Futures sold 2.8 19.80 $ (1) 2002 Futures purchased 1.5 20.05 2 2002 Swaps 0.5 21.77 2002 Calls sold 0.4 29.50 Total $ 1 57 DECEMBER 31, 2000 NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE (MILLION MMBTU) ($ PER MMBTU) MILLIONS NATURAL GAS 2001 Futures sold 9.6 6.48 $(32) 2001 Futures purchased 9.0 7.82 19 2001 Swaps 23.0 5.31 77 2001 Calls sold 1.4 7.67 (2) 2001 Calls purchased 2.0 6.56 4 2001 Puts sold 3.2 7.93 (1) 2002 Swaps 0.5 2.08 (1) Total $ 64 NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE (MMBBLS) ($ PER BARREL) MILLIONS CRUDE OIL 2001 Futures sold 1.8 27.40 $ 5 2001 Futures purchased 1.5 27.94 (5) Total $ RME was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported their gas marketing program within the gathering, processing and marketing (GPM) business segment, which was sold in 1999 to Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. (Duke). Most of the GPMs firm long term transportation contracts were transferred to Duke in the GPM disposition. One contract was retained, but is managed and operated by Duke. Anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the Companys natural gas. As part of the GPM disposition, RME agreed to pay Duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates, while Duke will pay RME if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates (keep whole agreement). Net payments from Duke for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $161 million. Transportation contracts transferred to Duke in the GPM disposition and the contract not transferred, all of which are included in the keep whole agreement with Duke, relate to various pipelines. This keep whole agreement is accounted for on a mark to market basis. This keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contracts expiration date or February 2009. During 2001, the Company recognized other income of $91 million ($26 million from the agreement and $65 million from derivative financial instruments). As of December 31, 2001, other current liabilities included $27 million and other long term liabilities included $80 million related to this agreement. The future gain or loss from this agreement cannot be accurately predicted. Anticipated discounted and undiscounted liabilities for the firm transportation keep whole commitment at December 31, 2001 are as follows: MILLIONS UNDISCOUNTED DISCOUNTED 2002 $ 27 $ 27 2003 21 18 2004 27 22 2005 20 15 2006 19 12 Later years 23 13 Total $137 $107 58 The Company may periodically use derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure under the keep whole agreement to potential decreases in future transportation market values. While the derivatives are intended to reduce the Companys exposure to declines in transportation market rates, they also limit the potential to benefit from market price increases. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized other income of $64 million on derivative financial instruments related to transportation rates. At December 31, 2001, other current assets included $25 million of unrealized gains related to this agreement. An analysis of these derivative financial instruments determined that an adverse price movement would not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. Due to decreased liquidity, the use of derivative financial instruments to manage this risk is generally limited to the forward twelve months only. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had the following volumes under derivative contracts related to the firm transportation keep whole agreement: DECEMBER 31, 2001 NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE (MILLION MMBTU)* ($ PER MMBTU) MILLIONS NATURAL GAS 2002 Swaps 4.2 8.42 $25 DECEMBER 31, 2000 NET FAIR VALUE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AVERAGE PRICE ASSET (LIABILITY) PERIOD INSTRUMENT TYPE (MILLION MMBTU)** ($ PER MMBTU) MILLIONS NATURAL GAS 2001 Swaps 13.4 9.08 $12 2001 Calls sold 0.9 9.84 Total $12 * Represents 2% of the Companys total volumetric exposure under the keep whole agreement for 2002. ** Represents 6% of the Companys total volumetric exposure under the keep whole agreement for 2001. For additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio and the firm transportation keep whole agreement see Marketing Strategies under Item 7 of this Form 10 K. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM In July 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $1 billion in shares of Anadarko common stock. The share purchases may be made from time to time, depending on market conditions. Shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. During 2001, the Company purchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $116 million. In January 2002, the Company purchased an additional 1 million shares of common stock for $50 million. To enhance the share repurchase program, Anadarko has sold put options to independent third parties. These put options entitle the holder to sell shares of Anadarko common stock to the Company on certain dates at specified prices. During 2001, Anadarko sold put options for the purchase of a total of 5 million shares of Anadarko common stock with a notional amount of $240 million. Put options for 1 million shares were exercised, and put options for 2 million shares expired unexercised in 2001. During 2001, premiums of $15 million were received related to these put options and recorded as an increase to paid in capital. In January 2002, the Company entered into additional put options for 1 million shares of Anadarko common stock with a notional amount of $46 million and received a $3 million premium. Put options for an additional 1 million shares expired unexercised in 2002. The remaining put options for 2 million shares will expire in March and July 2002, if not exercised. The put options permit a net share settlement at the Companys option and do not result in a liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2001. 59 INTEREST RATE RISK Anadarko is also exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of the Companys variable and fixed interest rate debt. The Company believes the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of the Companys various debt instruments is not material. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Companys Canadian subsidiaries use the Canadian dollar as their functional currency. The Companys other international subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. In addition, in these subsidiaries, certain asset and liability balances are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency. These asset and liability balances are remeasured in the preparation of the subsidiarys financial statements using a combination of current and historical exchange rates, with any resulting remeasurement adjustments included in net income during the period. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, a Canadian subsidiary had $187 million and $650 million, respectively, outstanding of fixed rate notes and debentures denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized $25 million and $8 million, respectively, of non cash losses before taxes associated with the remeasurement of this debt. The potential foreign currency remeasurement impact on earnings from a 10% change in the December 31, 2001 Canadian exchange rate would be about $20 million based on the outstanding debt at December 31, 2001. The Company periodically enters into foreign currency contracts to hedge specific currency exposures from commercial transactions. As a result of the RME merger transaction, the Company acquired foreign currency forward exchange contracts with maturities through October 2004 and recorded a $4 million deferred liability representing the fair value of these contracts. These contracts were determined to be cash flow hedges of Anadarko Canadas future U.S. dollar denominated hydrocarbon sales. This deferred liability will be recognized in earnings when the contracts are settled. The unrealized loss on foreign currency contracts excluding the $4 million unamortized deferred liability at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $6 million and $2 million, respectively. Approximately $3 million of the after tax unrealized loss was included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2001. No portion of the balance is expected to be reclassified into earnings during 2002. The following table summarizes the Companys open foreign currency positions at December 31, 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 $ in millions, except foreign currency rates Notional amount US$ $ 70 $ 70 Forward rate 1.36 1.36 Market rate 1.58 1.48 Decrease in rate (0.22) (0.12) Fair value loss C$ $ 15 $ 8 Fair value loss US$ $ 10 $ 6 At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Companys Latin American subsidiaries had foreign deferred tax liabilities denominated in the local currency equivalent totaling $78 million and $98 million, respectively. During 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized tax benefits associated with remeasurement of these deferred tax liabilities of $6 million and $9 million, respectively. In conjunction with the sale of Latin American properties in 2001, the Company indemnified a purchaser for the use of local tax losses denominated in the local currency equivalent totaling $22 million. A gain of $1 million, before taxes, was recognized related to the remeasurement of this liability and is included in other (income) expense for the year ended December 31, 2001. The potential foreign currency remeasurement impact on net earnings from a 10% change in the year end Latin American exchange rates would be approximately $9 million. COMMODITY PRICE RISK As a result of low natural gas and oil prices at September 30, 2001, Anadarkos capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in the United States, Canada and Argentina exceeded the ceiling limitation and the Company recorded a $2.53 billion ($1.57 billion after taxes) non cash write down in the third quarter of 2001. The pre tax write down is reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.
