Net loss for 2001 includes non cash charges of $2.5 billion ($1.6 billion after taxes) for impairments of the carrying value of oil and gas properties primarily in the United States, Canada and Argentina as a result of low natural gas and oil prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001. See Critical Accounting Policies. Anadarko had net income available to common stockholders in 2000 of $796 million or $4.16 per share (diluted). In January 2002, the Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." See Note 3 Goodwill in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. REVENUES 2002 2001 2000 millions Gas sales $1,835 $2,952 $1,615 Oil and condensate sales 1,690 1,397 946 Natural gas liquids sales 222 256 264 Other sales 113 113 86 Total $3,860 $4,718 $2,911 During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." In accordance with EITF Issue No. 02 3, marketing sales and purchases resulting in physical settlement for prior periods have been reclassified to show net marketing margins as revenues. The marketing margins related to the Companys equity production are included in gas sales, oil and condensate sales and natural gas liquids (NGLs) sales and are reflected in commodity prices. The marketing margin related to purchases of third party commodities is included in other sales. This reclassification had no effect on reported net income or cash flow. 28 Anadarkos total revenues for 2002 were down $858 million or 18% compared to total revenues in 2001 due primarily to a significant decrease in natural gas prices, as well as decreases in natural gas volumes, partially offset by higher crude oil prices and volumes. Total revenues for 2001 increased $1.8 billion or 62% compared to 2000 due primarily to a significant increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in crude oil, condensate and NGLs prices.

The decrease in volumes for 2002 was primarily due to a decrease of 14 MMBOE due to operations in the United States, primarily offshore, and in Texas and Louisiana, and a decrease of 4 MMBOE related to the disposition of operations in Guatemala and Argentina in 2001. The decrease in volumes in the United States was primarily a result of natural production declines and a decrease in development drilling in late 2001 and early 2002 in response to lower commodity prices. These decreases were offset by an increase of 16 MMBOE in Algeria due to the expansion of production facilities. The Companys sales volumes were up 87 MMBOE or 78% in 2001 compared to 112 MMBOE in 2000. Approximately 70% of the increase in volumes during 2001 was due to a full year of operations in 2001 from properties acquired with the Anadarko Holding Company (Anadarko Holding) merger transaction in July 2000, compared to 5 1/2 months of operations in 2000. The remainder of the increase in volumes during 2001 was due primarily to increases of approximately 13 MMBOE from operations in the Gulf of Mexico, 7 MMBOE related to the acquisition of Berkley Petroleum Corp. (Berkley) in March 2001, 6 MMBOE from operations in the Bossier play in Texas and Louisiana and 5 MMBOE from operations in Alaska. Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future.

The decrease in volumes was due primarily to a decrease of 66 Bcf from operations within the United States, primarily offshore and in Texas, partially offset by an increase of 14 Bcf from operations in Canada primarily due to the Berkley acquisition in 2001. The Companys natural gas sales volumes for 2001 were up 310 Bcf or 81% compared to 2000. Approximately 70% of the increase in natural gas volumes during 2001 was due to a full year of production in 2001 from properties acquired with the Anadarko Holding merger transaction compared to 5 1/2 months of production in 2000. The remainder of the increase in volumes during 2001 was due primarily to increases of approximately 44 Bcf from operations in the Gulf of Mexico, 34 Bcf from the Bossier play in Texas and Louisiana and 29 Bcf related to the acquisition of Berkley in March 2001. Production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand. However, the Company may decide during periods of low commodity prices to decrease development activity, which can result in decreased production volumes. The Companys average natural gas price in 2002 decreased 33% compared to 2001. The decrease in prices during 2002 were attributed to a severe decline in natural gas demand as a result of high prices in early 2001, followed by a national economic downturn and mild summer weather in 2001. The Companys average natural gas price in 2001 was essentially flat compared to 2000. The higher natural gas prices realized in the first half of 2001 were offset by a decrease in natural gas prices in the second half of 2001. As of the end of January 2003, the Company had hedged 38% and 22% of the Companys natural gas production that is expected to be produced during 2003 and 2004, respectively. As a result, the remaining future natural gas volumes are subject to continued volatility based on fluctuations in market prices.

The increase was due primarily to an increase of approximately 16 MMBbls from operations in Algeria primarily due to the expansion of production facilities and an increase of 2 MMBbls due to the acquisition of producing properties in Qatar in 2001. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 4 MMBbls related primarily to the sale of producing properties in Guatemala and Argentina in 2001, a decrease of 3 MMBbls related to operations in the United States, primarily offshore, and a decrease of 3 MMBbls related to operations in Venezuela primarily due to higher oil prices. See Critical Accounting Policies. 31 Crude oil and condensate sales volumes in 2001 increased 32 MMBbls or 89% compared to 2000. Approximately 65% of the increase in sales volumes during 2001 was due to a full year of operations in 2001 from properties acquired with the Anadarko Holding merger transaction compared to 5 1/2 months of operations in 2000. The remainder of the increase in crude oil and condensate sales volumes during 2001 was due primarily to increases of approximately 6 MMBbls from operations in the Gulf of Mexico, 5 MMBbls in Alaska and 2 MMBbls related to the acquisition of Berkley in March 2001. Production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices. The Companys average realized crude oil price in 2002 increased 10% compared to 2001. The increase in crude oil prices in 2002 was due primarily to continued uncertainty of the situation in the middle east, the oil workers strike in Venezuela and a colder than normal winter late in 2002 which increased oil demand in the United States. Anadarkos average realized crude oil prices for 2001 decreased 22% compared to 2000. The decrease in crude oil prices during 2001 is attributed primarily to a modest increase in supply and very slow growth in demand due to a worldwide economic downturn and a sharp decline in jet fuel consumption. As of the end of January 2003, the Company had hedged 35% and 3% of the Companys crude oil production that is expected to be produced during 2003 and 2004, respectively. As a result, the remaining future oil and condensate volumes are subject to continued volatility based on fluctuations in market prices.

NGLs sales volumes in 2001 increased 25% compared to 2000 primarily due to the increase in natural gas sales volumes. The 2002 average NGLs prices decreased 11% compared to 2001. High levels of NGLs inventories in the United States during the first half of 2002, coupled with lower demand for NGLs by the petrochemical industry, have caused NGLs prices to decline. The 2001 average NGLs prices decreased 24% compared to 2000 due primarily to a decrease in demand. NGLs production is dependent on natural gas prices and the economics of processing the natural gas volumes to extract NGLs. 32 COSTS AND EXPENSES 2002 2001 2000 millions Operating expenses $ 747 $ 769 $ 487 Administrative and general 314 292 270 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,121 1,154 593 Other taxes 214 247 128 Impairments related to oil and gas properties 39 2,546 50 Amortization of goodwill 73 31 Total $2,435 $5,081 $1,559 During 2002, Anadarkos costs and expenses decreased $2.6 billion or 52% compared to 2001 due to the following factors: Operating expenses decreased $22 million (3%) primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with processing NGLs. Administrative and general expenses increased $22 million (8%). An increase of $58 million due primarily to increases in benefits and salaries expenses associated with the Companys growing workforce was partially offset by a $31 million decrease in merger related expenses and a $5 million decrease related to an adjustment to provisions for doubtful accounts. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense decreased $33 million (3%). The decrease is due primarily to a lower DD&A rate for oil and gas properties in 2002 as a result of ceiling test impairments in the third quarter of 2001 and a decrease related to slightly lower production volumes in 2002. Other taxes decreased $33 million (13%). The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in production taxes as a result of lower commodity prices and slightly lower production volumes in 2002. Impairments in 2002 relate primarily to oil and gas properties in Congo ($16 million), Oman ($10 million), Australia ($7 million) and Tunisia ($5 million) primarily due to unsuccessful exploration activities. Amortization of goodwill was discontinued in 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142. During 2001, Anadarkos costs and expenses increased $3.5 billion or 226% compared to 2000 due to the following factors: Operating expenses increased $282 million (58%) primarily due to a significant increase in the number of producing wells as a result of mergers and acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 and significant development activity in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and the Bossier play in east Texas and Louisiana. Operating expenses were also impacted by an increase in oil field service costs. Administrative and general expenses increased $22 million (8%). An increase of $67 million due primarily to the Companys expanded workforce resulting from the Anadarko Holding merger transaction in mid 2000 and higher costs associated with the Companys growing workforce was partially offset by a decrease in provisions for doubtful accounts of $23 million and a $22 million decrease in merger related expenses. DD&A expense increased $561 million (95%). About 80% of the increase was due to the increase in volumes as a result of mergers and acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 and significant development activity. The remaining increase is due to increases in the DD&A rate, which is also due to the merger and acquisitions. Other taxes increased $119 million (93%). Approximately 50% of the increase was due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of the significant increase in properties as a result of the merger and acquisitions. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to an increase in production taxes as a result of the increase in volumes. Impairments in 2001 were due to low oil and gas prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001, which resulted in ceiling test impairments for the United States ($1.7 billion), Canada ($808 million), Argentina ($15 million) and Brazil ($4 million), as well as unsuccessful exploration activities in the United Kingdom ($11 million) and Ghana ($7 million). Amortization of goodwill increased $42 million due to the Anadarko Holding merger transaction in mid 2000 ($32 million) and the Berkley acquisition in 2001 ($10 million). 33 INTEREST EXPENSE 2002 2001 2000 millions Gross interest expense $ 358 $ 301 $ 193 Capitalized interest (155) (209) (100) Net interest expense $ 203 $ 92 $ 93 Anadarkos gross interest expense has increased over the past three years due primarily to the Anadarko Holding merger transaction in mid 2000 and the Berkley acquisition in 2001 as well as higher levels of borrowings for capital expenditures, including producing property acquisitions. Gross interest expense in 2002 increased 19% compared to 2001 primarily due to higher average debt outstanding in 2002 primarily because of acquisitions in 2001 and slightly higher interest rates. Gross interest expense in 2001 increased 56% compared to 2000 primarily due to the Anadarko Holding merger transaction in mid 2000 and the Berkley acquisition in 2001 which resulted in higher average borrowings during 2001. See Capital Resources and Liquidity and Outlook on Liquidity. In 2002, capitalized interest decreased by 26% compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in capitalized costs that qualify for interest capitalization. In 2001, capitalized interest increased by 109% compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in costs that qualify for interest capitalization related to the Anadarko Holding merger transaction in mid 2000 and the Berkley acquisition in 2001. For additional information about the Companys policies regarding costs excluded and capitalized interest see Critical Accounting Policies Costs Excluded and Capitalized Interest.

Other income in 2001 decreased $102 million compared to the same period of 2000 due primarily to an $84 million decrease related to the effect of significantly lower market value for firm transportation subject to a keep whole agreement and a $22 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses primarily due to changes in the Canadian exchange rates. See Derivative Instruments and Foreign Currency Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10 K. INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) 2002 2001 2000 millions Income tax expense (benefit) $376 $(214) $602 For 2002, income taxes increased $590 million compared to 2001. Income taxes for 2001 decreased $816 million compared to 2000. Income taxes for 2001 include a benefit of approximately $962 million related to the impairment of the carrying value of oil and gas properties in the United States, Canada and Argentina as a result of low natural gas and crude oil prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001. Excluding the effect of the impairment and related tax benefit in 2001, income taxes for 2002 decreased primarily due to the decrease in earnings before income taxes. Excluding the effect of the impairment and the 34 related tax benefit in 2001, the increase in 2001 income taxes compared to 2000 was primarily due to the increase in earnings before income taxes. The effective tax rate for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was 31%, 55% and 42%, respectively. The variances in the effective tax rate for 2002 and 2000 from the statutory rate of 35% were due primarily to changes in income taxes related to foreign operations. The effective tax rate for 2001 was 35%, excluding the effect of the impairment and the related tax benefit. MARKETING STRATEGIES OVERVIEW The Companys sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale. Therefore, even though the Company sells significant volumes to major purchasers, the Company believes other purchasers would be willing to buy the Companys natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs at comparable market prices. The Companys marketing department actively manages sales of its oil and gas through Anadarko Energy Services Company (AES), Anadarko, Anadarko Canada Corporation and Anadarko Holding. The Company markets its production to customers at competitive prices, maximizing realized prices while managing credit exposure. The market knowledge gained through the marketing effort is valuable to the corporate decision making process. The Company also conducts trading activities for the purpose of generating profits on or from exposure to changes in market prices of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs. However, the Company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities. The Companys trading risk position, typically, is a net short position that is offset by the Companys natural long position as a producer. The Companys marketing function does not engage in round trip trades or participate in any marketing related partnerships. Essentially all of the Companys trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months. See Derivative Instruments under Item 7a of this Form 10 K. During 2002, all segments of the natural gas market experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition, liquidity and credit. This has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies. In 2002, Anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third party gas purchasers; however, in certain situations the Company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit. NATURAL GAS The North American natural gas market has grown significantly throughout the last 10 years and management believes continued growth to be likely. Natural gas prices have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be so. Management believes the Companys portfolio of exploration and development prospects should position Anadarko to continue to participate in this growth. AES is a full service marketing company offering supply assurance, competitive pricing, risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs. Approximately 40% of the Companys gas production was sold through AES in 2002. The Company also purchases some physical volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near Anadarkos production. These purchases allow the Company to aggregate larger volumes of gas and attract larger, creditworthy customers, which in turn enhances the value of the Companys production. The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the "daily" gas market to take advantage of any price volatility. Included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative instruments. Anadarko Holding was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported the gas marketing program within the gathering, processing and marketing (GPM) business segment, which was sold in 1999 to Duke Energy (Duke). Most of the GPMs firm long term transportation contracts were transferred to Duke in the GPM disposition. One contract was retained, but is managed and operated by Duke. Anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the Companys natural gas. As part of the GPM disposition, Anadarko Holding agreed to pay Duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates, while Duke will pay Anadarko Holding if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates (keep whole agreement). The fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated with actively quoted natural gas basis prices. Basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the 35 New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices, discounted at 10% per year. Management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors (such as expected drilling activity, anticipated pipeline construction projects, expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points) that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, approximately 29%, 31% and 56%, respectively, of the Companys gas production was sold under long term contracts to Duke. These sales represent 13%, 21% and 24%, respectively, of total revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Most of the Companys gas production sold to Duke is under a single agreement that expires at the end of the first quarter of 2004. Volumes sold to Duke under this contract may be delivered at a number of locations generally at the tailgate of processing facilities owned or operated by Duke or its affiliates and typically in the general vicinity of the fields where produced. The pricing of gas under this contract is market based and therefore varies monthly and by region. CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE AND NGLS Anadarkos crude oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Canada, Algeria and other international areas. Most of the Companys U.S. crude oil and NGLs production is sold under 30 day "evergreen" contracts with prices based on marketing indices and adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Most of the Companys Canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater. Oil from Algeria is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel. AES purchases and sells third party crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Companys domestic and international market areas. Included in this strategy is the use of various derivative instruments. GAS GATHERING SYSTEMS AND PROCESSING Anadarkos investment in gas gathering operations allows the Company to better manage its gas production, improve ultimate recovery of reserves, enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities. The Company has invested $162 million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years. The vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from Anadarko operated wells. The Company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction and sale of NGLs in efficient plants with flexible commitments. Anadarko also processes gas and has interests in one operated plant and three non operated plants. Anadarkos strategy to aggregate gas through Company owned and third party gathering systems allows Anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the Company has significant production. MARKETING CONTRACTS The following schedules provide additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio of physical and derivative contracts and the firm transportation keep whole agreement and related derivatives as of December 31, 2002. The Company records income or loss on these activities using the mark to market method. See Critical Accounting Policies for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives are calculated.

This compares to 1,420 gross wells (970 gas wells, 375 oil wells and 75 dry holes) in 2001 and 709 gross wells (385 gas wells, 269 oil wells and 55 dry holes) in 2000. The decrease in activity during 2002 reflects the Companys reduced spending for development drilling in response to lower commodity prices in late 2001 and early 2002. The increase in activity during 2001 was a result of mergers and acquisitions in 2001 and 2000 and improved commodity prices at the beginning of 2001. The Companys 2002 exploration and development drilling program is discussed in Oil and Gas Properties and Activities under Item 1 of this Form 10 K.

Reserve replacement is the key to growth, and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves, among other factors. For the 21st consecutive year, Anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs, stated on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis. During 2002, Anadarkos worldwide reserve replacement was 112% of total production of 196 MMBOE. The Companys worldwide reserve replacement in 2001 was 221% of total production of 201 MMBOE. The Companys worldwide reserve replacement in 2000 was 1,059% of total production of 112 MMBOE. Over the last five years, the Companys annual reserve replacement has averaged 368% of annual production volumes. Excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, Anadarkos worldwide reserve replacement for 2002 was 87% of total production compared to 173% for 2001 and 231% for 2000. The decrease in 2002 was partially due to a downward price revision of 36 MMBOE in Venezuela. See Critical Accounting Policies. Excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, the Companys annual worldwide reserve replacement over the past five years averaged 187% of annual production volumes. Anadarko continues to increase its energy reserves in the U.S. In 2002, the Company replaced 185% of its U.S. production volumes with U.S. reserves. This compares to a U.S. reserve replacement of 161% in 2001 and 855% in 2000. The Companys U.S. reserve replacement for the five year period 1998 2002 was 325% of production. Excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, Anadarkos U.S. reserve replacement for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was 137%, 160% and 207%, respectively, of total production. The Companys U.S. reserve replacement for the five year period 1998 2002 was 179% excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. By comparison, the most recent published U.S. industry average (1997 2001) was 111% (Source: U.S. Department of Energy). Anadarkos U.S. reserve replacement performance for the same period of 1997 2001 was 360% of production or 195% of production, excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. Industry data for 2002 are not yet available. COST OF FINDING Cost of finding represents the cost of proved reserves added during a specific period through all means, including all costs and reserve additions related to extensions and discoveries, revisions, improved recovery and purchases of proved reserves. Cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development. A better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period. For the period 1998 2002, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost was $7.24 per BOE. The Companys U.S. finding cost for the same five year period was $7.78 per BOE. Excluding mergers and acquisitions, Anadarkos worldwide and U.S. finding costs for the five year period 1998 2002 were $7.23 per BOE and $7.44 per BOE, respectively. For the five year period 1997 2001, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost was $6.66 per BOE and its U.S. finding cost was $7.58 per BOE. For the five year period 1997 2001, the Companys worldwide and U.S. finding costs excluding mergers and acquisitions were $5.88 per BOE and $6.78 per BOE, respectively. For 2002, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost was $10.52 per BOE. This compares to $8.53 per BOE in 2001 and $7.19 per BOE in 2000. Anadarkos U.S. finding cost for 2002 was $7.77 per BOE. This compares to $9.60 per BOE in 2001 and $8.49 per BOE in 2000. Excluding mergers and acquisitions, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost for 2002 was $13.43 per BOE compared to $8.75 per BOE in 2001 and $5.83 per BOE in 2000. The Companys U.S. finding cost excluding mergers and acquisitions for 2002 was $8.83 per BOE compared to $9.46 per BOE in 2001 and $6.77 per BOE in 2000. Worldwide finding costs in 2002 increased compared to 2001 due primarily to downward revisions of Venezuelan reserves primarily related to higher prices (see Critical Accounting Policies) and large investments made in leases in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that have not yet been drilled. Finding costs in 2001 were higher than 2000 due primarily to increases in oilfield services costs and increased exploration and development activity. 38 PROVED RESERVES At the end of 2002 and 2001, Anadarkos proved reserves were 2.3 billion BOE compared to 2.1 billion BOE at year end 2000. Anadarkos proved reserves have grown 135% over the past three years, primarily as a result of corporate acquisitions, successful exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico and successful development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and in Algeria. The Companys proved natural gas reserves at year end 2002 were 7.2 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) compared to 7.0 Tcf at year end 2001 and 6.1 Tcf at year end 2000. Anadarkos proved gas reserves have increased 186% since year end 1999, as a result of corporate acquisitions, continued development activity onshore in the U.S. and other producing property acquisitions. Anadarkos crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves at year end 2002 were 1.1 billion barrels compared to 1.1 billion barrels at year end 2001 and 1.0 billion barrels at year end 2000. Crude oil reserves have risen by 97% over the last three years primarily due to corporate acquisitions, successful exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico and successful development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and in Algeria. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves comprise 49% of the Companys proved reserves at year end 2002 and 2001 and 51% at year end 2000. At December 31, 2002, the present value (discounted at 10%) of future net revenues from Anadarkos proved reserves was $21.1 billion, before income taxes, and $14.1 billion, after income taxes, (stated in accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The after income taxes increase of $6.1 billion or 76% in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to significantly higher natural gas and higher crude oil prices at year end 2002, additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling worldwide and corporate acquisitions in 2002. See Critical Accounting Policies and New Accounting Principles and Recent Developments under Item 7 and Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities Unaudited in the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarkos proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES The Companys strategy includes an asset acquisition and divestiture program. In 2002, Anadarko acquired approximately 87 MMBOE of proved reserves, including 74 MMBOE located in the United States primarily from the Howell Corporation (Howell) acquisition (64 MMBOE) and including 13 MMBOE located in Qatar. In 2001, the Company acquired approximately 157 MMBOE of proved reserves, located in: Canada, primarily from the Berkley acquisition (99 MMBOE); Qatar and Oman with the Gulfstream Resources Canada Limited (Gulfstream) acquisition (57 MMBOE); and the United States (1 MMBOE). In 2000, Anadarko acquired with the Anadarko Holding merger transaction approximately 912 MMBOE of proved reserves, located primarily in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Excluding corporate acquisitions, during 2000 2002, Anadarko acquired through purchases and trades 38 MMBOE of proved reserves for $112 million. During the same time period, the Company sold properties, either as a strategic exit from a certain area or asset rationalization in existing core areas, of 100 MMBOE with proceeds totaling $397 million. In 2003, the Company will continue to consider dispositions of certain producing properties in non core areas. 39 PROPERTIES AND LEASES PRODUCING PROPERTIES The Company owns 9,232 net producing gas wells and 7,011 net producing oil wells worldwide. The following schedule shows the number of developed and undeveloped lease acres in which Anadarko held interests at December 31, 2002. ACREAGE DEVELOPED UNDEVELOPED TOTAL GROSS NET GROSS NET GROSS NET thousands United States Onshore Lower 48 2,900 1,959 2,642 1,904 5,542 3,863 Offshore 441 204 1,486 1,129 1,927 1,333 Alaska 25 6 3,144 1,162 3,169 1,168 Total 3,366 2,169 7,272 4,195 10,638 6,364 Canada 1,811 1,024 9,357 3,343 11,168 4,367 Algeria* 219 54 3,775 1,167 3,994 1,221 Other International 570 155 24,896 10,435 25,466 10,590 * Developed acreage in Algeria relates only to areas with an Exploitation License. A portion of the undeveloped acreage in Algeria will be relinquished in the future upon finalization of Exploitation License boundaries. LAND GRANT AND OTHER FEE MINERALS The Company also owns fee mineral interests on acreage totaling 10,159,000 (gross) or 9,101,000 (net) acres as of December 31, 2002. Of this amount, 7,933,000 (gross) or 7,741,000 (net) acres are within the Companys Land Grant area in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, which was granted by the federal government to a predecessor of Anadarko Holding in the mid 1800s. The Company holds royalty interests of varying percentages throughout the Land Grant that are subject to exploration and production agreements with third parties. The Companys fee mineral acreage is primarily undeveloped. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES* 2002 2001 2000 millions Development $1,079 $1,641 $ 921 Exploration 866 1,030 429 Acquisitions of producing properties 14 14 54 Gathering and other 78 244 80 Capitalized interest and internal costs related to exploration and development costs 351 387 224 Total $2,388 $3,316 $1,708 * Excludes corporate acquisitions The Companys primary focus for 2002 was to find additional oil and gas reserves and maintain Company wide production. Anadarkos total capital spending in 2002 was $2.4 billion, a 28% decrease compared to 2001. The decrease from 2001 represents a $562 million decrease in development spending, a $164 million decrease in exploration and a $202 million decrease in gathering and other spending. The decrease in spending for development activities reflects the Companys decision to focus on increasing its inventory of drilling prospects by identifying new reserves through exploration, rather than growing production through development during the down cycle for energy prices earlier in the year. Anadarkos total capital spending in 2001 was $3.3 billion, a 94% increase compared to 2000. The increase from 2000 represents a $720 million increase in development spending, a $601 million increase in exploration spending and a $287 million increase in spending primarily for general properties and capitalized interest. The 40 development spending increase was primarily in the Lower 48 states, while the exploration spending increase was primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Lower 48 states. The Company funded its capital investment programs in 2002, 2001 and 2000 primarily through cash flow, plus increases in long term debt, proceeds from property sales and issuances of common stock. Capital spending for 2003 has been initially set at $2.3 billion, which is a slight decrease compared to 2002. The primary focus of the 2003 budget is to find additional oil and gas reserves and develop existing fields. Anadarko has allocated nearly $1.5 billion to worldwide development projects, primarily for fields in the Gulf of Mexico, western Canada, east and central Texas, north Louisiana, the western states and Algeria. Approximately $380 million is budgeted for exploration programs, mainly in western Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, east Texas, north Louisiana and Alaska. About 70% of the exploration budget will be for drilling compared to 53% in 2002. The remainder of the exploration budget will be used for seismic and lease acquisitions. See Outlook on Liquidity for a discussion of the sources of funds for capital spending. DEBT At year end 2002, Anadarkos total debt was $5.5 billion. This compares to total debt of $5.1 billion at year end 2001 and $4.0 billion at year end 2000. The increases in debt are related primarily to the Howell acquisition in 2002 and the Berkley and Gulfstream acquisitions in 2001. In March 2001, Anadarko issued $650 million of Zero Yield Puttable Contingent Debt Securities (ZYP CODES) due 2021. In March 2002, ZYP CODES in the amount of $620 million were put to the Company for repayment and were paid in cash. Holders of the remaining ZYP CODES have the right to require Anadarko to purchase all or a portion of their ZYP CODES in March 2004, 2006, 2011 or 2016, at $1,000 per ZYP CODES. In February 2002, the Company issued $650 million principal amount of 5 3/8% Notes due 2007. In March 2002, the Company issued $400 million principal amount of 6 1/8% Notes due 2012. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to reduce floating rate debt and to fund a portion of the ZYP CODES put to the Company for repayment in March 2002. In April 2002, Anadarko filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of up to $1 billion in debt securities, preferred stock, preferred securities, depositary shares, common stock, warrants, purchase contracts and purchase units. Net proceeds, terms and pricing of the offerings of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings. In September 2002, Anadarko issued $300 million principal amount of 5% Notes due 2012. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to reduce floating rate debt. These notes were issued under the shelf registration statement filed in April 2002. In October 2002, the Company entered into a 364 Day Revolving Credit Agreement. The agreement provides for $225 million principal amount and expires in 2003. Also in October 2002, Anadarko Canada Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, entered into a 364 Day Canadian Credit Agreement. The agreement provides for $300 million principal amount and expires in 2003. The Canadian agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Anadarko. In addition, the Company has a Revolving Credit Agreement that provides for $225 million principal amount and expires in 2004. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under these credit agreements. PREFERRED STOCK During 2002 and 2001, Anadarko repurchased $2 million and $97 million of preferred stock, respectively. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM In 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $1 billion in shares of Anadarko common stock. The share purchases may be made from time to time, depending on market conditions. Shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. During 2002 and 2001 in conjunction with the stock purchase program, Anadarko sold put options to independent third parties. These put options entitled the holder to sell shares of Anadarko common stock to the Company on certain dates at specified prices. During 2001, Anadarko sold put options for the purchase of a total of 5 million shares of Anadarko common stock with a notional amount of $240 million. A put option for 1 million shares was exercised and put options for 2 million shares expired unexercised in 2001. Put options for the remaining 2 million shares expired unexercised in 2002. In 2002, the Company entered into a put option for 1 million shares of Anadarko common stock with a notional amount of $46 million. The Company received 41 premiums of $7 million during 2002. This put option expired unexercised in 2002. The put options permitted a net share settlement at the Companys option and did not result in a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The following table summarizes purchases under the stock purchase program and the effect of the related put option premiums on the repurchase price.

This debt instrument has been reflected in later years in the table above. Holders of the ZYP CODES due 2021 may put the remaining $30 million principal amount of the ZYP CODES to the Company in 2004. SYNTHETIC LEASES Anadarko has two lease arrangements for its corporate office buildings in The Woodlands, Texas. The development and acquisition of the properties were financed by special purpose entities (SPEs) sponsored by a financial institution. The total amount funded under these leases was $213 million. In addition, the Company has a total lease payment obligation of $11 million related to aircraft operating leases financed by synthetic leases. The table above includes lease payment obligations related to these synthetic leases under operating leases. For additional information see Note 17 Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES As is common in the oil and gas industry, Anadarko has various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. The amounts in the previous table reflect obligations and commitments that are not included in the 2003 capital budget. Following is a description of the Companys significant operating obligations and commitments related to oil and gas activities. Production Platform In April 2002, the Company signed an agreement under which a floating production platform for its Marco Polo discovery in Green Canyon Block 608 of the Gulf of Mexico will be installed. Since the Companys obligation related to the agreement begins at the time of project completion, the table above does not include any amounts related to this agreement. For additional information see Note 17 Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Drilling and Work Commitments Anadarko has various work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The above table includes drilling and work related commitments of $105 million, comprised of $37 million in the United States, $35 million in Canada, $24 million in Algeria and $9 million in other international locations. The commitments in Algeria are related primarily to exploration and development contracts with Sonatrach, who is the registered owner of 4.9% of the Companys outstanding common stock. 42 Sales Commitments In Canada, the Company has commitments to deliver gas under fixed price contracts. The gas volumes to be delivered under these contracts are as follows: COMMITMENTS BY PERIOD 2 3 4 5 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS TOTAL NATURAL GAS Volume million MMBtu 25 33 5 63 Price per MMBtu $2.01 $1.92 $1.69 $1.93 MMBtu million British thermal units OTHER The Company has defined benefit pension plans and supplemental plans that are non contributory pension plans. In January 2003, the Company made a $52 million contribution to a defined benefit pension plan. For additional information on contracts and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time see Note 7 Debt, Note 8 Financial Instruments, Note 18 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans and Note 19 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. OUTLOOK ON LIQUIDITY Anadarkos net cash from operating activities in 2002 was $2.2 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2001 and $1.5 billion in 2000. The decrease in 2002 cash flow is attributed to a significant decrease in natural gas prices. The Companys original capital expenditure budget for 2003 has been set at $2.3 billion and net cash from operating activities in 2003 is expected to be about $2.6 billion. The Company plans to use a portion of 2003 cash flow to repay about $300 million in debt. Cash flow from operations will vary depending upon, among other things, actual commodity prices received throughout the year. The Company intends to adjust capital expenditures to reflect changes in its cash flow from operations. The Companys cash flow and capital expenditure estimates for 2003 were based on prices far below where oil and gas prices were trading in the first quarter of 2003. If higher prices are realized, the Company may expand the drilling program, make targeted acquisitions or further reduce debt. The Company has a stock buyback program to purchase up to $1 billion in shares of Anadarko common stock. Any stock repurchases for 2003 are not included in the announced capital expenditure budget and are not currently anticipated. Both exchange and over the counter traded financial derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements. Margin deposits are required by the Company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed pre determined credit limits. Given the Companys sizable hedge position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements. During January and February 2003, the Companys margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to $125 million. Based on NYMEX future strip prices, the Companys margin deposit requirement was $25 million on March 7, 2003. Anadarko believes that operating cash flow and existing or available credit facilities will be adequate to meet its capital and operating requirements for 2003. The Company funds its day to day operating expenses and capital expenditures from operating cash flows, supplemented as needed by short term borrowings under commercial paper, money market loans or credit facility borrowings. To facilitate such borrowings, the Company has in place $750 million in committed credit facilities, which are supplemented by various non committed credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates. It is the Companys policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may file shelf registrations in advance with the SEC. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property sales and additional borrowing, to secure other funds for additional capital expenditures and stock repurchases. At this time, Anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, through the exercise of 43 stock options, possible redemption of convertible debt securities or through the Companys Employee Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan equity funded contributions. See Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business for additional information. DIVIDENDS In 2002, Anadarko paid $80 million in dividends to its common stockholders (7.5 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter). In 2001, Anadarko paid $57 million in dividends to its common stockholders (5 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 7.5 cents per share in the fourth quarter). The dividend amount in 2000 was $39 million (5 cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in 1986. The Companys credit agreements allow for a maximum capitalization ratio of 60% debt, exclusive of the effect of any non cash write downs. As of December 31, 2002, Anadarkos capitalization ratio was 44% debt. While there is no specific restriction on paying dividends, under the maximum debt capitalization ratio retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends at December 31, 2002. The amount of future common stock dividends will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company also paid $6 million, $7 million and $11 million, respectively, in preferred stock dividends. In 2003, the preferred stock dividends are expected to be $5 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND USE OF ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Anadarko and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company accounts for investments in affiliated companies (generally 20% to 50% owned) using the equity method of accounting. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing financial statements, Management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews its estimates, including those related to litigation, environmental liabilities, income taxes and determination of proved reserves. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the SEC. Under this method of accounting, the costs for unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. The application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and abandonment costs of oil and gas properties and mineral investments is amortized using the unit of production method. All other properties are stated at original cost and depreciated on the straight line basis over the useful life of the assets, which ranges from three to 40 years. PROVED RESERVES Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10(a) (2i), (2ii), (2iii), (3) and (4), are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. Prices do not include the effect of derivative instruments entered into by the Company. 44 Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery are included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for re completion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. The Company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which, by their nature, are subject to revision. The estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Companys engineers, are reviewed and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in assumptions based on, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to uneconomic conditions. Under the terms of Anadarkos risk service contract with the national oil company of Venezuela, Anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices (economic interest method). This means that higher oil prices reduce the Companys reported production volumes and reserves from that project and lower oil prices increase reported production volumes and reserves. Production volume and reserve changes due to the prices used to determine the Companys economic interest have no impact on the value of the project. The following table shows the impact on 2002 at various price levels to demonstrate the effect of the economic interest method. ECONOMIC INTEREST METHOD NYMEX price per barrel $36.00 $30.00 $24.00 Revenues millions $ 88 $ 88 $ 88 Production volumes MMBOE 3 4 5 Reserves MMBOE 65 78 98 COSTS EXCLUDED Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects. Anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the costs to be amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. Costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties. Significant properties, comprised primarily of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks, Alaska, the Land Grant and other international areas, are individually evaluated each quarter by the Companys exploration and engineering staff. Non producing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the Companys exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling individual wells. The Company has a 10 to 15 year exploration and evaluation program for the Land Grant acreage. Costs will be transferred accordingly to the DD&A pool over the length of the program. The Land Grants mineral interests (both working and royalty interests) are owned by the Company in perpetuity. All other significant properties are evaluated over a five to ten year period, depending on the lease term. Insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the United States and Canada. Non producing leases are transferred to the DD&A pool over a three to five year period based on the average lease period. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of evaluation. 45 CAPITALIZED INTEREST SFAS No. 34, "Capitalization of Interest Cost," provides standards for the capitalization of interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets. Under FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 33 "Applying FASB Statement No. 34 to Oil and Gas Producing Operations Accounted for by the Full Cost Method," costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects, on which DD&A expense is not currently taken and on which exploration or development activities are in progress, qualify for capitalization of interest. Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the Companys weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs excluded. Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense. As costs excluded are transferred to the DD&A pool, the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the DD&A pool. CEILING TEST Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10. The ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis. The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of oil and gas properties. That limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. This ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related deferred income tax liability. If the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or non cash write down is required. A ceiling test impairment can give Anadarko a significant loss for a particular period; however, future DD&A expense would be reduced. Shown below is a summary of the ceiling test calculation and description of the major components. Ceiling Test Calculation Present Value of Oil and Gas Properties (PV 10) + Costs Excluded Income Taxes Ceiling Net Oil and Gas Properties and Equipment Deferred Income Tax Liability Net Investment Ceiling Net Investment Cushion (Write off) After Income Taxes Present Value of Oil and Gas Properties (PV 10) Estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs are made in accordance with SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10. The present value of oil and gas properties represents the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted using a prescribed 10% discount rate. Proved oil and gas reserve estimates, which are determined by the Companys engineers, are reviewed and revised as reservoir performance, prices and other economic conditions change. Future net revenues are calculated based on estimated production volumes generally using the oil and gas prices in effect on the last day of the quarter, held flat for the life of the reserves. Future net revenues are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on quarter end cost levels, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the oil and gas prices on the last day of the quarter significantly impact the calculation of the PV 10. At year end 2002, Anadarkos ceiling tests were based on NYMEX prices of $4.60 per Mcf for natural gas and $31.20 per barrel for crude oil. The NYMEX prices are adjusted by location and quality differentials, as appropriate, to determine Anadarkos realized prices. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarkos proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Costs Excluded Costs excluded are capitalized costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects. These costs are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized through DD&A expense. Anadarko excludes all costs until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. When proved reserves are found, the decrease in costs excluded is offset by an increase in PV 10; thereby, 46 generally increasing the ceiling. When proved reserves are not found, the decrease in costs excluded is not offset by an increase in PV 10; thereby, decreasing the ceiling. Income Taxes Future income taxes are based on the existing tax rates applied to the difference between the total of the present value of the future net cash flows plus costs excluded less the tax basis of the oil and gas properties. The effect of tax loss carryforwards and credits related to oil and gas activities is considered in determining income taxes. Net Oil and Gas Properties and Equipment Net oil and gas properties and equipment are the capitalized costs related to oil and gas activities less the accumulated DD&A. Under the full cost method of accounting, the costs for unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. The net capitalized costs are depreciated using the unit of production method. Net properties and equipment increase due to capital expenditures or acquisitions and decrease due to DD&A expense, property divestitures or ceiling test impairments. Deferred Income Tax Liability Deferred income taxes related only to oil and gas properties are included in the deferred income tax liability. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Anadarko uses derivative instruments for various risk management purposes. Effective January 2001, derivative instruments utilized to manage or reduce commodity price risk related to the Companys equity production were accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." Under this statement, all derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Realized gains and losses are recognized in sales when the underlying physical gas and oil production is sold. Accordingly, realized derivative gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized value of the underlying physical gas and oil production. Realized derivative gains and losses are reflected in the average sales price of the physical gas and oil production. Accounting for unrealized gains and losses is dependent on whether the derivative instruments have been designated and qualify as part of a hedging relationship. Derivative instruments may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values, cash flows or foreign currencies, if certain conditions are met. Unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments that do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are recognized currently in other (income) expense. If the hedged exposure is to changes in fair value, the gains and losses on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting losses and gains on the hedged item, are recognized currently in earnings. Consequently, if gains and losses on the derivative instrument and the related hedge item do not completely offset, the difference (i.e., ineffective portion of the hedge) is recognized currently in earnings. If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gains and losses on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gains and losses from the derivative instrument, if any, as well as any amounts excluded from the assessment of the cash flow hedges effectiveness are recognized currently in other (income) expense. Derivative instruments, as well as physical delivery purchase and sale contracts, utilized in the Companys energy trading activities and in the management of price risk associated with the Companys firm transportation keep whole commitment (see Derivative Instruments under Item 7a of this Form 10 K) were accounted for under the mark to market accounting method pursuant to EITF Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." Under this method, the derivatives and physical delivery contracts are revalued in each accounting period and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the statement of income and carried as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. EITF Issue No. 98 10 was rescinded in October 2002. As a result, mark to market accounting is precluded for energy trading contracts that are not derivatives pursuant to SFAS No. 133. The recission of EITF Issue No. 98 10 is effective for contracts entered into after October 25, 2002 and is effective for all contracts January 1, 2003. Substantially all of the Companys physical delivery energy trading contracts are considered to be derivatives pursuant to SFAS No. 133. Therefore, the recission of EITF Issue No. 98 10 did not have a significant impact on the accounting for energy trading contracts as those contracts continue to be marked to market in accordance with SFAS No. 133. The Companys derivative instruments associated with the marketing and trading activities are generally either exchange traded or valued by reference to a commodity that is traded in a liquid market. Valuation is 47 determined by reference to readily available public data. Option valuations are based on the Black Scholes option pricing model and verified against third party quotations. The fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated with quoted natural gas basis prices. Basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the NYMEX gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices, discounted at 10% per year. Management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors (such as expected drilling activity, anticipated pipeline construction projects, expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points, etc.) that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS New Accounting Principles For information on New Accounting Principles see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Proved Reserves The SEC is currently in the process of obtaining information from oil and gas exploration companies operating offshore (including Anadarko) to assess the criteria being used by industry to determine proved reserves related to new field discoveries offshore. The SEC regulations allow companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either an actual production test (flow test) or conclusive formation testing. In the absence of a production test, compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves related to the initial discovery of a field. In deep water environments where production tests are extremely expensive, the industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility. Anadarko has recorded proved reserves related to the initial discovery of four offshore fields based on conclusive formation tests rather than actual production tests. As of December 31, 2002, these proved reserves amounted to 100 MMBOE or less than 5% of Anadarkos total worldwide proved reserves. The Company is currently developing all of these fields and expects the majority of the production from these fields to commence during 2004. Anadarko believes the reserves were properly classified. Most of these reserves are located at Marco Polo, a deep water field under development at Green Canyon Block 608. Ryder Scott Company, an independent petroleum consulting company, has reviewed Anadarkos technical data and studies used to support the classification of proved reserves at the Marco Polo field. Ryder Scotts review concludes that the reserves meet the SECs definition of proved reserves. A copy of the Ryder Scott report is attached as Exhibit 99.3 to this Form 10 K. Anadarko has furnished the information requested to the SEC and is unable to predict the likely outcome of the SECs staff review of this industry practice. The issue is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys proved reserves or financial results; however, if the issue is not favorably resolved, Anadarko may be required to revise its proved reserve estimates, which would affect Anadarkos finding costs per barrel, reserve replacement ratios and DD&A expense, until flow tests are conducted or production commences. REGULATORY MATTERS AND ADDITIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING BUSINESS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The Company has made in this report, and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning the Companys operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and gas properties, and those statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "estimates," "projects," "target," "goal," "plans," "objective," "should" or similar expressions or variations on such expressions. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of 48 factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10 K and in the Companys other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. COMMODITY PRICING AND DEMAND Crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide, pricing decisions and production quotas of OPEC and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets. Natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile. In periods of sharply lower commodity prices, the Company may curtail production and capital spending projects, as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows. Changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the Companys determination of proved reserves and the Companys calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves. In addition, demand for oil and gas in the U.S. and worldwide may affect the Companys level of production. Under the full cost method of accounting, a non cash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the Companys oil and gas properties on a country by country basis may be required when prices are low. Whether the Company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter, as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter. While this non cash charge can give Anadarko a significant reported loss for the period, future expenses for DD&A will be reduced. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY The Companys oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the release of emissions into the atmosphere, the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials, offshore oil and gas operations, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the Companys failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the Companys operations. Anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the Companys operations or financial condition in the past. However, because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the Companys operations or financial condition. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the Company is involved, see Note 19 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. EXPLORATION AND OPERATING RISKS The Companys business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons. As protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, the Company maintains insurance coverage, including certain physical damage, employers liability, comprehensive general liability and workers compensation insurance. Although Anadarko is not insured against all risks in all aspects of its business, such as political risk, business interruption risk and risk of major terrorist attacks, the Company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations. The occurrence of a significant event against which the Company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position. DEVELOPMENT RISKS The Company is involved in several large development projects. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include: project approvals by joint venture partners; timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies; manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment; and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons. In large development projects, these uncertainties are usually resolved, but delays and differences between 49 estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may, therefore, affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects. DOMESTIC GOVERNMENTAL RISKS The domestic operations of the Company have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations. FOREIGN OPERATIONS RISK The Companys operations in areas outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include, among other things, loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, insurrection and other political risks, increases in taxes and governmental royalties, renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the Companys international operations. The Companys international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation. To date, the Companys international operations have not been materially affected by these risks. COMPETITION The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. The Companys competitors include the major oil companies, independent oil and gas concerns, individual producers, gas marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers. OTHER Regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells, regulate well spacing, prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters. Operations conducted by the Company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes. Additionally, certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management and the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In addition to the standard permit process, federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS General The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. The Company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims, including numerous claims by employees of third party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos and benzene while working at a refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, which Anadarko Holding sold in segments in 1987 and 1989. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, Management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company, although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved. For a description of certain legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10 K. 50 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Anadarkos commodity derivative instruments currently are comprised of futures, swaps and options contracts. The volume of commodity derivative instruments utilized by the Company to hedge its market price risk and in its energy trading operation can vary during the year within the boundaries of its established risk management policy guidelines. For information regarding the Companys accounting policies related to derivatives and additional information related to the Companys derivative instruments, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Derivative Instruments Held for Non Trading Purposes The Company had equity production hedges of 334 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of crude oil as of December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a net unrealized loss of $154 million before taxes on these commodity derivative instruments. Based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase in commodity prices would result in an additional loss on these commodity derivative instruments of approximately $166 million. However, this loss would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of that portion of the Companys equity production that is hedged. Derivative Instruments Held for Trading Purposes As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a net unrealized gain of $24 million (gains of $73 million and losses of $49 million) on commodity derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes and a net unrealized loss of $30 million (gains of $16 million and losses of $46 million) on physical contracts entered into for trading purposes. Based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices, the potential additional loss on the derivative instruments would be approximately $20 million. Firm Transportation Keep Whole Agreement Anadarko Holding Company (Anadarko Holding) was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its gathering, processing and marketing (GPM) business segment, which was sold in 1999 to Duke Energy (Duke). As part of the GPM disposition, Anadarko Holding agreed to pay Duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates, while Duke will pay Anadarko Holding if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates (keep whole agreement). This keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contracts expiration date or February 2009. The Company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure under the keep whole agreement to potential decreases in future transportation market values. Due to decreased liquidity, the use of derivative instruments to manage this risk is generally limited to the forward twelve months. As of December 31, 2002, accounts payable included $5 million and other long term liabilities included $68 million related to this agreement. As of December 31, 2001, accounts payable included $27 million and other long term liabilities included $80 million related to this agreement. A 10% unfavorable change in prices on the short term portion of the keep whole agreement would result in an additional loss of $10 million. The future gain or loss from this agreement cannot be accurately predicted. For additional information related to the keep whole agreement, see Note 8 Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. For additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio and the firm transportation keep whole agreement see Marketing Strategies under Item 7 of this Form 10 K. COMMODITY PRICE RISK As a result of low natural gas and oil prices at September 30, 2001, Anadarkos capitalized costs of oil and gas properties primarily in the United States, Canada and Argentina exceeded the ceiling limitation and the Company recorded a $2.5 billion ($1.6 billion after taxes) non cash write down in the third quarter of 2001. The pre tax write down is reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. See Critical Accounting Policies and Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business under Item 7 of this Form 10 K. INTEREST RATE RISK Anadarko is also exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of the Companys variable and fixed interest rate debt. The Company believes the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of the Companys various debt instruments is not material. 51 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Companys Canadian subsidiaries use the Canadian dollar as their functional currency. The Companys other international subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, a Canadian subsidiary had $98 million and $187 million, respectively, outstanding of fixed rate notes and debentures denominated in U.S. dollars. The potential foreign currency remeasurement impact on earnings from a 10% increase in the December 31, 2002 Canadian exchange rate would be about $9 million based on the outstanding debt at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Companys Latin American subsidiaries had foreign deferred tax liabilities denominated in the local currency equivalent totaling $49 million and $78 million, respectively. In conjunction with the sale of certain properties in 2001, the Company indemnified a purchaser for the use of local tax losses denominated in the local currency equivalent totaling $22 million. The potential foreign currency remeasurement impact on net earnings from a 10% increase in the year end Latin American exchange rates would be approximately $4 million. For additional information related to foreign currency risk see Note 8 Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 52
