Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Anadarko Petroleum Corporations primary line of business is the exploration, development, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Companys major areas of operations are located in the United States, Canada and Algeria. The Company is also active in Venezuela, Qatar and several other countries. The Companys focus is on adding high margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive finding and development costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of producing oil and gas. The primary factors that affect the Companys results of operations include, among other things, commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, production volumes, the Companys ability to find additional oil and gas reserves, as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko or Company refer to Anadarko and its subsidiaries. Selected Data 2003 2002 2001 millions except per share amounts Financial Results Revenues $ 5,122 $ 3,845 $ 4,718 Costs and expenses 2,914 2,435 5,081 Interest expense and other (income) expense 234 203 27 Income tax expense (benefit) 729 376 (214 ) Net income (loss) available to common stockholders $ 1,287 $ 825 $ (188 ) Earnings (loss) per share diluted $ 5.09 $ 3.21 $ (0.75 ) Operating Results Annual sales volumes (MMBOE) 192 197 199 Worldwide reserve replacement (% of production) 196 % 112 % 221 % Worldwide finding cost ($/BOE) $ 6.95 $ 10.52 $ 8.53 Total proved reserves (MMBOE) 2,513 2,328 2,305 Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital expenditures $ 2,792 $ 2,388 $ 3,316 Cash flow from operating activities 3,043 2,196 3,321 Total debt 5,058 5,471 5,050 Stockholders equity $ 8,599 $ 6,972 $ 6,365 Debt capitalization ratio 37 % 44 % 44 % Financial Results Net Income Anadarkos net income available to common stockholders for 2003 totaled nearly $1.3 billion, or $5.09 per share (diluted), compared to net income available to common stockholders for 2002 of $825 million, or $3.21 per share (diluted). The increase in net income in 2003 is due primarily to significantly higher commodity prices, partially offset by higher costs and expenses. Anadarko had a net loss available to common stockholders in 2001 of $188 million or $0.75 per share (diluted). The net loss for 2001 included noncash charges of $2.5 billion ($1.6 billion after taxes) for impairments of the carrying value of oil and gas properties primarily in the United States, Canada and Argentina as a result of low natural gas and oil prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. In 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recorded in the period incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The related cumulative adjustment to net income was an increase of $47 million after income taxes, or $0.18 per share (diluted). The application of SFAS No. 143 did not have a material impact on the Companys depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense, net income or earnings per share in 2003. There was no impact on the Companys cash flow as a result of adopting SFAS No. 143. In 2002, the Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 32 Revenues 2003 2002 2001 millions Gas sales $ 2,851 $ 1,828 $ 2,952 Oil and condensate sales 1,787 1,682 1,397 Natural gas liquids sales 365 222 256 Other sales 119 113 113 Total $ 5,122 $ 3,845 $ 4,718 Anadarkos total revenues for 2003 increased $1.3 billion or 33% compared to 2002 due primarily to significantly higher commodity prices, partially offset by slightly lower sales volumes. Total revenues for 2002 were down $873 million or 19% compared to 2001 due primarily to a significant decrease in natural gas prices and decreases in natural gas volumes, partially offset by higher crude oil prices and volumes. Unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments that do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in gas sales and oil sales and are reflected in the average sales prices. In 2003, these amounts for prior periods were reclassified from other (income) expense to gas sales and oil sales. The amount of the reclassification was not significant and had no effect on net income or per share amounts. The impact of hedges and marketing activities resulted in lower realized prices of $0.27 per Mcf of gas and $1.42 per barrel of oil for 2003 compared to market prices, decreasing revenues $267 million. For 2002, the impact of hedges and marketing activities resulted in higher realized prices of $0.14 per Mcf of gas and lower realized prices of $0.32 per barrel of oil compared to market prices, resulting in a net increase to revenues of $62 million. For 2001, the impact of hedges and marketing activities resulted in higher realized prices of $0.26 per Mcf of gas and $0.64 per barrel of oil compared to market prices, increasing revenues $227 million. Analysis of Sales Volumes 2003 2002 2001 Barrels of Oil Equivalent (MMBOE) United States 135 130 144 Canada 30 35 34 Algeria 19 24 8 Other International 8 8 13 Total 192 197 199 Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day (MBOE/d) United States 368 355 394 Canada 83 97 93 Algeria 52 65 22 Other International 22 22 37 Total 525 539 546 During 2003, Anadarko sold 192 MMBOE, a decrease of 5 MMBOE or 3% compared to sales of 197 MMBOE in 2002. The decrease for 2003 was primarily due to lower volumes of 5 MMBOE from operations in Canada, related primarily to the divestiture of heavy oil properties in late 2002 and 5 MMBOE from operations in Algeria due primarily to the substantial completion of cost recovery, whereby Anadarko was reimbursed for previous exploration spending with additional barrels of oil production. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes of 5 MMBOE from operations in the United States, primarily due to higher oil production in the western states as a result of the acquisition of Howell in late 2002. The Companys sales volumes were down 2 MMBOE or 1% in 2002 compared to sales of 199 MMBOE in 2001. The decrease for 2002 was primarily due to lower volumes of 14 MMBOE due to operations in the United States, primarily offshore and in Texas and Louisiana, and 4 MMBOE related to the disposition of operations in Guatemala and Argentina in 2001. The decrease in volumes in the United States was primarily a result of natural production declines and a decrease in development drilling in late 2001 and early 2002 in response to lower commodity prices. These lower volumes were offset by an increase of 16 MMBOE in Algeria due to the expansion of production facilities. 33 Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future. See Derivative Instruments under Item 7a of this Form 10 K. Natural Gas Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2003 2002 2001 United States (Bcf) 503 507 573 MMcf/d 1,379 1,390 1,569 Price per Mcf $ 4.36 $ 2.83 $ 4.23 Canada (Bcf) 140 135 121 MMcf/d 383 370 331 Price per Mcf $ 4.71 $ 2.91 $ 4.38 Other International (Bcf) 1 MMcf/d 4 Price per Mcf $ $ $ 1.22 Total (Bcf) 643 642 695 MMcf/d 1,762 1,760 1,904 Price per Mcf $ 4.43 $ 2.85 $ 4.25 Anadarkos natural gas sales volumes for 2003 were essentially flat compared to 2002. An increase in natural gas sales volumes in Texas, Louisiana and Canada due to successful exploration and development activities was offset by a decrease in the Gulf of Mexico, as a result of temporary operational issues and natural production declines. The Companys natural gas sales volumes in 2002 were down 53 Bcf or 8% compared to 2001. The decrease in 2002 was due primarily to lower volumes of 66 Bcf from operations within the United States, primarily offshore and in Texas, partially offset by higher volumes of 14 Bcf from operations in Canada primarily due to the Berkley acquisition in 2001. Production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand. However, the Company may decide during periods of low commodity prices to decrease development activity, which can result in lower production volumes. The Companys average realized natural gas price in 2003 increased 55% compared to 2002. Strong demand in North America due to colder weather and declining gas supply resulted in significantly higher gas prices. These higher prices were partially offset by commodity price hedges on 49% of natural gas sales volumes during 2003 that reduced the Companys exposure to low prices and limited participation in higher prices. The Companys average realized natural gas price in 2002 decreased 33% compared to 2001. The decrease in prices during 2002 was attributed to a severe decline in natural gas demand as a result of high prices in early 2001, followed by a national economic downturn and mild summer weather in 2001. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has hedged about 34% of its anticipated natural gas wellhead sales volumes for 2004. See Derivative Instruments under Item 7a of this Form 10 K. 34 Crude Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2003 2002 2001 United States (MMBbls) 34 31 34 MBbls/d 93 85 93 Price per barrel $ 26.16 $ 22.90 $ 23.08 Canada (MMBbls) 6 12 13 MBbls/d 17 33 35 Price per barrel $ 27.33 $ 19.09 $ 18.18 Algeria (MMBbls) 19 24 8 MBbls/d 52 65 22 Price per barrel $ 28.43 $ 24.38 $ 23.97 Other International (MMBbls) 8 8 13 MBbls/d 22 22 36 Price per barrel $ 23.15 $ 19.92 $ 14.35 Total (MMBbls) 67 75 68 MBbls/d 184 205 186 Price per barrel $ 26.55 $ 22.44 $ 20.56 Anadarkos crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2003 decreased 8 MMBbls or 11% compared to 2002 due to lower volumes of 6 MMBbls in Canada and 5 MMBbls in Algeria, partially offset by higher volumes of 3 MMBbls in the United States. The lower Canada volumes are due largely to the sale of the Companys heavy oil assets in late 2002. The lower Algeria volumes are due primarily to the substantial completion of cost recovery, whereby Anadarko was reimbursed for previous exploration spending with additional barrels of oil production. The higher volumes in the United States are primarily in the western states as a result of the Howell acquisition in late 2002. Crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2002 increased 7 MMBbls or 10% compared to 2001. The increase was due primarily to higher volumes of 16 MMBbls from operations in Algeria primarily due to the expansion of production facilities and 2 MMBbls due to the acquisition of producing properties in Qatar in 2001. These higher volumes were partially offset by lower volumes of 4 MMBbls due to the sale of producing properties in Guatemala and Argentina in 2001, 3 MMBbls related to operations in the United States, primarily offshore, and 3 MMBbls in Venezuela primarily due to higher oil prices. Production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices. Anadarkos average realized crude oil price in 2003 increased 18% compared to 2002. The higher crude oil prices during 2003 are attributed primarily to political unrest in the Middle East, the oil workers strike in Venezuela, low oil inventory levels and increased demand. These higher prices were partially offset by commodity price hedges on 38% of crude oil and condensate sales volumes during 2003 that reduced the Companys exposure to low prices and limited participation in higher prices. The Companys average realized crude oil price in 2002 increased 9% compared to 2001. The higher crude oil prices in 2002 were due primarily to continued uncertainty of the situation in the Middle East, the oil workers strike in Venezuela and a colder than normal winter late in 2002 that increased oil demand in the United States. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had hedged about 37% of its anticipated oil and condensate volumes for 2004. Natural Gas Liquids Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2003 2002 2001 Total (MMBbls) 17 15 15 MBbls/d 47 41 42 Price per barrel $ 21.18 $ 14.80 $ 16.55 35 The Companys 2003 NGLs sales volumes increased 2 MMBbls or 13% compared to 2002 primarily due to additional natural gas volumes processed in central Texas. NGLs sales volumes in 2002 were essentially flat compared to 2001. During 2003, average NGLs prices increased 43% compared to 2002. The higher NGLs prices are attributed primarily to high natural gas prices in the United States during 2003. Natural gas prices generally serve as a minimum or floor for NGLs prices because NGLs production is highly dependent on the economics of processing the natural gas to extract NGLs. The 2002 average NGLs prices decreased 11% compared to 2001. High levels of NGLs inventories in the United States during the first half of 2002, coupled with lower demand for NGLs by the petrochemical industry, caused NGLs prices to decline. Costs and Expenses 2003 2002 2001 millions Operating expenses Direct operating $ 630 $ 577 $ 553 Cost of product and transportation 198 170 216 Total operating expenses 828 747 769 Administrative and general 352 314 292 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,297 1,121 1,154 Other taxes 294 214 247 Impairments related to oil and gas properties 103 39 2,546 Restructuring costs 40 Amortization of goodwill 73 Total $ 2,914 $ 2,435 $ 5,081 During 2003, Anadarkos costs and expenses increased $479 million or 20% compared to 2002 due to the following factors: Operating expenses increased $81 million (11%) due to increases of $53 million in direct operating expenses and $28 million in cost of product and transportation expenses. The increase in direct operating expenses is due primarily to the acquisition of producing properties in the western states in late 2002 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2003, an increase in electricity, fuel and other lease expenses attributed to the effect of increased commodity prices and the impact of an increase in the Canadian exchange rate. These increases were partially offset by the effect of the sale of heavy oil properties in Canada in late 2002. The increase in cost of product and transportation expenses was due primarily to an increase in volumes of NGLs processed and higher transportation rates. Administrative and general (A&G) expense increased $38 million (12%). A&G expense in 2003 included $24 million in benefits expenses and $8 million in salaries expenses related to executive transitions during 2003. Excluding executive transition expenses, A&G expense increased $17 million for the first six months of 2003 and decreased $11 million in the last half of 2003 as a result of the cost reduction plan implemented in July 2003. DD&A expense increased $176 million (16%). DD&A increases include about $180 million primarily due to higher costs associated with finding and developing oil and gas reserves (including the transfer of excluded costs to the DD&A pool), $20 million due to asset retirement obligation accretion expense related to SFAS No. 143 and $8 million related to higher DD&A on general properties. These increases were partially offset by a $32 million decrease due to lower production volumes. Other taxes increased $80 million (37%) due primarily to significantly higher commodity prices. Impairments of oil and gas properties in 2003 are due to a $68 million ceiling test impairment for Qatar as a result of lower future production estimates and unsuccessful exploration activities as well as $35 million related to unsuccessful exploration activities in Australia ($19 million), Gabon ($7 million), Tunisia ($7 million), Angola ($1 million) and Kazakhstan ($1 million). Restructuring costs of $40 million related to one time charges for employee termination benefits, primarily severance payments, and other costs associated with the Companys cost reduction plan. 36 During 2002, Anadarkos costs and expenses decreased $2.6 billion or 52% compared to 2001 due to the following factors: Operating expenses decreased $22 million (3%) due to a decrease in cost of product and transportation expenses related primarily to a decrease in costs associated with processing NGLs, partially offset by an increase in direct operating expenses primarily related to the acquisition of producing properties in Qatar in the second half of 2001. A&G expense increased $22 million (8%). An increase of $58 million due primarily to increases in benefits and salaries expenses associated with the Companys workforce was partially offset by a $31 million decrease in merger related expenses and a $5 million decrease related to an adjustment to provisions for uncollectible accounts. DD&A expense decreased $33 million (3%). About $180 million of the decrease is related to the DD&A rate reduction as a result of ceiling test impairments in the third quarter of 2001 and $13 million of the decrease is due to slightly lower production volumes. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $135 million due to increases in the DD&A rate resulting from higher costs associated with finding and developing oil and gas reserves (including the transfer of excluded costs to the DD&A pool) and an increase of $25 million related to DD&A on general properties. Other taxes decreased $33 million (13%). The decrease is primarily due to a $40 million decrease in production taxes as a result of lower commodity prices and slightly lower production volumes in 2002, partially offset by higher ad valorem taxes. Impairments of oil and gas properties in 2002 related primarily to unsuccessful exploration activities in Congo ($16 million), Oman ($10 million), Australia ($7 million) and Tunisia ($5 million). Impairments in 2001 were primarily due to low oil and gas prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001, which resulted in ceiling test impairments for the United States ($1.7 billion), Canada ($808 million) and Argentina ($15 million). Amortization of goodwill was discontinued in 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Interest Expense and Other (Income) Expense 2003 2002 2001 millions Interest Expense Gross interest expense $ 374 $ 358 $ 301 Capitalized interest (121 ) (155 ) (209 ) Net interest expense 253 203 92 Other (Income) Expense Foreign currency exchange (19 ) 1 29 Firm transportation keep whole contract valuation (9 ) (35 ) (91 ) Ineffectiveness of derivative financial instruments 9 18 (18 ) Gas sales contracts accretion of discount 7 11 14 Other (7 ) 5 1 Total Other (Income) Expense (19 ) (65 ) Total $ 234 $ 203 $ 27 Interest Expense Anadarkos gross interest expense has increased over the past three years due primarily to higher levels of borrowings for capital expenditures, including corporate and producing property acquisitions. Gross interest expense in 2003 increased 4% compared to 2002 primarily due to the expensing of debt issuance costs related to the Company redeeming the Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020 in 2003 and slightly higher interest rates caused by the redemption of the Zero Yield Puttable Contingent Debt Securities in 2002, which were put to the Company and replaced with higher rate debt. Gross interest expense in 2002 increased 19% compared to 2001 primarily due to higher average debt outstanding in 2002 primarily because of acquisitions in 2001 and slightly higher interest rates. See Capital Resources and Liquidity. In 2003, capitalized interest decreased by 22% compared to 2002. In 2002, capitalized interest decreased by 26% compared to 2001. These decreases were primarily due to a decrease in capitalized costs that qualify for interest 37 capitalization. For additional information about the Companys policies regarding costs excluded and capitalized interest see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Costs Excluded and Capitalized Interest. Other (Income) Expense During 2003, foreign exchange gains increased $20 million compared to 2002 due primarily to the impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar on the Companys outstanding Canadian debt that is denominated in the United States dollar. Gains from the firm transportation keep whole contract valuation decreased $26 million during 2003 primarily due to the effect of lower market values for firm transportation subject to the keep whole agreement. During 2002, foreign exchange losses decreased $28 million compared to 2001 primarily due to the restructuring of Canadian debt and strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Gains from the firm transportation keep whole contract valuation decreased $56 million during 2002 primarily due to the effect of lower market values for firm transportation subject to the keep whole agreement. See Derivative Instruments and Foreign Currency Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10 K. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 2003 2002 2001 millions Income tax expense (benefit) $ 775 $ 381 $ (183 ) Effect of change in Canadian income tax rate (46 ) (5 ) (31 ) Total $ 729 $ 376 $ (214 ) For 2003, income taxes increased $353 million compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to the increase in earnings before income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in Canadian taxes due to a Canadian federal income tax rate reduction from 28% to 21% over a five year period beginning in 2003. Income taxes for 2002 increased $590 million compared to 2001. Income taxes for 2001 included a benefit of approximately $962 million related to the impairment of the carrying value of oil and gas properties in the United States, Canada and Argentina as a result of low natural gas and crude oil prices at the end of the third quarter of 2001. Excluding the effect of the impairment and related tax benefit in 2001, income taxes for 2002 decreased primarily due to the decrease in earnings before income taxes. The effective tax rate for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 37%, 31% and 55%, respectively. The variances in the effective tax rate for 2003 and 2002 from the statutory rate of 35% were due primarily to income taxes related to foreign operations. The effective tax rate for 2001 was 35%, excluding the effect of the impairments and the related tax benefit. Operating Results Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves, among other factors. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties. Reserve Replacement Anadarko continues to be successful in replacing reserves. For the 22nd consecutive year, Anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The following table shows the Companys reserve replacement through all means, including extensions and discoveries, revisions, improved recovery and purchases or sales of proved reserves, as a percentage of production volumes. Reserve replacement percentages excluding acquisitions and divestitures represent reserve replacement achieved through drilling and development. 38 Five Year Average 2003 2002 2001 Worldwide Reserve replacement 310 % 196 % 112 % 221 % Reserve replacement excluding acquisitions and divestitures 164 % 176 % 87 % 173 % Production (MMBOE) 150 192 196 201 United States Reserve replacement 290 % 232 % 185 % 161 % Reserve replacement excluding acquisitions and divestitures 168 % 204 % 137 % 160 % Production (MMBOE) 107 135 130 144 The Companys worldwide reserve replacement excluding acquisitions and divestitures increased to 176% in 2003. This increase was primarily due to successful drilling in the U.S. and Canada. The decrease in 2002 compared to 2001 was partially due to a downward revision of 36 MMBOE in Venezuela due to increased prices. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Anadarkos U.S. reserve replacement percentage excluding acquisitions and divestitures increased to 204% in 2003. The increase in 2003 was due primarily to successful drilling in east Texas and Louisiana and successful enhanced oil recovery projects in the western states. The Companys U.S. reserve replacement for the five year period 1999 2003 was 168% excluding acquisitions and divestitures. By comparison, the most recent published U.S. industry average (1998 2002) was 111% (Source: DOE). Anadarkos U.S. reserve replacement performance for the same period of 1998 2002 was 179% of production, excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Industry data for 2003 is not yet available. Cost of Finding Cost of finding represents the cost of proved reserves added through all means, including additions related to extensions and discoveries, revisions, improved recovery and purchases of proved reserves. The following table shows the Companys cost of finding proved reserves of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs, stated on a BOE basis. Cost of finding excludes asset retirement costs and includes actual asset retirement expenditures. Five Year Average 2003 2002 2001 Worldwide Cost of finding $ 7.65 $ 6.95 $ 10.52 $ 8.53 Cost of finding excluding acquisitions $ 8.10 $ 7.47 $ 13.43 $ 8.75 United States Cost of finding $ 8.10 $ 6.26 $ 7.77 $ 9.60 Cost of finding excluding acquisitions $ 8.04 $ 6.56 $ 8.83 $ 9.46 Worldwide finding costs in 2003 decreased 34% compared to 2002. Worldwide finding costs in 2002 were higher than 2003 and 2001 due primarily to downward revisions of Venezuelan reserves primarily related to higher prices (see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates) and large investments made in leases in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that had not yet been drilled. Cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development. A better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period. For the five year period 1999 2003, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost was $7.65 per BOE and its U.S. finding cost was $8.10 per BOE. For the previous five year period 1998 2002, Anadarkos worldwide finding cost was $7.24 per BOE and its U.S. finding cost was $7.78 per BOE. Excluding acquisitions, Anadarkos worldwide and U.S. finding costs for the five year period 1999 2003 were $8.10 per BOE and $8.04 per BOE, respectively. For the previous five year period 1998 2002, the Companys worldwide and U.S. finding costs excluding acquisitions were $7.23 per BOE and $7.44 per BOE, respectively. Proved Reserves At the end of 2003, Anadarkos proved reserves were 2.5 billion BOE compared to 2.3 billion BOE at year end 2002 and 2001. Anadarkos proved reserves have grown 22% over the past three years, primarily as a result of corporate acquisitions, successful exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico and successful development programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and in Algeria. 39 The Companys proved natural gas reserves at year end 2003 were 7.7 Tcf compared to 7.2 Tcf at year end 2002 and 7.0 Tcf at year end 2001. Anadarkos proved gas reserves have increased 27% since year end 2000, as a result of corporate acquisitions, continued development activity onshore in the U.S. and producing property acquisitions. Anadarkos proved crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves at year end 2003 were 1.2 billion barrels compared to 1.1 billion barrels at year end 2002 and 2001. Proved crude oil reserves have risen 17% over the last three years primarily due to corporate acquisitions, successful exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico and successful development programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and in Algeria. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs comprise 49% of the Companys proved reserves at year end 2003, 2002 and 2001. At December 31, 2003, the present value (discounted at 10%) of future net revenues from Anadarkos proved reserves was $27.8 billion, before income taxes, and $18.8 billion, after income taxes, (stated in accordance with the regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The after income taxes increase of $4.7 billion or 33% in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily due to additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling and development and higher natural gas prices at year end 2003. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarkos proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Recent Developments The SEC obtained information from oil and gas companies operating offshore (including Anadarko) to assess the criteria being used by industry to determine proved reserves related to new field discoveries offshore. The SEC regulations allow companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either an actual production test (flow test) or conclusive formation testing. In the absence of a production test, compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves related to the initial discovery of a field. In deepwater environments where production tests are extremely expensive, the industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility. Anadarko has recorded proved reserves related to the initial discovery of four offshore fields based on conclusive formation tests rather than actual production tests. As of December 31, 2003, these proved reserves amounted to 143 MMBOE or less than 6% of Anadarkos total worldwide proved reserves. A significant portion of these reserves are located at Marco Polo, a deepwater field at Green Canyon Block 608 scheduled for first production in mid 2004. The Company is currently developing three other fields (K2, K2 North and Tarantula) and expects production from these fields to commence in 2005. When production commences, the issue of economic producibility is resolved. Anadarko believes these reserves are properly classified. Anadarko is unable to predict the likely outcome of the SECs staff review of this industry practice. The issue is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys proved reserves or financial results; however, if the issue is not favorably resolved, Anadarko may be required to revise its proved reserve estimates, which would affect Anadarkos finding costs per barrel, reserve replacement ratios and DD&A expense, until flow tests are conducted or production commences. Drilling Activity During 2003, Anadarko participated in a total of 1,069 gross wells, including 707 gas wells, 299 oil wells and 63 dry holes. This compares to 949 gross wells (686 gas wells, 217 oil wells and 46 dry holes) in 2002 and 1,420 gross wells (970 gas wells, 375 oil wells and 75 dry holes) in 2001. The increase in activity during 2003 reflects the Companys increase in spending for development drilling in response to higher commodity prices in 2003. The decrease in activity during 2002 reflects the Companys reduced spending for development drilling in response to lower commodity prices in late 2001 and early 2002.

Net: working interest ownership. Acquisitions and Divestitures The Companys strategy includes an asset acquisition and divestiture program. In 2003, Anadarko acquired approximately 54 MMBOE of proved reserves, located primarily in the United States. In 2002, Anadarko acquired approximately 87 MMBOE of proved reserves, including 74 MMBOE located in the United States primarily from the Howell acquisition (64 MMBOE) and 13 MMBOE located in Qatar. In 2001, the Company acquired approximately 157 MMBOE of proved reserves, located in: Canada, primarily from the Berkley acquisition (99 MMBOE); Qatar and Oman from the Gulfstream Resources Canada Limited acquisition (57 MMBOE); and the United States (1 MMBOE). Excluding corporate acquisitions, during 2001 2003, Anadarko acquired through purchases and trades 78 MMBOE of proved reserves for $326 million. During the same time period, the Company sold properties, either as a strategic exit from a certain area or asset rationalization in existing core areas, of 113 MMBOE with proceeds totaling $516 million. In 2004, the Company will continue to consider dispositions of certain producing properties in non core areas. Marketing Strategies Overview The Companys sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale. Therefore, even though the Company sells significant volumes to major purchasers, the Company believes other purchasers would be willing to buy the Companys natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs at comparable market prices. The Companys marketing department actively manages sales of its oil and gas. The Company markets its production to customers at competitive prices, maximizing realized prices while managing credit exposure. The market knowledge gained through the marketing effort is valuable to the corporate decision making process. The Company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs. However, the Company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities. The Companys trading risk position, typically, is a net short position that is offset by the Companys natural long position as a producer. Essentially all of the Companys trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months. See Derivative Instruments under Item 7a of this Form 10 K. Since 2002, all segments of the energy market have experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition, liquidity and credit. This has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies. In 2003, Anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third party gas purchasers; however, in certain situations the Company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases. Natural Gas Natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of North Americas energy needs and the Company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue. The tightening of the natural gas supply and demand fundamentals has resulted in extremely volatile natural gas prices, which is expected to continue. 41 Anadarko markets its equity natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets. Anadarko Energy Services Company (AES), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is a marketing company offering supply assurance, competitive pricing, risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs. The Company also purchases natural gas physical volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near Anadarkos production. These purchases allow the Company to aggregate larger volumes of gas and attract larger, creditworthy customers, which in turn enhances the value of the Companys production. The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility. Included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative instruments. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 35%, 39% and 31%, respectively, of the Companys gas production was sold under long term contracts to Duke Energy (Duke). These sales represent 22%, 18% and 27%, respectively, of total revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Most of these contracts have expired or will expire at the end of the first quarter of 2004. The Company expects to integrate the marketing of the natural gas previously sold to Duke into its current marketing operations and sell it to various purchasers under short term agreements at market prices. Volumes sold to Duke under the long term contracts were at market prices. A company Anadarko acquired in 2000 was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within the gathering, processing and marketing (GPM) business segment, which was sold in 1999 to Duke. Most of these agreements were transferred to Duke in the GPM disposition. One agreement was retained, but is managed and operated by Duke. Anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the Companys natural gas. As part of the GPM disposition, Anadarko pays Duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates, while Duke pays Anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates (keep whole agreement). This keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contracts expiration date or February 2009. The Company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure under the Duke keep whole agreement to potential decreases in future transportation market values. While derivatives are intended to reduce the Companys exposure to declines in the market value of firm transportation, they also limit the potential to benefit from increases in the market value of firm transportation. The fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis prices. Basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices, discounted at 10% per year. Management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors (such as expected drilling activity, anticipated pipeline construction projects, expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points, etc.) that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted. Crude Oil, Condensate and NGLs Anadarkos crude oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Canada, Algeria and other international areas. Most of the Companys U.S. crude oil and NGLs production is sold under 30 day evergreen contracts with prices based on marketing indices and adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Most of the Companys Canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater. Oil from Algeria and other international areas is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel. The Company also purchases and sells third party produced crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Companys domestic and international market areas. Included in this strategy is the use of various derivative instruments. Gas Gathering Systems and Processing Anadarkos investment in gas gathering operations allows the Company to better manage its gas production, improve ultimate recovery of reserves, enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities. The Company has invested about $175 million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years. The vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from Anadarko operated wells. The Company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction of NGLs in efficient plants with flexible commitments. Anadarko also processes gas and has interests in three 42 Company operated plants and three non operated plants. Anadarkos strategy to aggregate gas through Company owned and third party gathering systems allows Anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the Company has significant production. Capital Resources and Liquidity General Anadarkos cash flow from operating activities in 2003 was $3.0 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2002 and $3.3 billion in 2001. The increase in 2003 cash flow is attributed primarily to the significant increase in commodity prices. The decrease in 2002 cash flow compared to 2001 is attributed to significantly lower natural gas prices. Fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Companys short term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in the past. Anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk. Anadarkos long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations. The Companys goals include continuing to find high margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices, managing commodity price risk and keeping operating costs at efficient levels. In July 2003, Anadarko implemented a cost reduction plan that eliminated more than $100 million of overhead costs from the Companys annual cost structure, which included cuts in personnel and corporate expenses. This cost reduction plan lowered costs and expenses by $60 million and capitalized overhead costs by $40 million. Restructuring costs associated with this plan are approximately $41 million and charged to income as specific liabilities are incurred. Restructuring costs of $40 million were expensed during 2003. These relate to one time employee termination benefits ($29 million), contract termination costs ($3 million) and other costs ($8 million). The remaining restructuring costs are expected to be paid and expensed in 2004. For additional information on restructuring costs see Note 15 Restructuring Costs of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Debt At year end 2003, Anadarkos total debt was $5.1 billion compared to total debt of $5.5 billion at year end 2002, a decrease of about $400 million. This compares to $5.1 billion at year end 2001. The decrease in debt during 2003 was related primarily to repaying debt that was incurred as a result of the Howell acquisition in late 2002 and repaying Notes that matured in 2003. In March 2001, Anadarko issued $650 million of Zero Yield Puttable Contingent Debt Securities (ZYP CODES) due 2021. In March 2002, ZYP CODES in the amount of $620 million were put to the Company for repayment and were paid in cash. Holders of the remaining ZYP CODES have the right to require Anadarko to purchase all or a portion of their ZYP CODES in March 2004, 2006, 2011 or 2016, at $1,000 per ZYP CODES. In February 2002, the Company issued $650 million principal amount of 5 3/8% Notes due 2007. In March 2002, the Company issued $400 million principal amount of 6 1/8% Notes due 2012. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to reduce floating rate debt and to fund the ZYP CODES put to the Company for repayment in March 2002. In April 2002, Anadarko filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of up to $1 billion in debt securities, preferred stock, preferred securities, depositary shares, common stock, warrants, purchase contracts and purchase units. Net proceeds, terms and pricing of the offerings of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings. After giving effect to the securities issuances described below, the Company may issue, subject to market conditions, up to $350 million in additional securities under this registration statement. In September 2002, Anadarko issued $300 million principal amount of 5% Notes due 2012. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to reduce floating rate debt. These notes were issued under the shelf registration statement filed in April 2002. In April 2003, Anadarko redeemed for cash its callable Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020. Anadarko funded the $384 million redemption with available credit facilities that carried a lower effective interest rate. Anadarko paid $556.46 per debenture, reflecting the issue price plus accrued interest at 3.5%. In May 2003, the Company issued $350 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes due 2008. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce floating rate debt that was incurred in April 2003 to redeem the Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020. These notes were issued under the shelf registration statement filed in April 2002. For additional information on the Companys debt instruments, such as years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 8 Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 43 Capital Expenditures The Company funded its capital investment programs in 2003, 2002 and 2001 primarily through cash flow, plus increases in long term debt and proceeds from property sales. The following table shows the Companys capital expenditures by category. 2003 2002 2001 millions Development $ 1,566 $ 1,079 $ 1,641 Exploration 518 631 846 Acquisitions of oil and gas properties 327 249 198 Gathering and other 73 78 244 Capitalized interest and internal costs related to exploration and development costs 308 351 387 Total * $ 2,792 $ 2,388 $ 3,316 * Excludes corporate acquisitions. Excludes asset retirement costs and includes actual asset retirement expenditures, which is consistent with prior years. Anadarkos total capital spending in 2003 was $2.8 billion, a 17% increase compared to 2002. The increase from 2002 represents a $487 million increase in development spending and a $30 million increase in other spending, partially offset by a $113 million decrease in exploration spending. The increase in development spending and the decrease in exploration spending reflect the Companys decision to direct capital to the areas that have shown the best performance and rate of return, primarily the Lower 48 states, during periods of higher prices. Anadarkos total capital spending in 2002 was $2.4 billion, a 28% decrease compared to 2001. The decrease from 2001 represents a $562 million decrease in development spending, a $215 million decrease in exploration spending and a $151 million decrease in other spending. The decrease in spending for development activities reflects the Companys decision to focus on increasing its inventory of drilling prospects by identifying new reserves through exploration, rather than growing production through development during the down cycle in energy prices in early 2002. Dividends In 2003, Anadarko paid $109 million in dividends to its common stockholders (10 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 14 cents per share in the fourth quarter). In 2002, Anadarko paid $80 million in dividends to its common stockholders (7.5 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter). The dividend amount in 2001 was $57 million (5 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 7.5 cents per share in the fourth quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in 1986. The Companys credit agreement allows for a maximum capitalization ratio of 60% debt, exclusive of the effect of any noncash writedowns. As of December 31, 2003, Anadarkos capitalization ratio was 37% debt. While there is no specific restriction on paying dividends, under the maximum debt capitalization ratio retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends at December 31, 2003. The amount of future common stock dividends will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company also paid $5 million, $6 million and $7 million, respectively, in preferred stock dividends. In 2004, preferred stock dividends are expected to be $5 million. Outlook The Companys 2004 capital expenditure budget has been set between $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion. Anadarko has allocated $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion for worldwide exploration and development. Approximately 80% will be designated for development and about 20% for exploration. The primary focus of the 2004 budget is to direct capital to the areas that have shown the best performance and rate of return. Anadarko made a number of significant discoveries in 2003 and a top priority in 2004 will be to delineate and develop those discoveries. In addition, the Company plans to carry out a focused exploration program in North America, North Africa and the Middle East. Anadarkos overall plan includes about $300 million for capitalized interest and overhead. In conjunction with the cost reduction plan, the Company evaluated the allocation of capital resources to international exploration for 2004. While Management sees an important place for international projects within its portfolio, Anadarko has narrowed the list of international projects in order to better focus its efforts. As a result, the Company expects to work toward divesting its non core assets in Egypt, Australia and Oman during 2004. Net cash flow from operations in 2004 is expected to be in the same range as capital spending and additional borrowings are not anticipated in 2004. The Companys initial capital budget for 2004 is based on estimates of cash 44 flow from operations using prices below January 2004 NYMEX levels. The Company intends to adjust capital expenditures to reflect changes in its cash flow from operations. If higher prices are realized, the Company may expand the drilling program, make targeted acquisitions or further reduce net debt. If commodity prices significantly decrease, the Company may curtail capital spending projects, as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows. The Company has had a stock buyback program to purchase up to $1 billion in shares of Anadarko common stock since 2001. The repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. The Company did not purchase any shares under this program in 2003. To date, the Company has repurchased $166 million of its common stock under this program. No stock purchases have been budgeted for 2004. Both exchange and over the counter traded financial derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements. Margin deposits are required of the Company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits. Given the Companys sizable hedge position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements. During 2003, the Companys margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to $125 million. The Company did not have any margin deposits outstanding at December 31, 2003. Anadarko believes that operating cash flow and existing or available credit facilities will be adequate to meet its capital and operating requirements for 2004. The Company funds its day to day operating expenses and capital expenditures from operating cash flows, supplemented as needed by short term borrowings under commercial paper, money market loans or credit facility borrowings. To facilitate such borrowings, the Company has in place a $750 million committed credit facility, which is supplemented by various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates. As of December 31, 2003, Anadarko had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility. It is the Companys policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may file shelf registrations in advance with the SEC. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property sales and additional borrowing, to secure other funds for additional capital expenditures. At this time, Anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, the Executives and Directors Benefits Trust, the exercise of stock options, the issuance of restricted stock or the Companys Employee Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan equity funded contributions. See Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business for additional information. Obligations and Commitments Following is a summary of the Companys future payments on obligations as of December 31, 2003: Obligations by Period 2 3 4 5 Later 1 Year Years Years Years Total millions Total debt* $ $ 462 $ 1,127 $ 3,613 $ 5,202 Operating leases 57 120 118 103 398 Transportation and storage 41 37 37 108 223 Oil and gas activities 87 87 * Holders of the ZYP CODES due 2021 may put the remaining $30 million principal amount of the ZYP CODES to the Company in 2004. This debt instrument has been reflected in the table above. Operating Leases During 2003, the Companys two corporate office buildings located in The Woodlands, Texas, were acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of a major financial institution from the special purpose entities that had leased the buildings to the Company. The original leases were amended and restated, and, other than the extension of the period of the lease, the terms of the replacement lease between the Company and the real estate development company were essentially unchanged. The total amount funded under the new lease was approximately $214 million. The table above includes lease payment obligations related to this lease under operating leases. 45 In 2002, the Company entered into an agreement under which a floating production platform for its Marco Polo discovery in Green Canyon Block 608 of the Gulf of Mexico will be installed. The agreement requires a monthly demand charge of slightly over $2 million for five years and a processing fee based upon production throughput. Anadarkos commitment to begin payments for the monthly demand charges is incurred upon mechanical completion, which is expected in 2004. The table above includes the payment obligations related to the monthly demand charge for this agreement in operating leases. For additional information see Note 19 Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Oil and Gas Activities As is common in the oil and gas industry, Anadarko has various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. The Company has work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The above table includes drilling and work related commitments of $87 million, comprised of $47 million in Canada, $18 million in Algeria and $22 million in other international locations, that are not included in the 2004 budget. Marketing and Trading Contracts The following tables provide additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio of physical and derivative contracts and the firm transportation keep whole agreement and related derivatives as of December 31, 2003. The Company records income or loss on these activities using the mark to market accounting method. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives are calculated.

Contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are made to fund current period benefit payments. In 2004, the Company expects to contribute between $73 million and $78 million to its funded pension plans, $24 million to its unfunded pension plans and $9 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Future contributions to funded pension plans will be affected by actuarial assumptions, market performance and individual 46 year funding decisions. The Company is unable to accurately predict what contribution levels will be required beyond 2004 for the funded pension plans; however, they are expected to be at levels lower than those made in 2003. The Company expects future payments for other postretirement benefit plans to continue at slightly increasing levels above those made in 2003. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2003, the Companys balance sheet included a $38 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which were incurred by companies that Anadarko has acquired. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information see Environmental and Safety under Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business under Item 7 of this Form 10 K. For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time see Note 3 Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 8 Debt, Note 9 Financial Instruments, Note 20 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans and Note 21 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Financial Statements and Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements, Management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews its estimates, including those related to litigation, environmental liabilities, income taxes and determination of proved reserves. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Properties and Equipment The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the SEC. Under this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003, the carrying amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. The application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and gas properties and mineral investments are amortized using the unit of production method. All other properties are stated at original cost and depreciated on the straight line basis over the useful life of the assets, which ranges from three to 40 years. Proved Reserves Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10(a) (2i), (2ii), (2iii), (3) and (4), are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Companys engineers, are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the DD&A rate calculation and the financial statements. Under the terms of Anadarkos risk service contract with the national oil company of Venezuela, Anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices (economic interest method). This means that higher oil prices reduce the Companys reported production volumes and reserves from that project and lower oil prices increase 47 reported production volumes and reserves. Production volume and reserve changes due to the prices used to determine the Companys economic interest have no impact on the value of the project. Costs Excluded Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects. Anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for that country. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. Costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties. Significant properties, comprised primarily of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks, Alaska, the Land Grant and other international areas, are individually evaluated each quarter by the Companys exploration and engineering staff. Nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the Companys exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling individual wells. The Company has a 10 to 15 year exploration and evaluation program for the Land Grant acreage. Costs are transferred accordingly to the DD&A pool over the length of the program. The Land Grants mineral interests (both working and royalty interests) are owned by the Company in perpetuity. All other significant properties are evaluated over a five to ten year period, depending on the lease term. Insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the United States and Canada. Nonproducing leases are transferred to the DD&A pool over a three to five year period based on the average lease term. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of evaluation. Capitalized Interest SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, provides standards for the capitalization of interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets. Under FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 33 Applying FASB Statement No. 34 to Oil and Gas Producing Operations Accounted for by the Full Cost Method, costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects, on which DD&A expense is not currently taken and on which exploration or development activities are in progress, qualify for capitalization of interest. Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the Companys weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs excluded. Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense. As costs excluded are transferred to the DD&A pool, the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the DD&A pool. Ceiling Test Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10. The ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis. The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of oil and gas properties. That limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges. This ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligation. If the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes and asset retirement obligation exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or noncash writedown is required. A ceiling test impairment can give Anadarko a significant loss for a particular period; however, future DD&A expense would be reduced. Derivative Instruments Anadarko holds derivative instruments for its energy marketing and trading business and to manage foreign currency risk and commodity price risk associated with its equity oil and gas production and the firm transportation keep whole agreement. Anadarko accounts for its derivative instruments under the provisions of SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Under this statement, all derivatives other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Accounting for unrealized gains and losses related to derivatives used to manage foreign currency risk and commodity price risk associated with equity oil and gas production is dependent on whether the derivative instruments have been designated and qualify as part of a hedging relationship. Derivative instruments may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values, cash flows or foreign currencies, if certain conditions are met. If the hedged exposure is to changes in fair value, the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative instrument, as well as the associated losses and gains on the hedged item, are recognized currently in earnings. If the hedged exposure is a cash 48 flow exposure, the effective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into revenues in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gains and losses from the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized currently in other (income) expense. Hedge ineffectiveness is that portion of the fair value change of the hedge that exceeds the fair value change of the hedged item. In those instances where it is probable that a forecasted transaction subject to a cash flow hedge will not occur, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to revenues in the current period. Unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recorded on the basis of whether the hedge is a fair value or cash flow hedge. Unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized currently in revenues. Derivative instruments, including both physical delivery and financially settled purchase and sale contracts, used in the Companys energy marketing and trading activities and the firm transportation keep whole agreement are accounted for under the mark to market accounting method. Under this method, fair value changes are recognized currently in earnings. The marketing and trading margin related to equity production is recorded to gas and oil sales. The non equity portion of the margin is recorded to other sales. Gains and losses related to the firm transportation keep whole agreement are recorded to other (income) expense. Anadarko formally documents the relationship of each hedge to a hedged item including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Each hedge is also routinely assessed for effectiveness. The Companys derivative instruments are generally either exchange traded or valued by reference to a commodity that is traded in a liquid market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data. Option valuations are based on the Black Scholes option pricing model and verified against third party quotations. The fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis prices. Basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the NYMEX gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices, discounted at 10% per year. Management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors (such as expected drilling activity, anticipated pipeline construction projects, expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points, etc.) that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted. Recent Accounting Developments The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) is considering two issues related to the reporting of oil and gas mineral rights. Issue No. 03 O, Whether Mineral Rights Are Tangible or Intangible Assets, is whether or not mineral rights are intangible assets pursuant to SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Issue No. 03 S, Application of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to Oil and Gas Companies, is, if oil and gas drilling rights are intangible assets, whether those assets are subject to the classification and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 142. Anadarko classifies the cost of oil and gas mineral rights as properties and equipment and believes that this is consistent with oil and gas accounting and industry practice. If the EITF determines that oil and gas mineral rights are intangible assets and are subject to the applicable classification and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company estimates that $1.1 billion and $845 million would be reclassified from properties and equipment to intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts represent oil and gas mineral rights acquired after June 2001 through the end of the respective periods. These amounts are net of accumulated DD&A. In addition, the disclosures required by SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 would be made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. There would be no effect on the consolidated statements of income or cash flows as the intangible assets related to oil and gas mineral rights would continue to be amortized under the full cost method of accounting. Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business Forward Looking Statements The Company has made in this report, and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning the Companys operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, 49 contributions from oil and gas properties, and those statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words believes, expects, anticipates, intends, estimates, projects, target, goal, plans, objective, should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10 K and in the Companys other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. Commodity Pricing and Demand Crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide, pricing decisions and production quotas of OPEC and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets. In addition, in OPEC countries in which Anadarko has production such as Algeria, Venezuela and Qatar, when the world oil market is weak, the Company may be subject to periods of decreased production due to government mandated cutbacks. Natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile. In periods of sharply lower commodity prices, the Company may curtail production and capital spending projects, as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows. Changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the Companys determination of proved reserves and the Companys calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves. In addition, demand for oil and gas in the U.S. and worldwide may affect the Companys level of production. Under the full cost method of accounting, a noncash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the Companys oil and gas properties on a country by country basis may be required when prices are low. Whether the Company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter, as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter. While this noncash charge can give Anadarko a significant reported loss for the period, future expenses for DD&A will be reduced. Environmental and Safety The Companys oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the release of emissions into the atmosphere, the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials, offshore oil and gas operations, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the Companys failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the Companys operations. Anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the Companys operations or financial condition in the past. However, because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the Companys operations or financial condition. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the Company is involved, see Note 21 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Exploration and Operating Risks The Companys business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons. As protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, the Company maintains insurance coverage, including certain physical damage, employers liability, comprehensive general liability and workers compensation insurance. Although Anadarko is not insured against all risks in all aspects of its business, such as political risk, business interruption risk and risk of major terrorist attacks, the Company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations. The occurrence of a significant event against which the Company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position. 50 Development Risks The Company is involved in several large development projects. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include: project approvals by joint venture partners; timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies; manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment; and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons. In large development projects, these uncertainties are usually resolved, but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may, therefore, affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects. Domestic Governmental Risks The domestic operations of the Company have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations. Foreign Operations Risk The Companys operations in areas outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include, among other things, loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, insurrection and other political risks, increases in taxes and governmental royalties, renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the Companys international operations. The Companys international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation. To date, the Companys international operations have not been materially affected by these risks. Competition The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. The Companys competitors include major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Some of the Companys competitors may have greater and more diverse resources upon which to draw than does Anadarko. If the Company is not successful in its competition for oil and gas reserves or in its marketing of production, the Companys financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Other Regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells, regulate well spacing, prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters. Operations conducted by the Company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes. Additionally, certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management and the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In addition to the standard permit process, federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan. Any significant increase in costs associated with regulatory compliance or restrictions imposed on the Companys operations by regulation may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Legal Proceedings General The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. The Company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims, including numerous claims by employees of third party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos, silica and benzene while working at a refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, which a company Anadarko acquired by merger in 2000 sold in segments in 1987 and 1989. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, Management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company, although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved. For a description of certain legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10 K. 51 Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Derivative Instruments Anadarkos derivative instruments currently are comprised of futures, swaps and options contracts. The volume of derivative instruments utilized by the Company to hedge its market price risk and in its energy trading operation can vary during the year within the boundaries of its established risk management policy guidelines. For information regarding the Companys accounting policies related to derivatives and additional information related to the Companys derivative instruments, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9 Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Derivative Instruments Held for Non Trading Purposes The Company had equity production hedges of 224 Bcf of natural gas and 26 MMBbls of crude oil as of December 31, 2003 (excluding physical delivery fixed price contracts). As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a net unrealized loss of $242 million before taxes on these commodity derivative instruments. Utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase in commodity prices would result in an additional loss on these commodity derivative instruments of approximately $143 million. However, this loss would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of that portion of the Companys equity production that is hedged. Derivative Instruments Held for Trading Purposes As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a net unrealized gain of $37 million (gains of $70 million and losses of $33 million) on commodity derivative financial instruments entered into for trading purposes and a net unrealized loss of $30 million (gains of $12 million and losses of $42 million) on derivative physical delivery contracts entered into for trading purposes. Utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices, the potential additional loss on the derivative instruments would be approximately $3 million. Firm Transportation Keep Whole Agreement A company Anadarko acquired in 2000 was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its GPM business segment, which was sold in 1999 to Duke. As part of the GPM disposition, Anadarko pays Duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates, while Duke pays Anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates (keep whole agreement). This keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contracts expiration date or February 2009. The Company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure under the keep whole agreement to potential decreases in future transportation market values. Due to decreased liquidity, the use of derivative instruments to manage this risk is generally limited to the forward twelve months. As of December 31, 2003, accounts payable included $27 million and other long term liabilities included $49 million related to this agreement. As of December 31, 2002, accounts payable included $5 million and other long term liabilities included $68 million related to this agreement. A 10% unfavorable change in prices on the short term portion of the keep whole agreement would result in an additional loss of $8 million. The future gain or loss from this agreement cannot be accurately predicted. For additional information related to the keep whole agreement, see Note 9 Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. For additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio and the firm transportation keep whole agreement see Marketing Strategies under Item 7 of this Form 10 K. Interest Rate Risk Anadarko is also exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of the Companys floating rate debt. The Company believes the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of the Companys various debt instruments is not material. Foreign Currency Risk The Companys Canadian subsidiaries use the Canadian dollar as their functional currency. The Companys other international subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. A Canadian subsidiary has notes and debentures denominated in U.S. dollars. The potential foreign currency remeasurement impact on earnings from a 10% increase in the December 31, 2003 Canadian exchange rate would be about $1 million based on the outstanding debt at December 31, 2003. For additional information related to foreign currency risk see Note 9 Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 52
