BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) serve customers in industrial, energy, technology, and healthcare markets. The Company offers a broad portfolio of atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, and equipment and services. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 40 countries, the Company has sales of $8.3 billion, assets of $13.0 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 18,900 employees. The Company organizes its operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. 2009 IN SUMMARY The beginning of fiscal 2009 coincided with the start of the global financial crisis, driving the recession that led to unprecedented declines in demand for the Companys products worldwide. The downturn in the economy affected customers operating rates across most of our end markets. Globally, manufacturing declined 11%, and in Electronics, silicon processed decreased by about 35%. In response to these rapidly declining economic conditions around the world and to drive to a sustainable, low cost structure, the Company implemented a global cost reduction plan. Impacted by these factors, the Companys sales and operating income declined 21% and 43%, respectively. Additionally, unfavorable currency impacts, due to a stronger U.S. dollar contributed to the decline. The 2009 global cost reduction plan included the elimination of about 12% of the global workforce along with business exits and asset management actions. These initiatives lowered the Companys cost structure, especially in the second half of the year. The planned actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2010. Also, the Company implemented price increases and executed its initiatives for cost improvement by lowering discretionary spending. Sales were sequentially higher in the fourth quarter, and there was a greater than 200 basis point increase in the Companys operating margin in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Overall, fiscal 2009 was a challenging year due to the impact of the global recession, but the actions taken by the Company helped to mitigate the adverse impact. 17 Table of Contents Highlights for 2009 The Company implemented a global cost reduction plan designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses with the contracting global economy. Results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after tax, or $.94 per share) for this plan. The Company completed the divestiture of the U.S. Healthcare business. The Company maintained a solid financial position throughout 2009. The current credit environment did not have a significant adverse impact on the Companys liquidity. Sales of $8,256.2 declined 21%. Underlying business declined 8% from lower volumes. Lower energy and raw material cost pass through to customers and unfavorable currency negatively impacted sales by 7% and 6%, respectively. Operating income of $846.3 declined $649.5, principally from lower volumes, the global cost reduction plan charge, and unfavorable currency impacts. Income from continuing operations was $639.9 as compared to $1,090.5. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $3.00 as compared to $4.97. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below. Loss from discontinued operations was $8.6 as compared to $180.8. The prior year included an after tax impairment charge of $246.2 related to the U.S. Healthcare business and an after tax gain of $76.2 from the sale of the Polymer Emulsions business. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to the Companys 2010 Outlook discussions provided throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis that follows.

The Company anticipates global manufacturing growth of 1% 2% in 2010. In the U.S., growth is expected to be flat to slightly positive by 1%. Europe is expected to be flat. Asia, led by China, is expected to be the strongest region, growing at a projected 6% 7%. Looking forward, the Company will continue to focus on improving its operating margin and return on capital through volume growth, effective cost management, and implementation of price increases. Capacity utilization rates in 2010 should improve as the economy recovers and through expansion of technology applications. Earnings should benefit from new plant startups in 2009 and 2010 along with a full year impact of the 2009 global cost reduction plan. The Company will also remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs, and staffing. However, pension expense will be higher next year as a result of a decline in the discount rates used to determine the 2010 expense. Outlook by Segment The Company is projecting Merchant Gases results to be higher based on a modest recovery in global manufacturing. Margins should improve based on higher volumes and cost reduction efforts. In 2009, the segment took steps to restructure the organization and to reduce costs in order to drive productivity and growth. Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from new contracts and plants coming on stream, and increased capacity utilization as chemical and steel markets continue to recover. In Electronics, the Company projects silicon growth of 10% 15%, higher demand from flat panel producers, and accelerated growth in thin film photovoltaic. The business repositioning efforts should result in additional ongoing restructuring costs, while price pressure for certain electronics materials is expected to remain until capacity utilization improves. Growth is anticipated in Performance Materials as the Company should continue to benefit from new market and application successes, regional investment, and new product introductions. Equipment and Energy results are expected to be comparable to 2009 levels. Two to three LNG orders are expected to be signed in fiscal 2010. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 8,256.2 $ 10,414.5 $ 9,148.2 Operating income 846.3 1,495.8 1,375.6 Equity affiliates income 112.2 145.0 114.4 Sales % Change from Prior Year 2009 2008 Underlying business Volume (9 )% 2 % Price 1 % 2 % Acquisitions/divestitures 1 % Currency (6 )% 4 % Energy and raw material cost pass through (7 )% 5 % Total Consolidated Sales Change (21 )% 14 % 2009 vs. 2008 Sales of $8,256.2 decreased 21%, or $2,158.3. Underlying business declined 8%, due to lower volumes primarily in Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases, and Tonnage Gases. Volumes were impacted by the severity of the worldwide manufacturing downturn and a significant decline in silicon processed. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 6%, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass through to customers reduced sales by 7%. 19 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Sales of $10,414.5 increased 14%, or $1,266.3. Underlying base business growth accounted for 4% of the increase. Sales increased 2% as higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases, and Tonnage Gases were partially offset by lower Equipment and Energy activity. Improved pricing, principally in Merchant Gases, increased sales by 2%. Sales improved 4% from favorable currency effects, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass through to customers increased sales by 5%. Operating Income 2009 vs. 2008 Operating income of $846.3 decreased 43%, or $649.5. The global cost reduction plan charge reduced operating income by $298. Underlying business declined $254, due primarily to lower volumes in the Merchant Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Tonnage Gases segments. The volume declines of $490 were partially offset by favorable cost performance of $157 and improved pricing of $79. Unfavorable currency impacts lowered operating income by $113, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. The write off of certain receivables due to a customer bankruptcy and asset actions reduced operating income by $32. Lower pension settlement charges favorably impacted operating income by $20. Prior year operating income included unfavorable impacts of $28 due to hurricanes and a fire at a production facility. 2008 vs. 2007 Operating income of $1,495.8 increased 9%, or $120.2. Higher volumes in the Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, and Electronics and Performance Materials segments, partially offset by a decrease in Equipment and Energy activity, increased operating income by $82. Improved pricing, net of variable costs, increased operating income by $21, as pricing increases in Merchant Gases were partially offset by lower pricing in electronics specialty materials. Favorable currency effects, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, increased operating income by $80. 2007 included a gain of $37 from a settlement of a supply contract termination. Higher pension settlement charges negatively impacted operating income by $20. Unfavorable impacts caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and the fire at an Electronics production facility in Korea, decreased operating income by $28. Equity Affiliates Income 2009 vs. 2008 Income from equity affiliates of $112.2 decreased $32.8, or 23%, primarily as a result of lower overall volumes and unfavorable currency. Additionally, prior year results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. 2008 vs. 2007 Income from equity affiliates of $145.0 increased $30.6, or 27%. This increase resulted from solid underlying growth, increased nitrogen injection volumes in Mexico, the benefit of adjustments to certain affiliates, and the reversal of an antitrust fine. 20 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expense (SA) 2009 vs. 2008 SA expense of $943.4 decreased $147.0, or 13%. Underlying costs decreased 8%, primarily due to improved productivity as well as the impact of the global cost reduction plan, lower incentive compensation costs, and lower discretionary spending. This decrease was partially offset by inflation and higher bad debt expense. Favorable currency impacts, primarily the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling, decreased SA by 6%. The acquisition of CryoService Limited in the third quarter of 2008 increased SA by 1%. SA as a percent of sales, increased to 11.4% from 10.5%, due principally to the impact of lower energy and raw material cost pass through on sales. 2008 vs. 2007 SA expense of $1,090.4 increased 9%, or $90.6. SA increased 2% from the acquisition of the Polish industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z o.o. (BOC Gazy) in the third quarter of 2007. Currency effects, driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, increased SA by 4%. Underlying costs increased SA by 3%, as productivity gains were more than offset by inflation and higher costs to support growth. SA as a percent of sales declined to 10.5% from 10.9%. 2010 Outlook SA expense for 2010 will reflect higher pension expense and modest cost inflation. These increases should be offset by cost savings arising from the benefits of the global cost reduction plan initiated in 2009 and ongoing productivity initiatives. Research and Development (RD) 2009 vs. 2008 RD expense of $116.3 decreased $14.4, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. RD increased as a percent of sales to 1.4% from 1.3%. 2008 vs. 2007 RD expense of $130.7 increased $1.7. RD decreased as a percent of sales to 1.3% from 1.4%. 2010 Outlook RD expense is expected to be moderately higher in 2010. Global Cost Reduction Plan 2009 The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after tax, or $.94 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company announced the global cost reduction plan, designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. In the third quarter of 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, the Company committed to additional actions associated with its global cost reduction plan. The 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension related costs, associated with the elimination of approximately 2,550 positions from the Companys global workforce. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. Cost savings of approximately $50 were realized in 2009, and cost savings of approximately $155 are expected for 2010. Beyond 2010, the Company expects annualized savings of approximately $180, of which the majority is related to personnel costs. 2007 The 2007 results from continuing operations included a charge of $13.7 ($8.8 after tax, or $.04 per share) for a global cost reduction plan. The charge included $6.5 for severance and pension related costs for the elimination of approximately 125 positions and $7.2 for the write down of certain investments. As of 30 September 2008, the actions associated with the 2007 charge were complete. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these charges. 21 Table of Contents 2007 Customer Contract Settlement In 2007, the Company entered into a settlement with a customer to resolve a dispute related to a dinitrotoluene (DNT) supply agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, the DNT supply agreement was terminated, and certain other agreements between the companies were amended. As a result, the Company recognized a before tax gain of $36.8 ($23.6 after tax, or $.11 per share). 2009 Customer Bankruptcy and Asset Actions In 2009, the Company recognized charges totaling $32.1 ($21.0 after tax, or $.10 per share) related to a customer bankruptcy and asset actions for the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension Settlement The Companys supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participants retirement date. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. Based on the timing of when cash payments were made, the Company recognized $10.7, $30.3, and $10.3 of settlement charges in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Income, Net Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to the principal income earning activities of the Company. The detail of other income is presented in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2009 vs. 2008 Other income of $23.0 decreased by $2.8. Other income declined due to losses from asset sales in the current year and unfavorable foreign exchange. Other income in 2008 included a loss related to fire damage at a production facility. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. 2008 vs. 2007 Other income of $25.8 decreased by $16.5. Other income in 2008 included a loss of $14.7 related to fire damage at an Electronics production facility in Korea, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange of $8.1. Other income in 2007 included a gain of $23.7 on the sale of assets. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest incurred $ 143.8 $ 184.1 $ 175.3 Less: Capitalized interest 21.9 22.1 12.9 Interest Expense $ 121.9 $ 162.0 $ 162.4 2009 vs. 2008 Interest incurred decreased by $40.3. This decrease was primarily driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt. The impact of a stronger dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest was offset by a higher average debt balance. Capitalized interest was comparable to the prior year due to slightly higher project levels offset by lower average interest rates. 2008 vs. 2007 Interest incurred increased by $8.8. The increase resulted from a higher average debt balance, excluding currency effects, and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Capitalized interest increased by $9.2, primarily due to increased project levels in the Tonnage Gases segment. 2010 Outlook The Company expects interest incurred to be modestly higher. This increase is expected to result from a higher average debt balance and higher expected average interest rates. 22 Table of Contents Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes, less minority interest. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2009 vs. 2008 The effective tax rate was 22.5% and 25.1% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate declined, as tax credits had a higher relative impact due to lower book taxable income. 2008 vs. 2007 The effective tax rate was 25.1% and 22.0% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. A tax benefit associated with foreign operations and other higher credits and adjustments from the Companys ongoing tax planning process were included in the 2008 effective rate. The 2007 tax rate included the settlement of tax audits and related interest income, combined with the donation of a portion of a cost based investment. The net impact was a 3.1% higher tax rate in 2008. 2010 Outlook The Company expects the effective tax rate in 2010 to be approximately 25.5% to 26.0%. Discontinued Operations The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. U.S. Healthcare In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write down of the net carrying value of the U.S. Healthcare business. In the first half of 2009, based on additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after tax, or $.15 per share), reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the business. Also, tax benefits of $25.5, or $.12 per share, were recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit associated with the total impairment charges recorded. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company sold more than half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business to OptionCare Enterprises, Inc., a subsidiary of Walgreen Co., and Landauer Metropolitan, Inc. (LMI) for combined cash proceeds of $38.1. The Company recognized an after tax gain of $.3 resulting from these sales combined with adjustments to the net realizable value of the remaining businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions with Rotech Healthcare, Inc. and with LMI, the Company sold its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after tax loss of $.7 was recognized. These transactions completed the disposal of the U.S. Healthcare business. The U.S. Healthcare business generated sales of $125.2, $239.8, and $271.1, and a loss from operations, net of tax, of $3.4, $259.4, and $15.2 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The loss from operations in 2008 included an after tax impairment charge of $237.0. Polymer Emulsions Business On 31 January 2008, the Company closed on the sale of its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long time joint venture partner. As part of that agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AGs interest in the Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $89.5 ($57.7 after tax, or $.26 per share). On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland, Inc. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5 after tax, or $.08 per share) in connection with the sale, which included the recording of a retained environmental obligation associated with the Piedmont site. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Companys Polymer Emulsions business. 23 Table of Contents The Polymer Emulsion business generated sales of $261.4 and $618.6, and income from operations, net of tax, of $11.3 and $38.3 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. HPPC Business In 2008, the Company sold its HPPC business to KMG Chemicals, Inc. The Company wrote down the assets of the business to net realizable value as of 30 September 2007, resulting in a loss of $15.3 ($9.3 after tax, or $.04 per share). The sale closed on 31 December 2007, and an additional loss on the sale was recorded of $.5 ($.3 after tax) in 2008. The HPPC business generated sales of $22.9 and $87.2 and income from operations, net of tax, of $.1 and $2.2 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net Income 2009 vs. 2008 Net income was $631.3, compared to $909.7 in 2008. Diluted earnings per share was $2.96 compared to $4.15 in 2008.

Sales decreased 9% from unfavorable currency effects, driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Underlying sales declined 5%, with volumes down 9% and pricing up 4%. Volumes were weak across manufacturing end markets globally. Price increases implemented early in the year were effective, partially offsetting the decline in volume. The global recession significantly impacted manufacturing related demand for Merchant industrial gases in every region. In North America, sales decreased 10%, with volumes down 14%. Higher pricing of 4% partially offset the decline in volumes. In Europe, sales decreased 17%, primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts of 13%. Underlying sales declined 4%, with volumes down 8% and pricing adding 4%. Stronger healthcare volumes partially offset the total volume decline. In Asia, sales declined 13%. Underlying sales were lower by 6%, with volumes declining 8% and pricing adding 2%. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 7%. 24 Table of Contents Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $661.2 decreased 16%, or $128.3. The decline was due to reduced volumes of $234 and unfavorable currency impacts of $74. These declines were partially offset by improved pricing, net of variable costs, of $102 and improved cost performance of $78, primarily due to cost reduction efforts. Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates Income Merchant Gases equity affiliates income of $98.3 decreased 25%, or $33.5. The decline was a result of lower overall volumes and unfavorable currency. Additionally, prior year results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. 2008 vs. 2007 Merchant Gases Sales Sales of $4,192.7 increased 18%, or $635.8. Higher volumes across all regions increased sales by 4%. Volumes increased in North America due to record new signings in 2008 and continued strong demand for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid nitrogen (LIN). Volume gains in Europe were primarily due to a higher number of Healthcare patients served. In Asia, volumes were higher in generated gases, liquid argon, and liquid helium. Higher prices increased sales by 4% as a result of actions taken to recover higher power, distribution, and other manufacturing costs in North America and Europe. Sales increased by 3% from the full year impact of the acquisition of BOC Gazy in 2007. In addition, sales increased 7% due to favorable currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $789.5 increased by 20%, or $133.1. Favorable operating income variances resulted from improved pricing of $75, higher volumes of $60, and currency effects of $51. Operating income declined by $49 from higher distribution costs and inflation. Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates Income Equity affiliates income of $131.8 increased 35%, or $34.0, reflecting higher income in all regions. The increases were due to solid underlying growth, increased nitrogen injection volumes in Mexico, and the benefit of adjustments to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. Tonnage Gases 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 2,573.6 $ 3,574.4 $ 2,936.7 Operating income 399.6 482.6 426.4 Tonnage Gases Sales % Change from Prior Year 2009 2008 Underlying business Volume (5 )% 2 % Acquisitions/divestitures 1 % Currency (4 )% 3 % Energy and raw material cost pass through (19 )% 16 % Total Tonnage Gases Sales Change (28 )% 22 % 2009 vs. 2008 Tonnage Gases Sales Sales of $2,573.6 decreased 28%, or $1,000.8. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass through to customers reduced sales by 19%. Volumes were down 5%. While refinery hydrogen volumes were higher, overall volumes declined from reduced demand from steel and chemical customers. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 4%. 25 Table of Contents Tonnage Gases Operating Income Operating income of $399.6 decreased 17%, or $83.0. Underlying business declined $70, primarily from decreased volumes and lower operating efficiencies. Currency unfavorably impacted operating income by $24. Prior year included unfavorable hurricane related impacts of $11. 2008 vs. 2007 Tonnage Gases Sales Sales of $3,574.4 increased 22%, or $637.7. Higher energy and raw material cost pass through accounted for 16% of sales growth in 2008. Volume growth in the underlying business increased sales by 4%, primarily due to new plant start ups in Asia and Canada, offset by a decline of 2% due to the impacts from hurricane related business interruption. The acquisition of BOC Gazy in the third quarter of 2007 improved sales by 1%. Sales increased 3% from favorable currency effects, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Tonnage Gases Operating Income Operating income of $482.6 increased 13%, or $56.2. Operating income increased by $20 from higher volumes, $9 from favorable currency effects, and $30 from lower operating costs. Operating income decreased by $11 as a result of hurricane related impacts. Electronics and Performance Materials 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 1,582.2 $ 2,209.3 $ 2,068.7 Operating income 101.6 245.9 229.2 Electronics and Performance Materials Sales % Change from Prior Year 2009 2008 Underlying business Volume (25 )% 5 % Price (2 )% Acquisition/divestiture 1 % Currency (2 )% 2 % Total Electronics and Performance Materials Sales Change (28 )% 7 % 2009 vs. 2008 Electronics and Performance Materials Sales Sales of $1,582.2 declined 28%, or $627.1, as volumes declined 25%. Sales volumes declined significantly in the first half of 2009 and recovered sequentially in the second half. In Electronics, sales were down 35%, reflecting a significant global downturn in semiconductor and flat panel capacity utilization and capital investment. In Performance Materials, sales were down 19% due to weaker demand across all end markets, partially offset by improved pricing. Electronics and Performance Materials Operating Income Operating income of $101.6 declined by 59%, or $144.3. Operating income declined from lower volumes of $202 as well as unfavorable pricing of $37. Lower pricing in Electronics was partially offset by higher pricing in Performance Materials. Favorable cost performance added $82, primarily due to cost reduction efforts. Results in 2008 included $15 of unfavorable impacts associated with a fire at a production facility. 2008 vs. 2007 Electronics and Performance Materials Sales Sales of $2,209.3 increased 7%, or $140.6. Underlying base business growth increased sales by 5%. In Electronics, higher volumes in specialty materials and tonnage gases were partially offset by lower equipment sales and softer volumes due to product rationalization. Higher volumes across Asia and in some key market segments in North America increased sales in Performance Materials. Pricing was flat, as improvements in Performance Materials were offset by lower pricing in electronic specialty materials. Favorable currency effects, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies, improved sales by 2%. 26 Table of Contents Electronics and Performance Materials Operating Income Operating income of $245.9 increased 7%, or $16.7. Operating income increased $48 from higher volumes, $19 from lower operating costs, and $18 from favorable currency effects, partially offset by property damage of $15 caused by a fire at an Electronics production facility in Korea. Operating income also declined by $51 from lower electronic specialty materials pricing, net of variable costs. Equipment and Energy 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 489.8 $ 438.1 $ 585.9 Operating income 42.2 38.9 76.8 2009 vs. 2008 Sales of $489.8 increased by 12%, or $51.7, due to higher air separation unit (ASU) activity. Operating income improved $3.3 from favorable cost performance and higher ASU sales, partially offset by lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchanger activity and unfavorable currency. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2009 was $239, compared to $399 at 30 September 2008. It is expected that approximately $203 of the backlog will be completed during 2010. 2008 vs. 2007 Sales of $438.1 decreased by 25%, or $147.8, primarily from lower LNG activity and a one time energy related equipment sale that occurred in 2007. Operating income of $38.9 decreased by $37.9, primarily from lower LNG heat exchanger activity. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2008 was $399, compared to $258 at 30 September 2007. Other Other operating income (loss) includes expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income, and costs previously allocated to businesses now reported as discontinued operations. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate general and administrative costs and research and development costs are fully allocated to the business segments. 2009 2008 2007 Operating (loss) $ (17.3 ) $ (30.8 ) $ (26.0 ) 2009 vs. 2008 Operating loss of $17.3 decreased by $13.5. The decrease is primarily due to favorable LIFO inventory adjustments versus the prior year. Unfavorable currency partially offset this decline. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. 2008 vs. 2007 Operating loss of $30.8 increased by $4.8. No items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. 27 Table of Contents PENSION BENEFITS The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans the U.S. Salaried Pension Plan and the U.K. Pension Plan were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. The move to defined contribution plans has not had a material impact on retirement program cost levels or funding. Over the long run, however, the new defined contribution plans are expected to reduce volatility of both expense and contributions. For 2009, the fair market value of pension plan assets for the Companys defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $2,251.0 from $2,218.2 in 2008. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $3,386.0 and $2,731.7 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the obligation was due principally to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to measure future benefit obligations to 5.6% from 7.1%. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on the Companys postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2009 2008 2007 Pension expense $ 110.0 $ 127.0 $ 138.5 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 43.8 31.5 12.3 Weighted average discount rate 7.1 % 6.1 % 5.7 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 8.3 % 8.8 % 8.8 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 4.3 % 4.2 % 4.1 % 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in pension expense was primarily attributable to the 100 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate. Expense in 2009 included $43.8 of special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges, of which $32.3 was related to the global cost reduction plan. 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in pension expense was primarily attributable to the 40 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate. Expense included $31.5 in 2008 and $12.3 in 2007 for special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges. 2010 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $125 in 2010, an increase of $15. Expense in 2009 included $43.8 of special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges. In 2010, pension expense will include approximately $64 for amortization of actuarial losses versus $17 in 2009. Actuarial losses of $739.2 were incurred in 2009, resulting primarily from a lower discount rate used to determine the 2010 expense and actual asset returns below expected returns. Actuarial gains/losses, in excess of certain thresholds, are amortized into pension expense over the average remaining service lives of the employees to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2010. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, the Companys funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, the Company makes contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing its capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. The Company analyzes the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2009 and 2008, the Companys cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans were $184.8 and $234.0, respectively. The majority of the cash contributions were voluntary. Cash contributions and benefit payments for defined benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $360 in 2010. Of this amount, $200 has been contributed in October 2009. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 33 for a projection of future contributions. 28 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. The Companys accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations on an after tax basis related to environmental matters totaled $32.6, $31.0, and $25.1 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, the Company estimates that in 2009, it spent approximately $6 on capital projects to control pollution versus $7 in 2008. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $7 in both 2010 and 2011. The Company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $95 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $109. The balance sheet at 30 September 2009 and 2008 included an accrual of $95.0 and $82.9, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and the Paulsboro, New Jersey facilities is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of the Companys operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in California and Ontario. In the U.S., regional initiatives have been implemented that will regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel driven power plants, and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants. As a large consumer of electric power, the Company could be impacted by increased costs that may arise from such regulatory controls. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced in the U.S. that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions from the Companys hydrogen facilities and other operations, such as production of fluorinated gases manufactured by the Company. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHGs. The Company may incur costs related to GHG emissions from its hydrogen facilities and other operations such as fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate prediction of the long term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from Company facilities could impact the Companys growth by increasing its operating costs or reducing demand for certain of its products. Regulation of GHGs may also produce new opportunities for the Company. The Company continues to develop technologies to help its facilities and its customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. The Company is also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and the Companys carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of the Companys main products, and the Companys proprietary technology for delivering low cost oxygen. 29 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company maintained a solid financial position throughout 2009. Cash flow from operations, supplemented with proceeds from borrowings, provided funding for the Companys capital spending and dividend payments. The Company continues to maintain debt ratings of A/A2 (long term) and A 1/P 1 (short term), by Standard Poors/Moodys and retained consistent access to commercial paper markets throughout the year. The Companys cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table: 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,322.9 $ 1,679.6 $ 1,499.9 Investing activities (1,040.4 ) (919.8 ) (1,483.1 ) Financing activities 101.5 (698.5 ) (14.9 ) Operating Activities 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $356.7, or 21%. The decrease resulted from the reduction in net income of $278.4 combined with the unfavorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $170.7, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $92.4. Noncash adjustments include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, and share based compensation cost. These adjustments also include changes in operating assets, such as noncurrent capital lease receivables, and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt or disbursement of cash and their recognition in earnings. Net income in 2009 included noncash impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, U.S. Healthcare noncash impairment charges totaling $314.8 were partially offset by gains of $105.9 on the sale of discontinued operations. Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses are reflected as an investing activity. Changes in working capital decreased cash used (positive cash flow variance) by $92.4 and included: A $256.4 positive cash flow variance due to lower trade receivables as a result of lower sales. A $108.7 positive cash flow variance from other receivables due primarily to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 2008 related to the U.S. Healthcare impairment charge. The recognition of this asset represented a use of cash in 2008. A $319.0 negative cash flow variance due to a higher use of cash for payables and accrued liabilities. This variance was due to a lower level of activity and the timing of payments. 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $179.7, or 12%. The increase resulted principally from a decrease in the use of cash for working capital of $218.1. The decline in net income of $125.9 was offset by the favorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $87.5. Net income in 2008 included a noncash impairment charge of $314.8 related to the U.S. Healthcare business. Net income in 2008 also included a gain of $105.9 related to the sale of discontinued operations, and adjustments to income included an increase in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $121.8. Changes in working capital decreased cash used (positive cash flow variance) by $218.1 and included: A $255.7 positive cash flow variance for payables and accrued liabilities due mainly to an increase in customer advances related to equipment sales, lower pension plan contributions, and the timing of payments. A $156.5 positive cash flow variance due to a reduction in contracts in progress resulting from lower equipment activity. A $97.2 negative cash flow variance from higher trade receivables due primarily to higher sales, offset partially by increased collections. A $77.5 negative cash flow variance from other receivables resulting from the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the U.S. Healthcare impairment charge. 30 Table of Contents Investing Activities 2009 vs. 2008 Cash used for investing increased $120.6, primarily from lower proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $372.0, partially offset by changes in restricted cash of $270.6. During 2009, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. Healthcare business, which generated proceeds of $51.0. Prior year proceeds of $423.0 included the sales of the Polymer Emulsions and HPPC businesses. Decreases in the restricted cash balances, caused by project spending exceeding new bond proceeds, resulted in a source of cash of $87.0 in 2009. Prior year activity resulted in a use of cash of $183.6. The proceeds from the issuance of certain Industrial Revenue Bonds must be held in escrow until related project spending occurs and are classified as noncurrent assets in the balance sheet. 2008 vs. 2007 Cash used for investing decreased $563.3, principally from lower acquisitions of $467.1 and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $423.0, partially offset by changes in restricted cash of $183.6. Additionally, the proceeds from asset sales declined $77.6. In 2007, the Company acquired BOC Gazy from The Linde Group for 380 million, or $518.4. During 2008, the Company sold its Polymer Emulsions and HPPC businesses. Additions to restricted cash, from the proceeds of bonds held in escrow, resulted in a use of cash of $183.6. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2009 2008 2007 Additions to plant and equipment $ 1,179.1 $ 1,085.1 $ 1,013.2 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 32.7 72.0 539.1 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 24.5 2.2 .2 Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis $ 1,236.3 $ 1,159.3 $ 1,552.5 Capital lease expenditures (A) 238.6 195.7 82.8 Capital expenditures on a non GAAP basis $ 1,474.9 $ 1,355.0 $ 1,635.3 (A) The Company utilizes a non GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Companys management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Companys expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2009 totaled $1,236.3, compared to $1,159.3 in 2008. Additions to plant and equipment in 2009 increased by $94.0 compared to 2008. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2009 and 2008. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Capital expenditures on a non GAAP basis in 2009 totaled $1,474.9, compared to $1,355.0 in 2008. Capital lease expenditures of $238.6 increased by $42.9, reflecting increased expenditures primarily in North America Tonnage Gases. In 2008, capital lease expenditures of $195.7 increased $112.9 from 2007, reflecting higher project spending, primarily in Europe and Asia. 2010 Outlook Capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2010 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,000 and $1,200, and on a non GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,300 and $1,500. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with approximately $1,000 associated with new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, the Company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. 31 Table of Contents Financing Activities 2009 vs. 2008 Cash provided by financing activities increased $800.0, primarily as a result of share repurchases of $793.4 in 2008. In 2009, the Company did not purchase any of its outstanding shares. 2008 vs. 2007 Cash used for financing activities increased $683.6, primarily due to: A net decrease in borrowings of $299.5. Company borrowings (short and long term proceeds, net of repayments) totaled $305.5 as compared to $605.0. An increase in cash used for the purchase of treasury stock of $218.2. Lower proceeds of $115.4 from stock option exercises. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2009 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2009, total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion compared to $4.0 billion, and cash and cash items were $.5 billion compared to $.1 billion. Total debt at 30 September 2009 and 2008, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt, shareholders equity, and minority interest, was 47.7% and 43.4%, respectively. Long term debt proceeds of $610.5 included $400.0 from the issuance of a fixed rate 4.375% 10 year senior note and $158.8 from Industrial Revenue Bonds. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In September 2008, the Company increased the size of its multicurrency committed revolving credit facility, maturing May 2011, from $1,200 to $1,450. Fifteen major global banks provide commitments under this facility, and the Company is confident that funding would be available from these banks if it were necessary to draw on the facility. As of 30 September 2009, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. Additional commitments of $396.6 are maintained by the Companys foreign subsidiaries, of which $294.8 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2009. There was no commercial paper outstanding at 30 September 2009. On 20 September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Companys outstanding common stock. During 2009, the Company did not purchase any shares under this authorization. At 30 September 2009, $649.2 in share repurchase authorization remained. 2010 Outlook The Company projects a limited need to access the long term debt markets in 2010 due to its projected operating cash flows and its available cash balance at the end of 2009. The Company expects that it will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short term debt markets. Dividends On 19 March 2009, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.44 per share to $.45 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. 32 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long term obligations. The following table summarizes these obligations of the Company as of 30 September 2009: Payments Due By Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Long term debt obligations Debt maturities $ 4,159 $ 452 $ 193 $ 455 $ 310 $ 469 $ 2,280 Contractual interest 765 128 122 108 88 69 250 Capital leases 11 3 2 1 1 1 3 Operating leases 227 58 45 32 26 22 44 Pension obligations 1,144 360 145 75 80 150 334 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,785 611 120 112 115 120 707 Total Contractual Obligations $ 8,091 $ 1,612 $ 627 $ 783 $ 620 $ 831 $ 3,618 Long Term Debt Obligations The long term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on long term debt. Contractual interest is the interest the Company is contracted to pay on the long term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. The Company had $1,413 of long term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2009, excluding fixed rate debt that has been swapped to variable rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2009. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short term tax exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Most of the Companys long term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long term take or pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, the Company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The above unconditional purchase obligations include other product supply commitments and also electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $369 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2010. The Company also purchases materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements type contracts at market prices. In total, purchases by the Company approximate $6.4 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. 33 Table of Contents Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2009 were $357.9. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2009 were $194.9. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. The Company does not have any derivative instruments indexed to its own stock. The Companys off balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Companys principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. The Company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arms length with clearly independent parties. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is the Companys policy to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. The Company mitigates adverse energy price impacts through its cost pass through contracts with customers, as well as price increases. The Company has entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil based feedstocks. The Company addresses these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys derivative and other financial instruments consist of long term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange option contracts, and commodity swaps. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position. The net financial instrument position does not include other investments of $19.4 at 30 September 2009 and $15.6 at 30 September 2008 as disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At 30 September 2009 and 2008, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $4,510 and $3,629, respectively. The increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the issuance of new long term debt and the impact of lower interest rates on the market value of long term debt. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Companys financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects the Companys view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by the Company using a third party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. 34 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The Companys debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of 30 September 2009 primarily comprised debt denominated in Euros (49%) and U.S. dollars (37%), including the effect of currency swaps. This debt portfolio is composed of 55% fixed rate debt and 45% variable rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of the Companys debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the Companys debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2009, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2009. Based on the variable rate debt included in the Companys debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, as of 30 September 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decline in interest rates would result in an additional $20 of interest incurred or lower interest incurred by $20, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2009, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $369 in the net liability position of financial instruments. The primary currencies for which the Company has exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the U.S. dollar versus the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where the Company does business, thereby reducing its net asset exposure. Foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge the Companys firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows, along with foreign exchange option contracts. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal (or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchange option contracts) to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. Commodity Price Risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 50% change in the price of natural gas and oil based feedstocks, at 30 September 2009, with all other variables held constant. The impact of a 50% change in these prices would not have a significant impact on the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2009. INFLATION The financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation. While the U.S. inflation rate has been modest for several years, the Company operates in many countries with both inflation and currency issues. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing the Companys plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the Companys major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Companys accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires managements significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. The Companys management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with its audit committee. 35 Table of Contents Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2009 totaled $6,859.6, and depreciation expense totaled $815.9 during 2009. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. The Company has numerous long term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease Life Increase Life By 1 Year By 1 Year Merchant Gases $ 20 $ (16 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $ 15 $ (13 ) Impairment of Long Lived Assets Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2009 totaled $6,859.6. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset groups fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset groups fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 36 Table of Contents The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent managements best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The purchase method of accounting for business combinations currently requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $56.1, was $972.1 as of 30 September 2009. The majority of the Companys goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires the Company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. The Company has designated its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, the Company has four business segments and fifteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. There were no indications of impairment. The Company primarily uses an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine fair value of a reporting unit. The Companys valuation model uses a five year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by the Companys reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in the Companys income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in the Companys operating plan and long term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets at 30 September 2009 totaled $262.6 and consisted primarily of customer relationships that were acquired as part of business combinations. The Company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $868.1 at 30 September 2009. The majority of the Companys investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. 37 Table of Contents In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Managements estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2009, accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities amounted to $42.9 and $357.9, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2009 were $194.9. Current and noncurrent deferred tax assets equaled $278.1 at 30 September 2009. Income tax expense was $185.3 for the year ended 30 September 2009. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in the Companys effective tax rate would have decreased/increased net income by approximately $8. Pension Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. The Company determines assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. The Company believes the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. For the U.S. Plans, the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate. In making this determination, the Company considers the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve, the general movement of interest rates, and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond 38 Table of Contents yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $20 per year. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of long term returns of major asset classes. In determining asset class returns, the Company takes into account long term returns of major asset classes, historical performance of plan assets, and related value added of active management, as well as the current interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined by an asset/ liability study that takes into account plan demographics, asset returns, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. The Company uses a market related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market related value of assets. This method recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year to year volatility. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market related value of assets over the five year period. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. The Company determines this rate based on review of the underlying long term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business the Company encounters contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the Company. The Company accrues a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which the Companys accounting policy is discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and particulars are provided in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or the Companys proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on the Companys net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the Companys implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. 39 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This document contains forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
