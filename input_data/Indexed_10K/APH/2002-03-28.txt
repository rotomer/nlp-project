ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained herein. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the components of net income before extraordinary item as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 63.8 65.2 65.7 Depreciation and amortization expense 2.9 2.1 2.8 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.1 13.7 14.4 Amortization of goodwill 1.3 1.0 1.2 Operating income 17.9 18.0 15.9 Interest expense (5.1) (4.6) (7.9) Other expenses, net (.5) (.7) (.5) Income before income taxes and extraordinary item 12.3 12.7 7.5 Provision for income taxes (4.7) (4.8) (3.1) Net income before extraordinary item 7.6% 7.9% 4.4% 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Net sales were $1,103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1,359.7 million for 2000. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 10% compared to 2000 ($906.8 million in 2001 versus $1,009.2 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace and automotive markets. Sales of cable products decreased 44% compared to 2000 ($197.0 million in 2001 versus $350.5 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by certain U.S. and international cable television operators. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2001 decreased approximately 22% compared to 2000 ($538.3 million in 2001 versus $690.7 million in 2000); international sales for 2001, including export sales, decreased approximately 15% in U.S. dollars ($565.5 million in 2001 versus $669.0 million in 2000) and decreased approximately 12% in local currency compared to 2000. The comparatively strong U.S. dollar in 2001 had the currency effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $22.8 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2000. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained relatively constant at approximately 33% for both 2001 and 2000. Cost reduction activities in 2001 contributed to offsetting the adverse effect of lower sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14% for both 2001 and 2000. Interest expense was $56.1 million for 2001 compared to $61.7 million for 2000. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. Other expenses, net for 2001 and 2000 was $5.6 million and $9.5 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 38% for both 2001 and 2000. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Net sales were $1,359.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $1,010.6 million for 1999. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 31% compared to 1999 ($1,009.2 million in 2000 versus $770.0 million in 1999). Such increase is primarily attributable to increased sales of products and interconnect systems for internet equipment and 16 upgrades, wireless network infrastructures and mobile handsets. In addition, sales of interconnect products for industrial and aerospace applications experienced growth in 2000. Sales of cable products increased 46% compared to 1999 ($350.5 million in 2000 versus $240.6 million in 1999). Sales of coaxial cable for cable television increased as cable operators continued to upgrade and expand their systems to offer enhanced services. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2000 increased approximately 33% compared to 1999 ($690.7 million in 2000 versus $519.5 million in 1999); international sales for 2000, including export sales, increased approximately 36% in U.S.dollars ($669.0 million in 2000 versus $491.1 million in 1999) and increased approximately 44% in local currency compared to 1999. The comparatively strong U.S. dollar in 2000 had the currency effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $36.1 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 1999. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) increased approximately 1% for 2000 compared to 1999. The increase in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to changes in product mix and the absorption of fixed costs over higher sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14% in 2000 compared to 1999. Interest expense was $61.7 million for 2000 compared to $79.3 million 1999. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels. Other expenses, net for 2000 and 1999 was $9.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2000 was at an effective rate of 38% compared to an effective rate of 42% in 1999. The decrease is generally attributable to non deductible expenses (goodwill amortization) being a lower percentage of pretax income. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities totaled $118.9 million, $154.2 million, and $64.1 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in cash from operating activities in 2001 compared to 2000 is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization charges and to a net increase in non cash components of working capital. In 2000, the increase in cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to an increase in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization charges. Cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures ($38.6 million, $53.1 million and $23.5 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively), and acquisitions ($60.5 million, $67.7 million, and $12.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively). The Company has a bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement) which includes a Term Loan, encompassing a Tranche A and B, and a $150 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2001, the Tranche A had a balance of $242.7 million and matures over the period 2002 to 2004,and the Tranche B had a balance of $284.5 million and matures over the period 2005 and 2006. The revolving credit facility expires in 2004; and, availability under the facility at December 31, 2001 was $127.6 million, after reduction of $7.3 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. The Bank Agreement also requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including interest coverage and leverage ratio tests, and includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness and restricted payments, including dividends on the Companys common stock. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the Companys interest cost on $450 million of borrowings under the Bank Agreement. These agreements expire in 2002. A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The agreement expires in May 2004 with respect to $60.0 million of accounts receivable and expires in July 2002 with respect to an additional $25.0 million of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2001 approximately $74.2 million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Companys EBITDA, as defined in the Bank Agreement, was $253.1 million and $298.9 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. EBITDA is not a defined term under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and is not an alternative to operating income or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. The Company believes that EBITDA provides additional information for determining its ability to meet future debt service requirements; however, EBITDA does not reflect cash available to fund cash requirements. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service requirements. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its 9 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007("Notes"). The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash 17 flow, the Companys revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys current sale of accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. The Company has not paid, and does not have any present intention to commence payment of, cash dividends on its common stock. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2002 will be approximately $40 million. The Companys required debt amortization in 2002 is $60 million; the Companys required cash interest payments for 2002, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $50 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. In December 1999, the Company sold 2.75 million shares of common stock in a public offering resulting in net proceeds of $181.8 million. $105.5 million of such proceeds was used to redeem $96 million principal amount of Notes at a price of 109.875% and the balance of the proceeds was used to pay down term debt under the Bank Agreement. The redemption of Notes resulted in an extraordinary loss for the early extinguishment of debt(consisting of a prepayment premium and the write off of related deferred debt issuance costs) of $13.6 million, less tax benefits of $4.9 million. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 ("Honeywell")), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is currently obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30 million and 100% of the costs in excess of $30 million. At December 31, 2001, approximately $26 million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. INFLATION AND COSTS The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. RISK MANAGEMENT The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. RECENT ACCOUNTING CHANGES In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, ("FASB") issued FAS No. 141 "Business Combinations" and No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Among other provisions, all future business combinations will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the use of the pooling of interest method is prohibited. In addition, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company adopted FAS No. 141 effective July 1, 2001 and will adopt FAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002, although certain provisions were applied to an acquisition that closed subsequent to June 30, 2001. Such application had the effect of reducing amortization of goodwill expense in 2001 by approximately $.4 million. While the Company is in the process of evaluating the effect of this new standard, it anticipates that discontinuing of the amortization of goodwill beginning in 2002 will have the effect of reducing expenses by approximately $14.5 million; and, the Company does not anticipate that it will recognize an impairment loss of goodwill on adoption of such standard. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This pronouncement addresses the recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. In October 2001, the 18 FASB issued FAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets, including discontinued operations. The Company will adopt FAS No. 143 and FAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect these new standards will have on the Companys financial statements. EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION On January 1, 1999, certain member countries of the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the European Unions common currency (the "euro"). The transition period for the introduction of the euro began on January 1,1999. Beginning January 1, 2002, the participating countries issued new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions. No later than July 1, 2002, the participating countries will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in the legacy currencies, so that the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any transactions, making the conversion to the euro complete. Based on progress to date, the Company believes that the use of the euro will not have a significant impact on the manner in which it conducts its business. Accordingly, conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverablility of the carrying value of such assets is periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK The Company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital; although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. INTEREST RATE RISK The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities. The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2001, the Company had interest rate volatility protection in the form of such swaps that effectively fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $450 million of floating rate bank debt at 5.76%. At December 31, 2001, the three month LIBOR rate was 1.9%. These swap agreements expire in 2002. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2001 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.5 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2002, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 19
