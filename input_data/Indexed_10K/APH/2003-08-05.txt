Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 65.9 63.8 65.2 Depreciation and amortization expense 3.3 2.9 2.1 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.4 14.1 13.7 Amortization of goodwill 1.3 1.0 Operating income 16.4 17.9 18.0 Interest expense (4.3 ) (5.1 ) (4.6 ) Other expenses, net (.5 ) (.5 ) (.7 ) Income before income taxes 11.6 12.3 12.7 Provision for income taxes (4.0 ) (4.7 ) (4.8 ) Net income 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.9 % 15  2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales were $1,062.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1,103.8 million for 2001. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 2% compared to 2001 ($892.3 million in 2002 versus $906.8 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales (approx. $52.8 million) of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. These declines occurred primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe and resulted from a generally slowing economy and a continuing slowdown in communication related markets. Major OEM customers that manufacture equipment for telecom infrastructure (including wireless) and internet related applications experienced a slowdown in purchases from system operators due to a variety of factors including the availability of capital and a shortfall from expectations of demand. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales (approx. $38.3 million) of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace, automotive and wireless handset markets. The increase in sales of military aerospace products (approximately $12 million), relates primarily to the acquisition of a backplane assembly business in North America. The increase in automotive sales (approximately $11 million), occurred primarily in North America and relates to the increasing use of electronic componentry in automobiles. The increase in sales in the wireless handset market (approximately $15 million), reflects the strong market for these products in Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 14% compared to 2001 ($169.7 million in 2002 versus $197.0 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators. The lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2002 decreased approximately 7% compared to 2001 ($501.1 million in 2002 versus $538.9 million in 2001); international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($560.9 million in 2002 versus $564.8 million in 2001) and decreased approximately 3% in local currency compared to 2001. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $14.4 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2001. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) was 31% for 2002 compared to 33% for 2001. The decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a difficult pricing environment, particularly in the communications markets, and the adverse effect on production costs of the lower sales volume, partially offset by cost reduction programs relating to purchased materials and services and a shift of headcount from high cost to low cost labor areas. The pricing environment in communication related markets is expected to remain difficult in the near term. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $152.9 million and $155.8 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $1.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the Broadband market, declined approximately $2.6 million, commensurate with sales declines for those products. Administration expenses were down by approximately $1.5 million due to a reduction in compensation cost. Goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002, as a result of adopting FAS No.142; whereas goodwill amortization was $14.3 million in 2001. Interest expense was $45.9 million for 2002 compared to $56.1 million for 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2003 is expected to be approximately $35 million. Other expenses, net for 2002 and 2001 was $5.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses ($2.7 million loss 16 in 2002 and $1.4 million gain in 2001), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2002 and strength in 2001, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.8 million in 2002 and $3.9 million in 2001), reflecting lower receivable sales and fee rates in 2002, minority interests ($1.8 million in 2002 and 2001) and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($.6 million in 2002 and $.5 million in 2001). In addition, in 2002 the Company realized $1.5 million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an effective rate of 35% compared to 38% in 2001. For 2001, the effective tax rate, excluding non deductible goodwill amortization,was 35%. 2001 Compared to 2000 Net sales were $1,103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1,359.7 million for 2000. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 10% compared to 2000 ($906.8 million in 2001 versus $1,009.2 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. These declines occurred primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe and resulted from a generally slowing economy and a significant slowdown in communication related markets. Major OEM customers that manufacture equipment for telecom infrastructure (including wireless) and internet related applications experienced a slowdown in purchases from system operators due to a variety of factors including the availability of capital and a shortfall from expectations of demand. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace and automotive markets. The increase in sales in military aerospace products (approximately $40 million) occurred primarily in North America and Europe and relates to increases in defense expenditures and products for avionics packaging applications. Approximately $29 million of the increase related to two acquisitions completed in 2001. The increase in automotive sales of approximately $10 million related to the acquisition of a European cable assembly business. Sales of cable products decreased 44% compared to 2000 ($197.0 million in 2001 versus $350.5 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by certain U.S. and international cable television operators. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2001 decreased approximately 25% compared to 2000 ($538.9 million in 2001 versus $714.8 million in 2000); international sales for 2001 decreased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($564.8 million in 2001 versus $644.9 million in 2000) and decreased approximately 9% in local currency compared to 2000. The comparatively strong U.S. dollar in 2001 had the currency effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $22.8 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2000. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained relatively constant at approximately 33% for both 2001 and 2000. Cost reduction activities in 2001 contributed to offsetting the adverse effect of lower sales volume, the most significant of which was a worldwide headcount reduction, throughout the year, of approximately 2,000 people to adjust to lower sales volume levels. In addition, the Company instituted programs to lower the cost of purchased materials and services. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $155.8 million and $186.1 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures declined approximately $1.0 million, reflecting reduction in expenditures on new product development and push out of customer programs. Selling and marketing expenses declined approximately $17.0 million commensurate with the decline in sales reflecting reduced commission and other variable sales related expenses. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, declined $8.6 million, commensurate with the decline in cable sales. 17 Administrative expenses declined approximately $3.7 million due to a reduction in compensation expense. Interest expense was $56.1 million for 2001 compared to $61.7 million for 2000. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. Other expenses, net for 2001 and 2000 was $5.6 million and $9.5 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses ($1.4 million gain in 2001 and $3.3 million gain in 2000), reflecting the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($3.9 million in 2001 and $5.5 million in 2000), reflecting lower receivable sales and fee rates in 2001, minority interests ($1.8 million in 2001 and $5.4 million 2000), reflecting the purchase of additional interests in certain companies, and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($.5 million in 2001 and $.7 million in 2000). See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 38% for both 2001 and 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $131.6 million, $118.9 million, and $154.2 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in non cash components of working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income. In 2001 the decrease in cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization charges and to a net increase in non cash components of working capital. The non cash components of working capital decreased $15.8 million in 2002 due primarily to a $12.9 million decrease in inventory as inventory levels were reduced in response to lower sales levels. Inventory turnover remained constant at approximately 3.5x. The non cash components of working capital increased $10.0 million in 2001. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities declined $74.9, $44.2 and $34.5 million, respectively, for a net $3.8 million increase in the non cash components of working capital. These reductions were driven primarily by lower sales volume, and in the case of accrued liabilities, increased income tax payments. Inventory increased approximately $2.8 million, inventory turnover which had improved to 4.6x in 2000 as sales levels significantly increased, returned to historical levels of approximately 3.5x in 2001. In addition, accrued interest declined $2.1 million. The non cash components of working capital increased $5.1 million in 2000. Accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $70.9, $4.4, $41.4 and $26.3 million, respectively, for a net $7.6 million increase in the non cash component of working capital. These increases were driven primarily by higher sales volume. In addition, accounts receivable increased approximately $19.8 million due to an increase of 5 days in days sales outstanding, computed before receivables sales, to 64 days at December 31, 2000. Inventory turnover improved to 4.6x in 2000 from historical levels of approximately 3.5x in 1999, as a relatively small amount of inventory was added to accommodate the significant sales increases. Accounts receivable increased $18.0 million, primarily due to an $11 million reduction in sales of receivables (further discussed below), and an $8.4 million increase due to translation resulting from the relatively weakened U.S. dollar at December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001. Days sales outstanding, computed before sales of receivables, increased one day to 66 days, offset by an increase of approximately $3.6 million in the bad debt reserve. Inventory decreased $2.7 million to $205.6 million, a reduction of $12.9 million in response to lower sales levels, was primarily offset by an increase of $8.7 million due to translation resulting from the relatively weakened U.S.dollar at December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001, and inventory from acquired companies. 18 Inventory turnover remained constant at 3.5x. Prepaid expenses and other assets and deferred taxes and other assets, increased $11.0 million to $31.6 million and $12.4 million to $37.8 million, respectively, reflecting the increase in deferred taxes, the details of which are included in Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill increased $26.4 million to $486.8 million as a result of acquisitions completed in 2002. Land and depreciable assets, net, declined $4.2 million to $160.7 million reflecting capital expenditures of $18.8 million, assets from acquisitions of approximately $6.5 million, an increase of $4.9 million due to translation resulting from the relatively weakened U.S. dollar at December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001, and depreciation of $34.4 million. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased $66.7 million due to an increase in the additional minimum pension liability for the Companys defined benefit plan as discussed in "Pensions" below. Deferred taxes and other liabilities declined $15.4 million to $7.7 million, reflecting the reduction in the liability recorded at December 31, 2001 for the revaluation of interest rate derivatives. As noted in "Interest Rate Risk" below, such agreements expired in 2002. Cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures ($18.8 million, $38.6 million and $53.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively), and acquisitions ($33.8 million, $60.5 million, and $67.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively). The Company has a bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement) which includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B,and a $150 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2002, the Tranche A had a balance of $179.5 million and matures over the period 2003 to 2004, and the Tranche B had a balance of $284.5 million and matures over the period 2005 and 2006. The revolving credit facility expires in 2004; and, availability under the facility at December 31, 2002 was $142.8 million, after reduction of $7.2 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. The Bank Agreement requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio of higher than 2x (EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage test (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 4x. At December 31, 2002 such ratios as defined in the Bank Agreement were 4.63x and 3.02x, respectively. The Bank Agreement also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness in excess of $50 million for capital leases, $200 million for general indebtedness and $200 million for acquisition indebtedness, of which approximately $2 million, $26 million and $0 were outstanding at December 31, 2002, and restricted payments, including dividends on the Companys common stock, in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income, or approximately $187 million at December 31, 2002. The Company is currently pursuing a refinancing of its senior credit facilities. The new credit facilities would be used to replace the Companys existing credit facilities, and may be used to redeem all or a portion of the Companys outstanding senior subordinated notes. The objective of the proposed refinancing is to extend the maturities of debt coming due in 2004 to 2006 so as to give the Company more options in utilizing cash flow generated from operations to grow and expand the business without increasing the Companys interest cost. There can be no assurance that the refinancing will be completed or the refinancing objectives will be achieved. A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The agreement provides certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. The agreement expires in May 2004 with respect to $60.0 million of accounts receivable and expires in July 2003 with respect to an additional $25.0 million of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2002, approximately $63.2 million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. 19 The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its 97/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 ("Notes"). The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Companys revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. The Company has not paid, and does not have any present intention to commence payment of, cash dividends on its common stock.The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2003 will be approximately $28 million. The Companys required debt and capital lease amortization in 2003 is $78.4 million; the Companys required cash interest payments for 2003, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $33 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. Management believes that the Companys working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 ("Honeywell")), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition,Honeywell is currently obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30 million and 100% of the costs in excess of $30 million. At December 31, 2002, approximately $29.1 million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental cleanup matters identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating, aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw 20 material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Recent Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" and FAS No.144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". FAS No. 143 addresses the recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. FAS No.144 addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets, including discontinued operations. There was no effect to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146), "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. The statement is effective beginning January 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others". The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December 15, 2002 and had no material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure". FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options,and the disclosures required by FAS 123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities". It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan ("Plan") covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. 21 Our pension cost (credit) for all pension plans approximated $.7 million, $(.3) million and $(.3) million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing our expected long term rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical 13 year compounded return of 10.8%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 11%, 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. Because of market fluctuation, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2002 was 50% with equity managers and 50% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe, however, that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company reduced the expected long term rate of return assumption by 100 basis points to 9.5% beginning in 2003. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately $2 million. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 7.25% at December 31, 2001 to 6.5% at December 31, 2002. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately $2 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $9.5 million or increased $10.4 million, respectively. The financial markets have declined significantly in recent years, which has had an adverse effect on Plan assets. In 2002, this resulted in a $42.5 million non cash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders equity. Such charge represents an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of $67.0 million, net of deferred taxes. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the pension plans in 2003 of approximately $7.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand. 22 Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2002, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations Total Lesss than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years More than 5 years (dollars in thousands) Long Term Debt $ 642,275 $ 77,026 $ 234,574 $ 330,675 Capital Lease Obligations 1,973 1,337 636 Operating Leases 37,820 12,968 13,376 4,923 6,553 Purchase Obligations 39,958 37,633 2,015 223 87 Other Long Term Liabilities 3,250 1,125 1,125 1,000 Total $ 725,276 $ 130,089 $ 251,726 $ 336,821 $ 6,640 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities. The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company had two fixed rate interest swap agreements totaling $450 million that expired in 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 1.9%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2002 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2003, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 23
