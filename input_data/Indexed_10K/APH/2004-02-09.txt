Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2003 approximately 55% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, natural resource exploration and automotive applications and; commercial and military aerospace applications. The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 3% of net sales in 2003. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as 14 it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost labor areas. The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: Focus on customer needs Design and develop application specific interconnect solutions Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure Maintain a culture of controlling cost Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $1,240 million, $204 million and $104 million, respectively; up 17%, 18% and 29%, respectively, from 2002. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased in each of the Companys major markets and geographic regions; sales of cable products were stable with the prior year. Net income benefited from both the increase in operating income and reduced interest expense. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in "Results of Operations" below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to reduce indebtedness. In 2003, the Company reduced debt by approximately $107 million. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 66.2 65.9 63.8 Depreciation and amortization expense 3.0 3.3 2.9 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.3 14.4 14.1 Amortization of goodwill 1.3 Operating income 16.5 16.4 17.9 Interest expense (2.4 ) (4.3 ) (5.1 ) Other expenses, net (.6 ) (.5 ) (.5 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt (.8 ) Income before income taxes 12.7 11.6 12.3 Provision for income taxes (4.3 ) (4.0 ) (4.7 ) Net income 8.4 % 7.6 % 7.6 % 15  2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales were $1,239.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $1,062.0 million for 2002. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 20% compared to 2002 ($1,072.0 million in 2003 versus $892.3 million in 2002). Sales increased in the Companys major end markets including military/aerospace, mobile communications, industrial, automotive and computer/data communications markets. The increases occurred in all major geographic regions, with approximately one third of the increase attributable to the effect of currency translation, as detailed below. The remaining increase was attributable to the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Companys major end markets and acquisitions in 2002 and 2003. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $47 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe, and an acquisition ($8 million). The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $42 million) is attributable to the acquisition of companies in North America and China serving the network infrastructure market (approximately $18 million) and increases in Asia in sales of handset products. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $36 million) reflects increases resulting from acquisitions in North America (approximately $16 million) and increased sales in Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $33 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America reflecting increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $23 million; a cable assembly acquisition in North America contributed one third of the increase, the remainder reflects increased sales in Europe and Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 1% compared to 2002 ($167.5 million in 2003 versus $169.7 million in 2002). Such decrease is generally attributable to continuing low levels of capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators for cable system upgrades and expansion. The lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2003 increased approximately 11% compared to 2002 ($555.9 million in 2003 versus $501.1 million in 2002); international sales for 2003 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($683.6 million in 2003 versus $560.9 million in 2002) and increased approximately 12% in local currency compared to 2002. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2003 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $63.9 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2002. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained constant at 31% for 2003 and 2002. An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment was offset by a decline in margins in the cable products segment. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year, the increase is generally attributable to the effects of higher sales volume and cost reduction activities relating to purchased materials and increased activity in low cost labor areas. The increase was offset by a decline in operating profit margins for cable products of approximately 6% compared to the prior year due primarily to higher material costs and change in product mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $177.4 million and $152.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $2.2 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, remained stable, commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.9 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions and medical benefits. Interest expense was $29.5 million for 2003 compared to $45.9 million for 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the 16 second quarter of 2003 (see liquidity and capital resources) and lower average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2004 is expected to be approximately $23 million. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Companys senior credit facilities. Such one time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Companys Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8 million. Other expenses, net for 2003 and 2002 was $7.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($1.3 million in 2003 and $2.7 million in 2002), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2003 and 2002, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.5 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($2.4 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002) and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($.8 million in 2003 and $.6 million in 2002). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds), and in 2002 the Company realized $1.5 million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2003 was at an effective rate of 34% compared to 34.5% in 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales were $1,062.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1,103.8 million for 2001. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 2% compared to 2001 ($892.3 million in 2002 versus $906.8 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales (approx. $52.8 million) of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. These declines occurred primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe and resulted from a generally slowing economy and a continuing slowdown in communication related markets. Major OEM customers that manufacture equipment for telecom infrastructure (including wireless) and internet related applications experienced a slowdown in purchases from system operators due to a variety of factors including the availability of capital and a shortfall from expectations of demand. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales (approx. $38.3 million) of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace, automotive and wireless handset markets. The increase in sales of military aerospace products (approximately $12 million), relates primarily to the acquisition of a backplane assembly business in North America. The increase in automotive sales (approximately $11 million) occurred primarily in North America and relates to the increasing use of electronic componentry in automobiles. The increase in sales in the wireless handset market (approximately $15 million), reflects the strong market for these products in Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 14% compared to 2001 ($169.7 million in 2002 versus $197.0 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2002 decreased approximately 7% compared to 2001 ($501.1 million in 2002 versus $538.9 million in 2001); international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($560.9 million in 2002 versus $564.8 million in 2001) and decreased approximately 3% in local currency compared to 2001. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $14.4 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2001. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) was 31% for 2002 compared to 33% for 2001. The decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a difficult pricing environment, particularly in the communications markets, and the adverse effect 17 on production costs of the lower sales volume, partially offset by cost reduction programs relating to purchased materials and services and a shift of headcount from high cost to low cost labor areas. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $152.9 million and $155.8 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $1.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the Broadband market, declined approximately $2.6 million, commensurate with sales declines for those products. Administrative expenses were down by approximately $1.5 million due to a reduction in compensation cost. Goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002, as a result of adopting FAS No.142; whereas goodwill amortization was $14.3 million in 2001. Interest expense was $45.9 million for 2002 compared to $56.1 million for 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. Other expenses, net for 2002 and 2001 was $5.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses ($2.7 million loss in 2002 and $1.4 million gain in 2001), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2002 and strength in 2001, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.8 million in 2002 and $3.9 million in 2001), reflecting lower receivable sales and fee rates in 2002, minority interests ($1.8 million in 2002 and 2001) and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($.6 million in 2002 and $.5 million in 2001). In addition, in 2002 the Company realized $1.5 million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an effective rate of 34.5% compared to 38.2% in 2001. For 2001, the effective tax rate, excluding non deductible goodwill amortization, was 35%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $159.4 million, $131.6 million and $118.9 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income partially offset by a smaller reduction in the 2003 period in non cash components of working capital. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in non cash components of working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income. The non cash components of working capital decreased $1.0 million in 2003 due primarily to a $20.8 million increase in accounts payable, an operating reduction of $4.6 million in inventory, and an increase of $10.2 million in accrued liabilities partially offset by a $28.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels. The non cash components of working capital decreased $15.8 million in 2002 due primarily to a $12.9 million decrease in inventory as inventory levels were reduced in response to lower sales levels. The non cash components of working capital increased $10.0 million in 2001. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities declined $74.9 million, $44.2 million and $34.5 million, respectively, for a net $3.8 million increase in the non cash components of working capital. These reductions were driven primarily by lower sales volume, and in the case of accrued liabilities, increased income tax payments. Inventory increased approximately $2.8 million; inventory turnover which had improved to 4.6x in 2000 as sales levels significantly increased, returned to historical levels of approximately 3.5x in 2001. In addition, accrued interest declined $2.1 million. 18 In 2003, accounts receivable increased $41.2 million to $172.5 million, due to an increase in sales levels, $9.5 million from acquired companies, and a $13.5 million increase due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002, partially offset by a $10.6 million increase in sales of receivables (further discussed below). Days sales outstanding, computed before sales of receivables, remained constant at 66 days. Inventory increased $15.7 million to $221.4 million, primarily due to an increase of $12.9 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002, and $7.4 million in inventory from acquired companies which more than offset the operating reduction of $4.6 million. Inventory turnover increased to 3.9x at December 31, 2003 from 3.5x at December 31, 2002. Deferred taxes and other assets decreased $9.4 million to $28.4 million reflecting the decrease in deferred taxes, the details of which are included in Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill increased $29.5 million to $516.3 million as a result of acquisitions completed in 2003. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $17.6 million to $178.3 million reflecting capital expenditures of $30.2 million, assets from acquisitions of approximately $11.6 million, an increase of $12.3 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002, and depreciation of $36.5 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $28.3 million and $6.5 million to $116.8 million and $31.1 million, respectively, due primarily to an increase in sales levels, liabilities from acquired companies and a $5.7 million and $1.7 million increase, respectively, due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. Other accrued liabilities increased $16.6 million to $56.1 million relating primarily to an increase in accrued income taxes, liabilities for the purchase of acquired companies and accruals relating to higher sales volume. Cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures ($30.2 million, $18.8 million and $38.6 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively), and acquisitions ($51.1 million, $33.8 million and $60.5 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively). In 2003, cash from operating activities of $159.4 million, proceeds from the refinancing of $27.0 million, additional sales of receivables of $10.6 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $35.9 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $30.2 million, acquisitions of $51.1 million, an increase in cash on hand of $2.9 million and for a net debt reduction of $148.8 million. For 2002, cash from operating activities of $131.6 million, cash on hand of $7.3 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $5.8 million were used to fund capital expenditures of $18.8 million, acquisitions of $13.0 million, a reduction in sales of receivables of $11.0 million and a net reduction in bank debt of $81.0 million. During the second quarter 2003, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities. Borrowings of $625.0 million under a new bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement), described below, were used to repay $439.5 million outstanding under the Companys previous bank agreement, redeem all outstanding senior subordinated notes totaling $148.7 million (including the call premium of $4.7 million) and to pay other fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of $8.9 million. A prepayment of the new bank loan of $37.0 million was made in June with excess borrowing proceeds and cash flow from operations and additional prepayments of $89.0 million were made in the second half of 2003. The refinancing had the effect of extending the maturity of the Companys debt coming due in 2003 through 2007. The Companys new Bank Agreement includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $125.0 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2003, the Tranche A had a balance of $90.0 million and matures over the period 2006 to 2008, and the Tranche B had a balance of $409.0 million and matures in 2010. The revolving credit facility expires in 2008; availability under the facility at December 31, 2003 was $117.2 million, after a reduction of $7.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Companys interest rate on loans under the new Bank Agreement is LIBOR plus 19 200 basis points. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. In addition, if the Companys credit rating as assigned by Standard & Poors or Moodys were to decline to BB or Ba3, respectively, the Company would be required to perfect liens in favor of participants in the Bank Agreement in substantially all of the Companys U.S. based assets. At December 31, 2003, the Companys credit rating from Standard and Poors was BB+ and from Moodys was Ba2. The Bank Agreement requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio of higher than 3x (EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage test (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.8x. At December 31, 2003, such ratios as defined in the Bank Agreement, were 7.82x and 2.49x, respectively. The Bank Agreement also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness in excess of $50 million for capital leases, $200 million for general indebtedness and $200 million for acquisition indebtedness, of which approximately $2.1 million, $0 and $0 were outstanding at December 31, 2003, and restricted payments, including dividends on the Companys Common Stock, in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income, or approximately $39.0 million at December 31, 2003. In conjunction with entering into the new Bank Agreement the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $150.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 2.44% and 1.24%, expiring in 2006 and 2004, respectively. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Companys revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2004 will be approximately $40 million. The Companys required debt and capital lease amortization in 2004 is $10.7 million; the Companys required cash interest payments for 2004, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $22 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company has not paid, and does not have any present intention to commence payment of, cash dividends on its common stock; however, this policy will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Management believes that the Companys working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. The agreement expires in May 2004. It is the Companys intention to renew or replace the agreement at expiration on similar terms. At December 31, 2003, approximately $73.8 million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. 20 Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 "Honeywell"), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating, aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Stock Split On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2 for 1 stock split that will be effective for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The Company expects the additional shares to be distributed on or before March 29, 2004. The share information included herein does not reflect the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.146 (FAS 146), "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. There was no effect to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others". The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a 21 guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December 15, 2002 and have no material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure". FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options, and the disclosures required by FAS 123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In January and December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities". It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it. The Company adopted this interpretation in 2003 and there was no effect to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption. In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 (FAS 149), "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 (FAS 150), "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. The statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132R (FAS 132R), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." FAS 132R amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 132 to require additional disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flow and net periodic benefit cost. The statement is effective in 2003 and the related disclosures have been included in Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan ("Plan") covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense (credit) for all pension plans approximated $6.5 million, $.7 million and $(.3) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for U.S. plans, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical fourteen year compounded return of 11.4%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 11%, 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. As of December 31, 2003, our asset allocation was 63% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption is 9.5% for both 2003 and 2004. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 6.5% at December 31, 2002 to 6.15% at December 31, 2003. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2004 by approximately $.8 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $11.6 million or increased $12.8 million, respectively. The financial markets declined significantly in 2002, which had an adverse effect on Plan assets. This resulted in a $42.5 million non cash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders equity. Such charge represented an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of $67.0 million, net of deferred taxes. The Company made a cash contribution to the U.S. pension plans in 2003 of $10.0 million. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations declined modestly in 2003 to $100.3 million from $102.4 million in 2002, as the positive impact on assets of improved investment returns was offset by the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non U.S. plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the pension plan in 2004 of approximately $10 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 23 Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2003, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years More than 5 years (dollars in thousands) Long Term Debt $ 541,076 $ 9,588 $ 37,088 $ 85,092 $ 409,308 Capital Lease Obligations 1,883 1,091 792 Operating Leases 40,404 13,424 15,663 6,417 4,900 Purchase Obligations 58,199 57,220 870 109 Other Long Term Liabilities 8,179 6,691 1,205 205 78 Total $ 649,741 $ 88,014 $ 55,618 $ 91,823 $ 414,286 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. 24 Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the second quarter 2003 as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above. In conjunction with the refinancing, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $150.0 million of floating rate debt at 2.44% and 1.24%, expiring in 2006 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2003, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 1.8%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2003 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.1 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2004, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 25
