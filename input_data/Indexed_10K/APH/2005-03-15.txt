Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2004 approximately 56% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, natural resource exploration and automotive applications; and commercial and military aerospace applications. The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which was less than 4% of net sales in 2004. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost labor areas. The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: Focus on customer needs Design and develop application specific interconnect solutions Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure Maintain a culture of controlling cost Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $1,530.4 million, $276.6 million and $163.3 million, respectively; up 23%, 35% and 57%, respectively, from 2003. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in each of the Companys related major markets and geographic regions. Net income benefited from both the increase in operating income and reduced interest expense. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations below. In addition, one strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock and to reduce indebtedness. In 2004, the Company generated operating cash flow of $208.3 million of which $100.3 million was used to reduce debt. 14 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 65.3 66.2 65.9 Depreciation and amortization expense 2.5 3.0 3.3 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.1 14.3 14.4 Operating income 18.1 16.5 16.4 Interest expense (1.5 ) (2.4 ) (4.3 ) Other expenses, net (.4 ) (.6 ) (.5 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt (.8 ) Income before income taxes 16.2 12.7 11.6 Provision for income taxes (5.5 ) (4.3 ) (4.0 ) Net income 10.7 % 8.4 % 7.6 % 15 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales were $1,530.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,239.5 million for 2003 an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies compared to 2003 ($1,333.8 million in 2004 versus $1,072.0 million in 2003). Sales increased in all major geographic regions as a result of the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Companys major end markets and the impact of acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 ($50.3 million). Sales increased in the Companys major end markets including mobile communications, industrial, automotive, military/aerospace, and computer/data communications markets. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $105.7 million) is attributable primarily to increased demand on wireless infrastructure products in all regions, increased demand on mobile handset products in Asia and the impact of acquisitions during 2003 of companies in North America and China serving the wireless installation market. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $49 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $34 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America, reflecting the increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars and as a result of acquisitions. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $63.9 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $11.1 million reflecting increased sales in North America, Europe and Asia and the impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products increased 17% compared to 2003 ($196.6 million in 2004 versus $167.5 million in 2003). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2004 increased approximately 21% compared to 2003 ($674.3 million in 2004 versus $555.9 million in 2003); international sales for 2004 increased approximately 25% in U.S. dollars ($856.1 million in 2004 versus $683.6 million in 2003) and increased approximately 19% in local currency compared to 2003. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2004 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $46.6 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2003. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 32% in 2004 compared to 31% in 2003. An increase in margins was achieved in both the interconnect products and assemblies segment and the cable segment although the cable segment increase was partially offset by a continued increase in material costs. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost controls. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $215.0 million and $177.4 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and remained approximately 14.0% of sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $6.1 million, commensurate with sales, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2004 and 2003. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $11.8 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions, medical benefits and professional fees. Interest expense was $22.5 million for 2004 compared to $29.5 million for 2003. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2003 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and lower average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2005 is expected to be approximately $19 million. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Companys senior credit facilities. Such one time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Companys Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8 million. Other expenses, net, for 2004 and 2003 were $6.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($0.6 million in 2004 and $1.3 million in 2003), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($2.3 million in 2004 and $1.5 million in 2003), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($3.0 million in 2004 and $2.4 million in 2003) and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($1.0 million in 2004 and $0.8 million in 2003). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds). See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 34.0% in 2004 and 2003. 16 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales were $1,239.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $1,062.0 million for 2002. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 20% compared to 2002 ($1,072.0 million in 2003 versus $892.3 million in 2002). Sales increased in the Companys major end markets including military/aerospace, mobile communications, industrial, automotive and computer/data communications markets. The increases occurred in all major geographic regions, with approximately one third of the increase attributable to the effect of currency translation, as detailed below. The remaining increase was attributable to the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Companys major end markets and acquisitions in 2002 and 2003. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $47 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe, and an acquisition ($8 million). The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $42 million) is attributable to the acquisition of companies in North America and China serving the network infrastructure market (approximately $18 million) and increases in Asia in sales of handset products. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $36 million) reflects increases resulting from acquisitions in North America (approximately $16 million) and increased sales in Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $33 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America reflecting increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $23 million; a cable assembly acquisition in North America contributed one third of the increase and the remainder reflects increased sales in Europe and Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 1% compared to 2002 ($167.5 million in 2003 versus $169.7 million in 2002). Such decrease is generally attributable to continuing low levels of capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators for cable system upgrades and expansion. The lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2003 increased approximately 11% compared to 2002 ($555.9 million in 2003 versus $501.1 million in 2002); international sales for 2003 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($683.6 million in 2003 versus $560.9 million in 2002) and increased approximately 12% in local currency compared to 2002. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2003 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $63.9 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2002. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained constant at 31% for 2003 and 2002. An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment was offset by a decline in margins in the cable products segment. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year, the increase is generally attributable to the effects of higher sales volume and cost reduction activities relating to purchased materials and increased activity in low cost labor areas. The increase was offset by a decline in operating profit margins for cable products of approximately 6% compared to the prior year due primarily to higher material costs and change in product mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $177.4 million and $152.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $2.2 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, remained stable, commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.9 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions and medical benefits. Interest expense was $29.5 million for 2003 compared to $45.9 million for 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2003 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and lower average debt levels. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Companys senior credit facilities. Such one time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Companys Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8 million. Other expenses, net, for 2003 and 2002 was $7.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($1.3 million in 2003 and $2.7 million in 2002), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2003 and 2002, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.5 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($2.4 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002) and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($0.8 million in 2003 and $0.6 million in 2002). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds), and in 2002 the Company realized $1.5 million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2003 was at an effective rate of 34% compared to 34.5% in 2002. 17 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $208.3 million, $170.0 million and $120.6 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, the Company reclassified certain amounts in its 2003 and 2002 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow from financing activities to operating activities as a result of a determination that they had not been reported in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 95 Statement of Cash Flows. The amounts reclassified of $10.6 and ($11.0) million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, reflect a change in classification of the net change in the accounts receivables sold under the Companys accounts receivable securitization agreement. As a result of these reclassifications, there was no impact on the Companys net change in cash and short term cash investments in 2003 and 2002. The net change during 2004 in accounts receivables sold under the Companys accounts receivable securitization agreement which is included in operating activities is $6.2 million. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income in addition to a larger reduction in the non cash components of working capital compared to 2003, partially offset by a larger decrease in long term liabilities resulting from a $20 million contribution to the Companys pension plan in 2004 (compared to a $10 million contribution in 2003). The increase in cash from operating activities in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income and a larger reduction in the 2003 period in non cash components of working capital. The non cash components of working capital decreased $14.1 million in 2004 due primarily to a $3.2 million increase in accounts payable, an increase of $15.7 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $6.2 million in receivables sold and an increase of $28.5 million related to accrued income taxes, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and an operating addition of $14.5 million in inventory. The non cash components of working capital decreased $11.6 million in 2003 due primarily to a $20.8 million increase in accounts payable, an operating reduction of $4.6 million in inventory, an increase of $10.6 million in receivables sold, and an increase in accrued income taxes of $18.0 million partially offset by a $28.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and a decrease of $7.7 million in accrued liabilities. The non cash components of working capital decreased $4.8 million in 2002 due primarily to a $12.9 million decrease in inventory as inventory levels were reduced in response to lower sales levels, a $6.2 million increase in accrued income taxes and a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in receivables sold and a $6.5 million reduction in accrued liabilities. In 2004, accounts receivable increased $41.7 million to $214.2 million, due to an increase in sales levels, $12.6 million from an acquired company, and a $9.3 million increase due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in sales of receivables (further discussed below). Days sales outstanding, computed before sales of receivables, decreased to approximately 64 days from 66 days in 2003. Inventory increased $25.9 million to $247.3 million, primarily due to an increase of $6.7 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, and $4.7 million in inventory from an acquired company coupled with an operating addition of $14.5 million. Inventory turnover increased to 4.2x at December 31, 2004 from 3.9x at December 31, 2003. Deferred taxes and other assets decreased $0.3 million to $28.1 million reflecting the decrease in deferred taxes, the details of which are included in Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill increased $29.1 million to $545.4 million primarily as a result of an acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2004 as well as additional contingent consideration paid in 2004 relating to a prior year acquisition. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $19.5 million to $197.8 million reflecting capital expenditures of $44.3 million, assets from acquisitions of approximately $6.8 million, an increase of $7.8 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, depreciation of $38.2 million and disposals of $1.2 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $18.0 million and $7.4 million to $134.9 million and $38.5 million, respectively, due primarily to an increase in sales levels, liabilities assumed from acquired companies and a $0.8 million and $0.3 million increase, respectively, due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. Accrued income taxes increased $23.7 million due primarily to increased profits. Other accrued liabilities increased $5.3 million to $37.1 million relating primarily to an increase in liabilities for the purchase of acquired companies and accruals relating to higher sales volume. In 2004, cash from operating activities of $208.3 million (including additional sales of receivables of $6.2 million) and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $30.3 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $44.3 million, acquisitions of $41.8 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $45.6 million, an increase in cash on hand of $6.6 million and for a net debt reduction of $100.3 million. For 2003, cash from operating activities of $170.0 million (including additional sales of receivables of $10.6 million), proceeds from the refinancing of $27.0 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $35.9 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $30.2 million, acquisitions of $51.1 million, an increase in cash on hand of $2.9 million and for a net debt reduction of $148.8 million. During the second quarter 2003, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities. During 2003 borrowings of $625.0 million under a new bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement), described below, were used to repay $439.5 million outstanding under the Companys previous bank agreement, redeem all outstanding senior subordinated notes totaling $148.7 million (including the call premium of $4.7 million) and to pay other fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of $8.9 million. A prepayment of the new bank loan of $37.0 million was made in June with excess borrowing proceeds and cash flow from operations and additional prepayments of $89.0 million were made in the second half of 2003. The 2003 refinancing had the effect of extending the maturity of the Companys debt coming due in 2003 through 2007. In November 2004, the Company amended the credit agreement. The primary effects of the amendment were to lower interest cost, and reduce limitations relative to additional indebtedness and restricted payments including repurchase of the Companys common stock and dividends. 18 The Companys new Bank Agreement includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $125.0 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2004, the Tranche A had a balance of $13.0 million and matures in 2008, and the Tranche B had a balance of $400.0 million and matures over the period 2005 to 2010 with annual payments of $4 million and a balloon payment due at maturity. The revolving credit facility expires in 2008; availability under the facility at December 31, 2004 was $116.2 million, after a reduction of $8.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Companys interest rate on loans under the new Bank Agreement is LIBOR plus 150 basis points. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. In addition, if the Companys credit rating as assigned by Standard & Poors or Moodys were to decline to BB or Ba3, respectively, the Company would be required to perfect liens in favor of participants in the Bank Agreement in substantially all of the Companys U.S. based assets. At December 31, 2004, the Companys credit rating from Standard and Poors was BB+ and from Moodys was Ba1. The Bank Agreement requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio of higher than 3x (EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage test (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.75x and 3.50x based on total debt and senior debt, respectively. At December 31, 2004, such ratios as defined in the Bank Agreement, were 12.91x, 1.65x and 1.65x, respectively. The Bank Agreement also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness in excess of $50 million for capital leases, $450 million for general indebtedness and $200 million for acquisition indebtedness, of which approximately $6.9 million, $0 and $4.2, respectively, were outstanding at December 31, 2004, and restricted payments, including dividends on the Companys Common Stock, in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income plus $50 million, or approximately $170.6 million at December 31, 2004. In conjunction with entering into the new Bank Agreement the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $50.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 2.44% and 3.01%, expiring in May 2006 and June 2006, respectively. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Companys revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2005 will be approximately $50 million. The Companys required debt and capital lease amortization in 2005 is $16.9 million; the Companys required cash interest payments for 2005, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $19 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. Since its initial public offering in 1991, the Company has not paid any dividends. However, on January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it will commence payment of a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.03 per share. The Company expects the first dividend payment to be made on or about April 6, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2005. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Companys business, repurchase of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Companys working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. The agreement expires in May 2007. At December 31, 2004, approximately $80.0 million ($73.8 million at December 31, 2003) of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) in December 1999, Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to 19 perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Stock Split On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2 for 1 stock split that was effective for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on March 29, 2004. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, No. 123R (FAS 123R) Share based payment. FAS 123R applies to all transactions involving the issuance, by a company, of its own equity (stock, stock options, or other equity instruments) in exchange for goods or services, including employee services. FAS 123R requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock based compensation using the fair value of those stocks on the grant date (with limited exceptions). This statement is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this statement will have on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, but does not anticipate the impact to be more than $2 million per quarter based on the options outstanding as of December 31, 2004. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was enacted. The Act introduced a new prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at a minimum actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. FASB Staff Position (FSP), 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, was provided by the FASB to offer guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements for the Act. The Company does not believe the new Act will have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151 (FAS 151), Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, in an effort to conform U.S. accounting standards for inventories to International Accounting Standards. FAS 151 requires idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) costs to be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the relevant production facilities. FAS 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard but does not believe that it will have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (Plan) covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $10.1 million, $6.5 million and $0.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for U.S. plans, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical fifteen year compounded return of 10.1%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 11%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. As of December 31, 2004, our asset allocation was 65% with equity managers and 35% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption is 9.5% for both 2004 and 2003. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 6.15% at December 31, 2003 to 5.75% at December 31, 2004. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2005 by approximately $1.9 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $13.2 million or increased $14.5 million, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. pension plans of $20 million and $10 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased modestly in 2004 to $102.1 million from $100.3 million in 2003, due to the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non U.S. plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the pension plan in 2005 of approximately $10 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units, in accordance with FAS No. 142, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 21 Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2004, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt $ 442,688 $ 14,341 $ 15,462 $ 31,939 $ 380,946 Capital lease obligations 6,365 2,568 3,763 34 Operating leases 48,708 16,546 17,682 9,127 5,353 Purchase obligations 76,537 74,589 1,402 546 Other long term liabilities 7,275 803 6,394 78 Total $ 581,573 $ 108,847 $ 44,703 $ 41,724 $ 386,299 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the second quarter 2003 as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources above. In conjunction with the 2003 refinancing, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $50.0 million of floating rate debt at 2.44% and 3.01%, expiring in May 2006 and June 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2004, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 2.5%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2004 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2005, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 22
