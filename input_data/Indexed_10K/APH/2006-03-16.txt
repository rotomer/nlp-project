Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2005, approximately 56% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: communication systems and information technology applications; a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation and natural resource exploration, and automotive applications; and commercial aerospace and military applications. The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which was less than 4% of net sales in 2005. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost labor areas. The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: Focus on customer needs Design and develop application specific interconnect solutions Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure Maintain a culture of controlling costs Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $1,808.1 million, $343.3 million and $206.3 million, respectively; up 18%, 24% and 26%, respectively, from 2004. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in each of the Companys related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations below. In addition, one strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2005, the Company generated operating cash flow of $229.6 million. 16 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 64.3 65.3 66.2 Depreciation and amortization expense 2.8 2.5 3.0 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.0 14.1 14.3 Operating income 18.9 18.1 16.5 Interest expense (1.3 ) (1.5 ) (2.4 ) Other expenses, net (.5 ) (.4 ) (.6 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt (.1 ) (.8 ) Income before income taxes 17.0 16.2 12.7 Provision for income taxes (5.6 ) (5.5 ) (4.3 ) Net income 11.4 % 10.7 % 8.4 % 17 2005 Compared to 2004 Net sales were $1,808.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,530.4 million for 2004 an increase of 18% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies. The increase in sales over 2004 excluding acquisitions was 8% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 19% in U.S. dollars and local currencies compared to 2004 ($1,592.4 million in 2005 versus $1,333.8 million in 2004). Sales increased in all major geographic regions as a result of the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Companys major end markets and the impact of acquisitions. Sales increased in the Companys major end markets including mobile communications, military/aerospace, industrial, automotive, and computer/data communications markets. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $92.7 million) is attributable to increased demand for wireless infrastructure products for cell site installations in North America, increased demand on mobile handset products in Asia and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $24.1 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe and the impact of acquisitions. Automotive sales increased approximately $33.7 million primarily in Europe, reflecting the impact of an acquisition in late 2004. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $57.8 million) relates to increased demand on military programs, avionics applications in North America and the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $45.8 million reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased sales in Asia for disk drive and storage applications. Sales of cable products increased 10% compared to 2004 ($215.7 million in 2005 versus $196.6 million in 2004). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2005 increased approximately 19% compared to 2004 ($802.4 million in 2005 versus $674.3 million in 2004); international sales for 2005 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,005.8 million in 2005 versus $856.1 million in 2004) and increased approximately 17% in local currency compared to 2004. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2005 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $7.0 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2004. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 33% in 2005 compared to 32% in 2004. An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment and was partially offset by a decline in margins in the cable segment. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1% compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. The decrease in cable margins was due to the impact of a continued increase in material costs which was not fully offset by price increases implemented during the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $252.2 million and $215.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, approximately 14.0% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $7.6 million, commensurate with sales, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2005 and 2004. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions and medical benefits. Interest expense was $24.1 million for 2005 compared to $22.5 million for 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates partially offset by the effect of the refinancing completed in the third quarter of 2005 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and higher average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2006 is expected to be approximately $40 million. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $2.4 million in 2005, relate to the refinancing of the Companys senior credit facilities. Such one time expenses include the write off of deferred debt issuance costs of $5.7 million partially offset by the settlement of interest rate swap agreements of $3.2 million. Other expenses, net, for 2005 and 2004 were $8.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) ($0.4 million in 2005 and $(0.6) million in 2004), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004, program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($3.8 million in 2005 and $2.3 million in 2004), reflecting higher receivable fee rates in 2005, minority interests ($4.1 million in 2005 and $3.0 million in 2004) and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($1.5 million in 2005 and $1.0 million in 2004) primarily due to higher commitment fees. See Note 10 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 33.0% in 2005 and 34% in 2004. The reduction in the tax rate in 2005 relates primarily to lower U.S. income taxes resulting from the impact of the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 18 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales were $1,530.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,239.5 million for 2003 an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies compared to 2003 ($1,333.8 million in 2004 versus $1,072.0 million in 2003). Sales increased in all major geographic regions as a result of the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Companys major end markets and the impact of acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 ($50.3 million). Sales increased in the Companys major end markets including mobile communications, industrial, automotive, military/aerospace, and computer/data communications markets. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $105.7 million) is attributable primarily to increased demand on wireless infrastructure products in all regions, increased demand on mobile handset products in Asia and the impact of acquisitions during 2003 of companies in North America and China serving the wireless installation market. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $49 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $34 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America, reflecting the increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars and as a result of acquisitions. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $63.9 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $11.1 million reflecting increased sales in North America, Europe and Asia and the impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products increased 17% compared to 2003 ($196.6 million in 2004 versus $167.5 million in 2003). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2004 increased approximately 21% compared to 2003 ($674.3 million in 2004 versus $555.9 million in 2003); international sales for 2004 increased approximately 25% in U.S. dollars ($856.1 million in 2004 versus $683.6 million in 2003) and increased approximately 19% in local currency compared to 2003. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2004 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $46.6 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2003. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 32% in 2004 compared to 31% in 2003. An increase in margins was achieved in both the interconnect products and assemblies segment and the cable segment although the cable segment increase was partially offset by a continued increase in material costs. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost controls. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $215.0 million and $177.4 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and remained approximately 14.0% of sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $6.1 million, commensurate with sales, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2004 and 2003. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $11.8 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions, medical benefits and professional fees. Interest expense was $22.5 million for 2004 compared to $29.5 million for 2003. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2003 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and lower average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2005 is expected to be approximately $19 million. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Companys senior credit facilities. Such one time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Companys Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8 million. Other expenses, net, for 2004 and 2003 were $6.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($0.6 million in 2004 and $1.3 million in 2003), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($2.3 million in 2004 and $1.5 million in 2003), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($3.0 million in 2004 and $2.4 million in 2003) and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($1.0 million in 2004 and $0.8 million in 2003). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds). See Note 10 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 34.0% in 2004 and 2003. 19 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $229.6 million, $208.3 million and $170.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating cash flow includes $5.0 million, $6.2 million and $10.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, resulting from an increase in sale of receivables under the Companys receivable securitization program. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by an increase in the non cash components of working capital compared to a decrease in 2004. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income in addition to a larger reduction in the non cash components of working capital compared to 2003. The non cash components of working capital increased $37.2 million in 2005 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable of $45.2 million and $21.1 million in inventory partially offset by a $25.8 million increase in accounts payable, a decrease of $10.4 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $5.0 million of receivables sold, an increase in accrued interest of $3.0 million, and a decrease of $5.6 million in prepaid expenses and other assets. The non cash components of working capital decreased $14.1 million in 2004 due primarily to a $3.2 million increase in accounts payable, an increase of $15.7 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $6.2 million in receivables sold and an increase of $28.5 million related to accrued income taxes, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and an operating addition of $14.5 million in inventory. The non cash components of working capital decreased $11.6 million in 2003 due primarily to a $20.8 million increase in accounts payable, an operating reduction of $4.6 million in inventory, an increase of $10.6 million in receivables sold, and an increase in accrued income taxes of $18.0 million, partially offset by a $28.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and a decrease of $7.7 million in accrued liabilities. In 2005, accounts receivable increased $88.7 million to $302.9 million, due to an increase in sales levels and $71.7 million from acquired companies, offset by $13.8 million due to translation and by a $5.0 million increase in sales of receivables (further discussed below). Days sales outstanding, computed before sales of receivables, increased to approximately 65 days from 64 days in 2004. Inventory increased $78.6 million to $325.9 million, primarily due to an increase of $60.4 million in inventory from acquired companies coupled with an operating addition of $27.5 million partially offset by $9.3 million of translation resulting from the comparatively strong U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. Inventory turnover remained constant at 4.2x at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Goodwill and acquired intangible assets increased $386.7 million to $934.1 million primarily as a result of acquisitions completed during the year. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $56.1 million to $253.9 million reflecting net capital expenditures of $57.1 million, assets from acquisitions of approximately $57.7 million, partially offset by $9.0 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 and depreciation of $49.7 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $42.4 million and $4.2 million to $177.3 million and $42.7 million, respectively, due to an increase in sales levels and liabilities assumed from acquired companies partially offset by a $4.8 million and $1.9 million decrease, respectively, due to translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. Other accrued liabilities increased $13.7 million to $50.8 million relating primarily to liabilities related to the purchase of acquired companies and accruals relating to higher sales volume. In 2005, cash from operating activities of $229.6 million (including additional sales of receivables of $5.0 million) and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $36.4 million and net borrowings under the Companys bank agreements of $331.1 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $57.1 million, payment of dividends of $8.0 million, acquisitions of $512.3 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $8.7 million, and an increase in cash on hand of $8.5 million. For 2004, cash from operating activities of $208.3 million (including additional sales of receivables of $6.2 million) and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $30.3 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $44.3 million, acquisitions of $41.8 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $45.6 million, an increase in cash on hand of $6.6 million and for a net debt reduction of $100.3 million. On July 15, 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior secured credit facility. The new bank agreement (Revolving Credit Facility) is comprised of a five year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2010, of which approximately $440 million was drawn at closing. The net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Companys previous senior credit facility and for working capital purposes. On November 15, 2005, the Company exercised its option to increase its aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional $250 million thereby increasing the revolving credit facility to $1 billion from $750 million. At December 31, 2005, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $267.6 million, after a reduction of $11.5 million for outstanding letters of credit. In connection with the 2005 refinancing, the Company incurred one time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million (less tax effects of $0.8 million) or $.02 per share after tax. Such one time expenses include the write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The Companys interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 60 basis points. The Company also 20 pays certain annual agency and facility fees. At December 31, 2005, the Companys credit rating from Standard & Poors was BBB and from Moodys was Ba1. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) of higher than 3X and a leverage ratio (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.50X; at December 31, 2005, such ratios as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility were 9.04X and 1.96X, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, (i) indebtedness in excess of $50.0 million for capital leases, $200.0 million for general indebtedness, $200.0 million for acquisition indebtedness, (of which approximately $8.6 million, $0 and $0 were outstanding at December 31, 2005, respectively), (ii) restricted payments including dividends on the Companys Common Stock in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income subsequent to July 15, 2005 plus $250.0 million, or approximately $301.3 million at December 31, 2005, (iii) required consolidated net worth equal to 50% of cumulative consolidated net income commencing April 1, 2005 plus 100% of net cash proceeds from equity issuances commencing April 1, 2005, plus $400.0 million, or approximately $512.4 million at December 31, 2005, (iv) creating or incurring liens, (v) making other investments, and (vi) acquiring or disposing of assets. In conjunction with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $150.0, $250.0 and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively. While it is not the Companys intention to terminate the interest rate swap agreements, the fair value of such agreements was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2005 would have resulted in a pre tax gain of $1.9 million; such gain, net of tax, of $0.8 was recorded in other comprehensive income. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Companys revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2006 will be approximately $75 million. The Companys required debt and capital lease amortization in 2006 is approximately $15.0 million. The Companys required cash interest payments for 2006, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $40 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. On January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it would commence payment of quarterly dividends on its common stock of $.03 per share. The Company paid its fourth quarterly dividend in the amount of $2.7 million or $.03 per share on January 4, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 14, 2005. Cumulative dividends declared during 2005 were $10.8 million of which $8.0 million were paid in 2005. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Companys business, repurchase of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Companys working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. The agreement expires in May 2007. At December 31, 2005, approximately $85.0 million ($80.0 million at December 31, 2004) of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 21 TCS Acquisition On December 1, 2005, pursuant to an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2005 (the Asset Purchase Agreement) by and among the Company and Teradyne Corporation, Inc., a Massachusetts Corporation (Teradyne). The Company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Teradynes backplane and connection systems business segment (TCS), including the stock of certain of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of $384.7 million in cash. In addition, Amphenol incurred approximately $8.8 million of transaction related expenses. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005, includes the results of TCS for the period subsequent to the acquisition date; sales of approximately $34.0 million and minimal net income resulting in no impact to 2005 consolidated net earnings per share. TCS is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire and is a leading supplier of high speed, high density, printed circuit board interconnect products. TCS sells its products primarily to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets. TCS had sales of $373.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of TCS based upon their fair market values. The excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The Company is in the process of completing its analysis of fair value attributes of the assets acquired through the use of independent appraisals and managements estimates. It is anticipated that the final assessment of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessment. In connection with the acquisition the Company recorded $239.3 million of goodwill and $45.5 million of acquired intangible assets of which $30.4 million, $9.0 million and $6.1 million was assigned to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, all of which are subject to amortization. The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted average useful life of approximately 12 years. The license agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships have a weighted average useful life of 8 years, 15 years and 5 years, respectively. The entire amount of goodwill was assigned to the interconnect segment all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information assuming that the TCS acquisition actually occurred as of the beginning of the period presented. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, TCS had sales and operating income of $373.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Such amounts along with $22.2 million of additional pro forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the acquisition are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCS acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Companys financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. For The Year Ended December 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2005 2004 Net sales $ 2,146,286 $ 1,940,834 Operating income 347,301 304,451 Net income 195,675 166,746 Net income per common share Basic $ 2.21 $ 1.89 Net income per common share Diluted 2.16 1.86 To supplement the pro forma combined financial information presented above, the Company uses certain measures which are adjusted from the pro forma GAAP amounts based upon actions taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost structure, the results of which are as shown below. These adjustments are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Companys current and expected financial performance and are forward looking. The adjustments are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Such information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment. The following table sets forth cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring costs and non recurring gains on the sale of a business, which management does not expect to reoccur in the future. This information is included to assist investors and management in assessing the Companys operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Companys ongoing combined operations. 22 For The Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2005 2004 Benefit of reduction in employee related benefits (i) $ 1,969 $ 3,430 Benefit of reduction in Teradyne historical corporate allocations (ii) 7,505 8,000 Reversal of nonrecurring restructuring costs (iii) 11,654 4,148 Reversal of nonrecurring gains on the sale of a business (iv) (612 ) (865 ) Total $ 20,516 $ 14,713 (i) In conjunction with the acquisition, TCSs historical management incentive plan was terminated and replaced by an incentive plan which has higher profitability targets. These targets would not have been achieved at TCSs historic profitability levels and, as such, the related expense would not have been incurred. (ii) Teradyne had historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to TCS which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. Such costs included information technology, human resources, tax, legal, corporate treasury and finance as well as executive administration related items. The acquisition agreement included the hiring of certain Teradyne employees and assumption of certain agreements that related to services historically performed by Teradyne for TCS. In addition, Amphenol assumed the performance of certain tax and treasury functions for TCS. This adjustment represents the excess of the amount charged to TCS by Teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost incurred by TCS and Amphenol since the acquisition. (iii) Teradyne had significant restructuring activities in 2004 and 2005 at TCS resulting in related expenses which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. No significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future, and as such, these costs are considered nonrecurring, and are therefore included above as expected savings. (iv) TCS had recognized gains on the sale of a business in 2004 and 2005 which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. These gains are not expected to occur in the future. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) in December 1999, Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. 23 Stock Split On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2 for 1 stock split that was effective for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on March 29, 2004. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (FAS) 123R Share Based Payment. FAS 123R applies to all transactions involving the issuance, by a company, of its own equity (stock, stock options, or other equity instruments) in exchange for goods or services, including employee services. FAS 123R requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock based compensation using the fair value of those stocks on the grant date (with limited exceptions). In April 2005, the effective date of this statement was deferred and was effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has adopted FAS 123R on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. The impact of adoption of FAS 123R is expected to result in approximately $10.0 million of (pre tax) expense during 2006 although it will depend in part on the level of share based payments granted. Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (Plan) covering U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $13.5 million, $10.1 million and $6.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for U.S. plans, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical sixteen year compounded return of 11.3%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 11%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. As of December 31, 2005, our asset allocation was 66% with equity managers and 34% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption is 9.5% for both 2005 and 2004. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 5.75% at December 31, 2004 to 5.50% at December 31, 2005. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2006 by approximately $.7 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $15.0 million or increased $15.5 million, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. pension plans of $10.0 million and $20.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased modestly in 2005 to $108.8 million from $102.1 million in 2004, due to the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non U.S. plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the pension plan in 2006 of approximately $10.0 to 15.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. 24 Revenue Recognition Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicate that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units, in accordance with FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2005, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt $ 772,399 $ 11,363 $ 2,733 $ 757,256 $ 1,047 Capital lease obligations 8,601 3,667 4,934 Operating leases 58,688 17,712 23,362 10,895 6,719 Purchase obligations 107,564 104,099 3,013 448 4 Other long term liabilities 16,325 977 15,348 Total $ 963,577 $ 137,818 $ 49,390 $ 768,599 $ 7,770 25 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the third quarter 2005 as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources above. In conjunction with the 2005 refinancing and the funds drawn in conjunction with the TCS acquisition (See Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate debt at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2005, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 4.6%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2005 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2006, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 26
