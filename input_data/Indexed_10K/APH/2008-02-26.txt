Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2007, approximately 59% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, natural resource exploration and automotive applications; and commercial aerospace and military applications. The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales in 2007. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: Focus on customer needs Design and develop application specific interconnect solutions Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure Maintain a culture of controlling costs Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $2,851.0 million, $552.9 million and $353.2 million, respectively; up 15%, 30% and 38%, respectively, from 2006. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in all of the Companys related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2007, the Company generated operating cash flow of $387.9 million. 17 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.4 68.1 66.9 Selling, general and administrative expense 13.2 13.9 14.2 Casualty loss related to flood .8 Operating income 19.4 17.2 18.9 Interest expense (1.3 ) (1.6 ) (1.3 ) Other expenses, net (.5 ) (.5 ) (.5 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt (.1 ) Income before income taxes 17.6 15.1 17.0 Provision for income taxes (5.2 ) (4.8 ) (5.6 ) Net income 12.4 % 10.3 % 11.4 % 18 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales were $2,851.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2,471.4 million for 2006, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. The increase in sales over 2006 excluding acquisitions was 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies (approximately 90% of net sales) increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2006 ($2,569.3 million in 2007 versus $2,207.5 million in 2006). Sales increased in all of the Companys major end markets including the military/aerospace, wireless communications, industrial/automotive, and telecommunications and data communications markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $117.5 million primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs including war related spending, as well as an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $104.6 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products for both mobile phones and laptop computers, and to a lesser extent, to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and cell site installation customers. The increase in sales in the industrial/automotive market (approximately $77.0 million) primarily reflects increased new product sales to the European automotive market, increased sales to the natural resource exploration and factory automation markets as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $54.1 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and transmission equipment for data centers. Sales of cable products (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 7% compared to 2006 ($281.8 million in 2007 versus $263.9 million in 2006). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2007 increased approximately 9% compared to 2006 ($1,155.8 million in 2007 versus $1,060.0 million in 2006); international sales for 2007 increased approximately 20% in U.S. dollars ($1,695.2 million in 2007 versus $1,411.5 million in 2006) and increased approximately 16% in local currency compared to 2006. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2007 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $66.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2006. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33% in 2007 compared to 32% in 2006. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. In addition, cable operating margins increased 0.7% due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of specialty products, increased production levels in low cost facilities and price increases partially offset by higher material costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $377.3 million and $342.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, or approximately 13% and 14% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in expense in 2007 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $8.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4% and 5% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, increased by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in stock based compensation expense of $2.7 million, and cost increases relating to professional fees as well as salaries and employee related benefits. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of 2006. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20.7 million, or $.08 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14, 2006. Production activity was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of 2006. As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0 million. Interest expense was $36.9 million for 2007 compared to $38.8 million for 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to the lower average debt levels in 2007. Other expenses, net, for 2007 and 2006 were $15.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($10.5 million in 2007 and $6.0 million in 2006), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($5.2 million in 2007 and $5.0 million in 2006), and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($1.8 million in 2007 and $2.0 million in 2006) offset by interest income ($2.7 million in 2007 and $0.7 million in 2006). 19 The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 29.5% in 2007 and 31.5% in 2006. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Companys income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2007 by approximately $10.0 million or $.05 per share. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales were $2,471.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,808.1 million for 2005, an increase of 37% in U.S. dollars and 36% in local currencies. The increase in sales over 2005 excluding acquisitions was 12% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies (approximately 90% of net sales) increased 39% in U.S. dollars and 38% in local currencies compared to 2005 ($2,207.5 million in 2006 versus $1,592.4 million in 2005). Sales increased in the Companys major end markets including telecommunications and data communications, mobile communications, industrial and military/aerospace markets. Sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets increased approximately $338.8 million reflecting the impact of the acquisition of TCS in December 2005 (Note 8) and increased sales of new high speed interconnect products for servers and other data center equipment applications. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $209.0 million) is attributable primarily to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products, the impact of the acquisition of TCS in December 2005 and to a lesser extent to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from cell site installation customers. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $55.8 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe relating to products for the factory automation, medical and oil/geophysical markets and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $15.4 million) relates to increased demand on commercial aircraft and military programs. Sales in the military/aerospace market were adversely impacted by approximately $25.0 million in 2006 due to business interruption related to the flood at the Companys Sidney, New York facility further described below. Automotive sales declined approximately $8.1 million primarily as a result of a reduction in vehicle production rates by European and U.S. vehicle manufacturers. Sales of cable products (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 22% compared to 2005 ($263.9 million in 2006 versus $215.7 million in 2005). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2006 increased approximately 32% compared to 2005 ($1,060.0 million in 2006 versus $802.4 million in 2005); international sales for 2006 increased approximately 40% in U.S. dollars ($1,411.5 million in 2006 versus $1,005.8 million in 2005) and increased approximately 39% in local currency compared to 2005. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2006 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $16.5 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2005. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 32% in 2006 compared to 33% in 2005 due primarily to a decrease in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment primarily as a result of the TCS acquisition (Note 8). The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 1% compared to the prior year. TCS margins are lower than the average margin of the Company and its inclusion in the consolidated results lowered the margin percentage. Interconnect segment margins excluding the impact of TCS were consistent with the prior year margins as the continuing development of new higher margin, application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control, offset increases resulting primarily from higher material costs. In addition, cable operating margins decreased 0.3% reflecting higher material and freight costs in 2006 driven by higher commodity and energy prices offset, in part, by the impact of price increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $342.8 million and $257.1 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, or approximately 14% of sales in each year. The increase in expense in 2006 is attributable to the impact of acquisitions and increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $13.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2006 and 2005. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $34.2 million, due primarily to increases in costs as a result of the TCS acquisition and stock based compensation expense of $9.7 million, as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which was effective on January 1, 2006, in addition to general cost increases relating to professional fees, pensions and employee related benefits. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of 2006. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20.7 million, or $.08 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14, 2006. Production activity was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of 2006. As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0 million. 20 Interest expense was $38.8 million for 2006 compared to $24.1 million for 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates and higher average debt levels related to the TCS acquisition (Note 8). Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $2.4 million in 2005, relate to the refinancing of the Companys senior credit facilities. Such one time expenses included the write off of deferred debt issuance costs of $5.7 million partially offset by the settlement of interest rate swap agreements of $3.2 million. No such expenses were incurred in 2006. Other expenses, net, for 2006 and 2005 were $12.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($6.0 million in 2006 and $4.1 million in 2005), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($5.0 million in 2006 and $3.8 million in 2005), reflecting higher receivable fee rates in 2006 and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($2.1 million in 2006 and $1.5 million in 2005) primarily due to higher commitment fees offset by interest income ($0.7 million in 2006 and $0.4 million in 2005). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This pronouncement amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of SFAS No. 123, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that companies account for awards of equity instruments under the fair value method of accounting and recognize such amounts in their statements of operations. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method and, in connection therewith compensation expense is recognized in its consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the service period that the awards are expected to vest. The Company recognizes expense for all stock based compensation with graded vesting on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award. Stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, and estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recorded stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. The Company estimated the fair value of stock option awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and disclosed the resulting estimated compensation effect on net income on a pro forma basis. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 the Companys income before income taxes and net income was reduced by $9.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, or $.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 31.5% in 2006 and 33% in 2005. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Companys income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2006 by approximately $5.6 million or $.03 per share. 21 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $387.9 million, $289.6 million and $229.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the non cash components of working capital compared to the increase in 2006. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is also primarily attributable to an increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a higher increase in the non cash components of working capital compared to the increase in 2005. The non cash components of working capital increased $63.0 million in 2007 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $87.0 million, $23.7 million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements, $22.7 million in inventory and $7.2 of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a $43.7 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $33.9 million in accrued liabilities. The non cash components of working capital increased $69.4 million in 2006 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $60.6 million, $81.9 million in inventory, $10.0 million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements, $9.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accrued interest of $1.1 million partially offset by a $46.4 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $46.8 million in accrued liabilities. The non cash components of working capital increased $36.7 million in 2005 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable of $45.2 million and $20.6 million in inventory partially offset by a $25.8 million increase in accounts payable, a decrease of $10.4 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $5.0 million of receivables sold, an increase in accrued interest of $3.0 million, and a decrease of $5.6 million in prepaid expenses and other assets. In 2007, accounts receivable increased $126.6 million to $510.4 million, due to an increase in sales levels, $16.4 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 (Translation) and the remaining increase due to acquired companies. Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 69 days from 66 days in 2006 with Translation accounting for 1 day of the increase. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased $12.8 million to $72.9 million primarily from higher value added tax receivables related to foreign operations in addition to higher short term investment balances. Inventory increased $40.4 million to $456.9 million, primarily resulting from increased sales activity of $22.7 million as well as increases related to Translation and inventory from acquired companies of $11.5 million. Inventory days at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 80 and 86, respectively. Other long term assets decreased $16.5 million to $43.9 million primarily due to a reduction in long term deferred tax assets and a reduction of the fair value of interest rate swaps arrangements in addition to amortization of intangible assets. Goodwill increased $165.6 million to $1,091.8 million primarily as a result of acquisitions completed during the year, the payment of and recording of liabilities for performance based additional cash consideration of $24.6 million in addition to adjustments made related to prior year acquisitions. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $42.1 million to $316.2 million reflecting capital expenditures of $103.8 million, $10.1 million due to Translation as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $8.8 million offset by depreciation of $76.0 million and disposals of $4.6 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $60.5 million and $1.8 million to $295.4 million and $55.0 million, respectively, due primarily to an increase in sales levels as well as liabilities assumed from acquired companies and a $7.3 and $0.5 million increase, respectively, due to Translation. Other accrued liabilities increased $12.7 million to $169.1 million relating primarily to an increase of $32.6 million in liabilities associated with performance based additional cash consideration on acquisitions and an increase of $6.8 million due to Translation offset by a decrease in accrued income taxes of $23.4 million due primarily to the reclassification of the long term portion of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48 to long term liabilities of $28.8 million. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations decreased $36.5 million to $101.8 million primarily due to contributions made during 2007 and higher discount rate assumptions used in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 offset by an increase of $5.6 million due to Translation. Other long term liabilities increased $37.7 million to $67 million due primarily to the reclassification of the long term portion of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48 from other accrued expenses as discussed above in addition to higher long term deferred tax liabilities partially offset by a reduction in minority interest liabilities of $14.4 million due to the purchase of the remaining 30% of one of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. In 2007, cash from operating activities of $387.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $58.2 million, net borrowings of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.3 million were used to fund $179.3 million of acquisitions including payments for performance based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $103.8 million, purchases of treasury stock of $93.6 million, dividend payments of $10.7 million, purchases of short term investments of $1.4 million and an increase in cash on hand of $109.5 million. For 22 2006, cash from operating activities of $289.6 million, proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.9 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $31.9 million were used to fund capital expenditures of $82.4 million, acquisitions of $22.5 million, dividend payments of $10.7 million, a net debt reduction of $102.6 million, purchases of treasury stock of $72.7 million, payment of fees and expenses related to refinancing of $1.1 million and an increase in cash on hand of $35.5 million. On July 15, 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior secured credit facility. The new bank agreement (Revolving Credit Facility) was comprised of a five year $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010, of which approximately $440.0 million was drawn at closing. On November 15, 2005, the Company exercised its option to increase its aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional $250.0 million thereby increasing the revolving credit facility to $1,000.0 million. On August 1, 2006, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility to reduce borrowing costs and increase the general indebtedness basket by $250.0 million through an accordion feature similar to that exercised on November 15, 2005. In addition, the term of the Revolving Credit Facility was extended from July 2010 to August 2011. At December 31, 2007, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $274.6 million, after a reduction of $13.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. In connection with the 2005 refinancing, the Company incurred one time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million (less tax effects of $0.8 million), or $.01 per share after tax. Such one time expenses include the write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The Companys interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. At December 31, 2007, the Companys credit rating from Standard & Poors was BBB and from Moodys was Baa3. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) of higher than 3X and a leverage ratio (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.25X; at December 31, 2007, such ratios as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility were 15.46X and 1.21X, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, (i) indebtedness in excess of $50.0 million for capital leases, $450.0 million for general indebtedness, $200.0 million for acquisition indebtedness, (of which approximately $3.3 million, $1.1 million and $nil were outstanding at December 31, 2007, respectively), (ii) restricted payments including dividends on the Companys Common Stock in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income subsequent to July 15, 2005 plus $250.0 million, or approximately $605.7 million at December 31, 2007, (iii) required consolidated net worth equal to 50% of cumulative consolidated net income commencing April 1, 2005 plus 100% of net cash proceeds from equity issuances commencing April 1, 2005, plus $400.0 million, or approximately $784.4 million at December 31, 2007, (iv) creating or incurring liens, (v) making other investments, and (vi) acquiring or disposing of assets. In conjunction with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million, $250.0 million and $150.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.24%, 4.85% and 4.40%, expiring in July 2008, December 2008 and December 2009, respectively. In October 2007, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.73% and 4.65% which go into effect in July 2008 and December 2008 and expire in July 2010 and December 2009, respectively. The fair value of such agreements was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value of all swaps indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2007 would have resulted in a pre tax loss of $11.4 million; such loss, net of tax of $4.4 million, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Companys Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement described below. In addition, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $183.6 million and $74.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, the majority of which was in non U.S. accounts as of December 31, 2007. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. 23 The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2008 will be approximately $95.0 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. On January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it would commence payment of quarterly dividends on its common stock of $.015 per share. The Company paid its fourth 2007 quarterly dividend in the amount of $2.7 million or $.015 per share on January 2, 2008 to shareholders of record as of December 12, 2007. Cumulative dividends declared during 2007 were $10.7 million. Total dividends paid in 2007 were $10.7 million including those declared in 2006 and paid in 2007. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Companys business, repurchase of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Companys working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. On July 31, 2006, the Company terminated its then existing accounts receivable securitization facility and entered into a new Receivables Purchase Agreement (the New Agreement). The New Agreement allows the Company to sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable at costs that are lower than the previous agreement. The remaining terms and conditions of the New Agreement remained substantially the same as the previous facility. The New Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in July 2009. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $85.0 million of receivables were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. TCS Acquisition On December 1, 2005, pursuant to an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2005 (the Asset Purchase Agreement) by and among Amphenol Corporation (the Company) and Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (Teradyne), The Company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Teradynes backplane and connection systems business segment (TCS), including the stock of certain of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of approximately $384.7 million in cash. In addition, Amphenol incurred approximately $8.8 million of transaction related expenses. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes the results of TCS for the period subsequent to the acquisition date; sales of approximately $34.0 million and minimal net income resulting in no impact to 2005 consolidated net earnings per share. TCS results are reflected for the full year 2006 and 2007. TCS is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire and is a leading supplier of high speed, high density, printed circuit board interconnect products. TCS sells its products primarily to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets. TCS had sales of $373 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of TCS based upon their fair market values. The excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $240.0 million of goodwill and $46.2 million of acquired intangible assets of which $30.7 million, $9.5 million and $6.0 million was assigned to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, all of which are subject to amortization. The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted average useful life of approximately 12 years. The license agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships have a weighted average useful life of 8 years, 15 years and 5 years, respectively. The entire amount of goodwill was assigned to the interconnect segment all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information assuming that the TCS acquisition actually occurred as of the beginning of the period presented. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, TCS had sales and operating income of $373.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Such amounts along with $22.2 million of additional pro forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the acquisition are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCS acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Companys financial position 24 or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. For The Year Ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands except per share data) Net sales $ 2,146,286 Operating income 347,301 Net income 195,675 Net income per common share Basic $ 1.10 Net income per common share Diluted 1.08 To supplement the Companys pro forma combined financial information presented above, the Company uses certain measures which are adjusted from the Companys pro forma GAAP amounts based upon actions taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost structure, the results of which are as shown below. These adjustments are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Companys current and expected financial performance and are forward looking. The adjustments are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the Companys financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Such information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment. The following table sets forth cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring costs and non recurring gains on the sale of a business, which management does not expect to recur in the future. This information is included to assist investors and management in assessing the Companys operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Companys ongoing combined operations. For The Year Ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands) Benefit of reduction in employee related benefits (i) $ 1,969 Benefit of reduction in Teradyne historical corporate allocations (ii) 7,505 Reversal of nonrecurring restructuring costs (iii) 11,654 Reversal of nonrecurring gains on the sale of a business (iv) (612 ) Total $ 20,516 (i) In conjunction with the acquisition, TCSs historical management incentive plan was terminated and replaced by an incentive plan which has higher profitability targets. These targets would not have been achieved at TCSs historic profitability levels and, as such, the related expense would not have been incurred. (ii) Teradyne had historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to TCS which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. Such costs included information technology, human resources, tax, legal, corporate treasury and finance as well as executive administration related items. The acquisition agreement included the hiring of certain Teradyne employees and assumption of certain agreements that related to services performed by Teradyne for TCS. In addition, Amphenol assumed the performance of certain tax and treasury functions for TCS. This adjustment represents the excess of the amount charged to TCS by Teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost incurred by TCS and Amphenol since the acquisition. (iii) Teradyne had significant restructuring activities in 2005 at TCS resulting in related expenses which in included in the pro forma amounts presented above. No significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future, and as such, these costs are considered nonrecurring, and are therefore included above as expected savings. (iv) TCS had recognized gains on the sale of a business in 2005 which is included in the pro forma amounts presented above. These gains are not expected to occur in the future. 25 Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (Allied Signal) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (Honeywell)), Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites, the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the Sidney landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the Honeywell Agreement) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Stock Split On January 17, 2007, the Company announced a 2 for 1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as of March 16, 2007 and these additional shares were distributed on March 30, 2007. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, as a result of FASB Staff Position 157 2 issued in February 2008, and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of 2009. The Company does not believe SFAS 157 will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The objective is to provide entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not believe SFAS 159 will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 26 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, this Statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: 1.) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, 2.) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3.) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to this Statement are (1) that the Statement requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred (2) that any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performance based liability after its initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill, and (3) any liabilities related to noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement to determine the impact it will have, but believes the impact will not be material to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. This Statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this Statement is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to this Statement are (1) the Statement requires companies to classify expense related to noncontrolling interests share in income below net income (earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling interests share in net income of the Company as is current practice.) During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests share in income of $10.5 million, $6.0 million and $4.1 million, respectively, in other expenses, net and (2) this Statement requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 the liability related to noncontrolling interests was $14.8 million and $18.7 million, respectively, and is included in other long term liabilities. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement to determine the impact it will have, but believes the primary impact will be as described above. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan) covering their U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $16.0 million, $17.0 million and $13.5 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from its actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical eighteen year compounded return of 11.4%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 10.65%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8%. As of December 31, 2007, the asset allocation was 62% with equity managers and 31% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers and 7% in cash. The Company believes that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at December 31, 2007 and 2006 is 9.25% and 9.5%, respectively. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan on this basis has increased from 5.75% at December 31, 2006 to 6.25% at December 31, 2007. This will have the effect of decreasing pension expense in 2008 by approximately $2.2 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased $14.4 million or increased $15.0 million, respectively. 27 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing the unfunded pension liability by $5.1 million at December 31, 2006 and had the effect of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $1.7 million in 2007. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 158 which requires employers to fully recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet. The pension asset or liability under SFAS 158 is equal to the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and its projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans. Prior guidance required the liability to be measured as the accumulated benefit obligation. In addition, this statement requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet, with limited exceptions. SFAS 158 also requires entities to disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The statement was effective for years ending after December 15, 2006 except for the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end balance sheet which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. SFAS 158 had the effect of increasing the Companys accrued benefit obligation and other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax assets, by approximately $31.1 million and $19.2 million, respectively at December 31, 2006 and did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated statement of income. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $20 million and $15 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under all the Companys pension and post retirement benefit plans (the Plans) decreased in 2007 to $101.8 million from $138.3 million in 2006 primarily due to the cash contributions made to the Plans in 2007 as well as the higher discount rate assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 offset by the foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2008 of approximately $10.0 to $20.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the U.S. Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which was signed into law in August 2006. The intent of the legislation is to require companies to fund 100% of their pension liability; and then for companies to fund, on a going forward basis, an amount generally estimated to be the amount that the pension liability increases each year due to an additional year of service by the employees eligible for pension benefits. The legislation requires that funding shortfalls be eliminated by companies over a seven year period, beginning in 2008. The Pension Protection Act also extended the provisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act that would have expired in 2006 had the Pension Protection Act not been enacted, which increased the allowed discount rate used to calculate the pension liability. The Pension Protection Act is effective for plan years beginning after 2007 and the Company does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. 28 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2007, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt (1) $ 719,297 $ 489 $ 999 $ 717,730 $ 79 Capital lease obligations 3,339 586 1,632 618 503 Operating leases 70,427 20,691 28,390 13,995 7,351 Purchase obligations 153,928 151,359 1,600 969 Accrued acquisition related obligations (2) 55,212 55,212 Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (3) 40,582 3,832 7,982 8,361 20,407 Total (4) $ 1,042,785 $ 232,169 $ 40,603 $ 741,673 $ 28,340 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps. The actual interest payments made in 2007 were $36,238. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Accrued acquisition related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance based cash consideration. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Companys unfunded pension and post retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post retirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, but the Company has made contributions to the U.S. Plan in the range of $10,000 to $20,000 in each of the last few years and expects to make this same level of contribution in 2008. As a result, it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected asset returns. (4) As of December 31, 2007, the Company has FIN 48 liabilities of $33,037. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the non current FIN 48 liabilities it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these non current liabilities might be paid. 29 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million, $250.0 million and $150.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.24%, 4.85% and 4.40%, expiring in July 2008, December 2008 and December 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2007, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 4.56%. In October 2007, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.73% and 4.65% which go into effect in July 2008 and December 2008 and expire in July 2010 and December 2009, respectively. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2007 would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2008, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 30
