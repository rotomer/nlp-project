Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2008, approximately 64% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid electrical automotive applications; and commercial aerospace and military applications. The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales in 2008. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: Focus on customer needs Design and develop performance enhancing interconnect solutions Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure Maintain a culture of controlling costs Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $3,236.5 million, $632.2 million and $419.2 million, respectively; up 14%, 14% and 19%, respectively, from 2007. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in predominantly all of the Companys related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2008, the Company generated operating cash flow of $481.5 million. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.6 67.4 68.1 Selling, general and administrative expense 12.9 13.2 13.9 Casualty loss related to flood .8 Operating income 19.5 19.4 17.2 Interest expense (1.2 ) (1.3 ) (1.6 ) Other expenses, net (.3 ) (.5 ) (.5 ) Income before income taxes 18.0 17.6 15.1 Provision for income taxes (5.0 ) (5.2 ) (4.8 ) Net income 13.0 % 12.4 % 10.3 % 17 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales were $3,236.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $2,851.0 million for 2007, an increase of 14% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. The increase in sales in 2008 over 2007 excluding acquisitions was 10% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2008 (approximately 91% of net sales) increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($2,950.6 million in 2008 versus $2,569.3 million in 2007). Sales increased in all of the Companys major end markets, except automotive, including the wireless communications, military/aerospace, telecommunications and data communications and industrial markets. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $205.2 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market primarily relating to new products for mobile phones, increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and to a lesser extent increased sales to cell site installation customers. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $90.8 million, primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs, including war related spending, an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $53.9 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and network equipment for data centers as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $20.1 million) primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions as well as increased sales to the natural resource exploration and railway/mass transit markets. The automotive market was slightly down in 2008 (approximately $3.0 million) versus 2007 reflecting the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. Sales of cable products in 2008 (approximately 9% of net sales) increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($285.9 million in 2008 versus $281.8 million in 2007). Such increase is primarily due to the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2008 and 2007 were relatively flat ($1,159.3 million in 2008 versus $1,155.8 million in 2007); international sales for 2008 increased approximately 23% in U.S. dollars ($2,077.2 million in 2008 versus $1,695.2 million in 2007) and increased approximately 21% in local currency compared to 2007. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2008 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $34.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2007. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat at 32.4% in 2008 compared to 32.6% in 2007. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 0.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. Cable operating margins decreased 1.0% due primarily to the impact of higher material costs for the majority of 2008 partially offset by the impact of price increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $416.9 million and $377.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or approximately 13% of net sales in both 2008 and 2007. The increase in expense in 2008 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $5.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Selling and marketing expense remained approximately 6.5% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4% of sales for both 2008 and 2007, increased by approximately $16.1 million, due primarily to increases in stock based compensation expense of $3.9 million as well as cost increases relating to salaries and employee related benefits. Interest expense was $39.6 million for 2008 compared to $36.9 million for 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to the higher average debt levels in 2008. Other expenses, net for 2008 and 2007 were $10.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($10.4 million in 2008 and $10.5 million in 2007), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($3.1 million in 2008 and $5.2 million in 2007), and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($1.8 million in both 2008 and 2007) offset by interest income ($4.7 million in 2008 and $2.7 million in 2007). The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 28.0% in 2008 and 29.5% in 2007. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Companys income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2008 by approximately $8.7 million or $.04 per share. 18 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales were $2,851.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2,471.4 million for 2006, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. The increase in sales in 2007 over 2006 excluding acquisitions was 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2007 (approximately 90% of net sales) increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2006 ($2,569.3 million in 2007 versus $2,207.5 million in 2006). Sales increased in all of the Companys major end markets including the military/aerospace, wireless communications, industrial/automotive, and telecommunications and data communications markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $117.5 million primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs including war related spending, as well as an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $104.6 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products for both mobile phones and laptop computers, and to a lesser extent, to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and cell site installation customers. The increase in sales in the industrial/automotive market (approximately $77.0 million) primarily reflects increased new product sales to the European automotive market, increased sales to the natural resource exploration and factory automation markets as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $54.1 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and transmission equipment for data centers. Sales of cable products in 2007 (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 7% compared to 2006 ($281.8 million in 2007 versus $263.9 million in 2006). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2007 increased approximately 9% compared to 2006 ($1,155.8 million in 2007 versus $1,060.0 million in 2006); international sales for 2007 increased approximately 20% in U.S. dollars ($1,695.2 million in 2007 versus $1,411.5 million in 2006) and increased approximately 16% in local currency compared to 2006. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2007 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $66.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2006. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33% in 2007 compared to 32% in 2006. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. In addition, cable operating margins increased 0.7% due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of specialty products, increased production levels in low cost facilities and price increases partially offset by higher material costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $377.3 million and $342.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, or approximately 13% and 14% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in expense in 2007 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $8.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4% and 5% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, increased by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in stock based compensation expense of $2.7 million, and cost increases relating to professional fees as well as salaries and employee related benefits. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of 2006. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20.7 million, or $.08 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14, 2006. Production activity was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of 2006. As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0 million. Interest expense was $36.9 million for 2007 compared to $38.8 million for 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to the lower average debt levels in 2007. Other expenses, net, for 2007 and 2006 were $15.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($10.5 million in 2007 and $6.0 million in 2006), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($5.2 million in 2007 and $5.0 million in 2006), and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($1.8 million in 2007 and $2.0 million in 2006) offset by interest income ($2.7 million in 2007 and $0.7 million in 2006). 19 Table of Contents The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 29.5% in 2007 and 31.5% in 2006. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Companys income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2007 by approximately $10.0 million or $.05 per share. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $481.5 million, $387.9 million and $289.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2007. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2006. The components of working capital increased $40.0 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of $47.6 million, $21.3 million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements and $7.5 million of other current assets partially offset by a $32.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.7 million increase in accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts receivable. The components of working capital increased $63.0 million in 2007 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $87.0 million, $23.7 million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements, $22.7 million in inventory and $7.2 million of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a $43.7 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $33.9 million in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $69.4 million in 2006 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $60.6 million, $81.9 million in inventory, $10.0 million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements, $9.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accrued interest of $1.1 million partially offset by a $46.4 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $46.8 million in accrued liabilities. In 2008, accounts receivable increased $5.6 million to $516.0 million, due primarily to acquisitions during the period, partially offset by translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 (Translation). Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 72 days from 69 days in 2007. Inventory increased $55.6 million to $512.5 million, resulting from higher activity levels in 2008, an increase in inventory days, and inventory from acquired companies of $19.3 million, partially offset by $9.7 million of Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 88 and 80, respectively. The increase in inventory days resulted primarily from a slowdown in sales activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the well publicized global economic slowdown. The Company will continue to focus on inventory reduction as adjustments to production activity continue in response to lower demand levels. Other current assets increased $19.5 million to $92.4 million primarily due to an increase in deferred taxes. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $28.3 million to $344.5 million reflecting capital expenditures of $108.5 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $9.5 million offset by depreciation of $80.7 million, $7.5 million due to Translation and disposals of $1.5 million. Goodwill increased $140.5 million to $1,232.3 million primarily as a result of three acquisitions completed during the year, the payment of and recording of liabilities for performance based additional cash consideration of $131.7 million offset by adjustments made related to prior year acquisitions, and by Translation of $25.2 million and $14.1 million in intangible assets reclassified to other long term assets representing the fair value assigned to identifiable assets associated with the Companys acquisitions in 2007. Other long term assets increased $37.5 million to $81.4 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2008 acquisitions as well as the reclassification from goodwill discussed above related to 2007 acquisitions and an increase in long term deferred tax assets primarily associated with the increase in the accrued pension and post employment obligation, offset by amortization of the intangible asset balances. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $10.6 million and $4.7 million to $306.0 million and $59.6 million, respectively, due primarily to liabilities assumed from acquired companies offset by Translation. The other accrued liabilities including acquisition related obligations and accrued income taxes increased $99.7 million to $268.8 million relating primarily to an increase of $65.1 million in liabilities associated with performance based additional cash consideration on acquisitions and an increase in accrued income taxes of $26.2 million due primarily to an increase in liabilities related to foreign income taxes. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased $59.9 million to $161.7 million primarily due to a decrease in plan assets during the year resulting from equity market losses in 2008. Other long term liabilities decreased $4.8 million to $62.2 million due primarily to lower long term deferred tax liabilities offset by a higher minority interest liability at December 31, 2008. 20 Table of Contents In 2008, cash from operating activities of $481.5 million, net borrowings of $61.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $48.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $0.9 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $293.6 million, $135.8 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $108.3 million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, purchases of short term investments of $2.9 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $31.3 million. For 2007, cash from operating activities of $387.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $58.2 million, net borrowings of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.3 million were used to fund $179.3 million of acquisitions including payments for performance based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $103.8 million, purchases of treasury stock of $93.6 million, dividend payments of $10.7 million, purchases of short term investments of $1.4 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $109.5 million. The Companys senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is comprised of a five year $1,000.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in August 2011, of which $778.0 million was drawn at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $207.2 million, after a reduction of $14.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Companys interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Companys credit rating from Standard & Poors was BBB and from Moodys was Baa3. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had interest rate swap agreements of $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December 2009, December 2009 and July 2010, respectively. The fair value of such agreements represents the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value of swaps indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2008 would have resulted in a pre tax loss of $25.0 million; such loss, net of tax of $9.2 million, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Companys Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement described below. In addition, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $215.0 million and $183.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, the majority of which was in non U.S. accounts as of December 31, 2008. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2009 will be approximately $85 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share. Cumulative dividends declared during 2008 were $10.5 million. Total dividends paid in 2008 were $10.6 million, including those declared in 2007 and paid in 2008. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings not used for dividend payments to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Companys business, to repurchase shares of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Companys working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the Agreement). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in July 2009. Upon expiration, the Company intends to replace the Agreement with a similar program. Due to the short term nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates carrying value. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $85.0 million of receivables were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 21 Table of Contents Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (Allied Signal) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (Honeywell)), Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites, the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the Sidney landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the Honeywell Agreement) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has, to a significant degree, mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales, and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Stock Split On January 17, 2007, the Company announced a 2 for 1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as of March 16, 2007, and these additional shares were distributed on March 30, 2007. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). The objective of SFAS 141R is to improve the relevance and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (3) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 141R are: (1) that SFAS 141R requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred; (2) that any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performance based liability after its initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill; and (3) any noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value. SFAS 141R is effective for the Company for acquisitions completed on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). The objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The 22 Table of Contents presentation and disclosure requirements apply retrospectively for all periods presented. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 160 are: (1) SFAS 160 requires companies to classify expense related to noncontrolling interests share in income below net income (earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling interests share in net income of the Company as is the current practice). During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests share in income of $10.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively, in other expenses, net and (2) SFAS 160 requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the liability related to noncontrolling interests was $19.1 million and $14.8 million, respectively, and is included in other long term liabilities. The Company believes the primary impacts of SFAS 160 will be as described above. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations; and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To meet those objectives, SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company does not believe this pronouncement will significantly impact its disclosure requirements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan) covering certain of its U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $12.0 million, $16.0 million and $17.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical nineteen year compounded return of 8.5%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 9%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 6.8% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 6%. As of December 31, 2008, the asset allocation was 45% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers and 18% in cash. The Company believes that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at December 31, 2008 and 2007 is 8.25% and 9.25%, respectively. This reduction in the long term rate of return will have the effect of increasing 2009 pension expense by approximately $2.4 million. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan on this basis was 6.25% at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased by approximately $15.5 million. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan, which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $1.9 million and $1.7 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $20 million in both 2008 and 2007. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under all the Companys pension and post retirement benefit plans (the Plans) increased in 2008 to $165.9 million ($4.2 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be 23 Table of Contents made during 2009 for foreign plans) from $101.8 million in 2007 primarily due to a reduction in plan assets in the U.S. Plan offset by the cash contributions made to the Plans in 2008 and by the foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2009 of approximately $15 million to $20 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the U.S. Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which was signed into law in August 2006. The Pension Protection Act is effective for plan years beginning in 2008 and did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 24 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2008, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt (1) $ 784,601 $ 121 $ 778,951 $ 5,480 $ 49 Capital lease obligations 1,858 318 872 359 309 Operating leases 76,971 20,945 30,395 17,367 8,264 Purchase obligations 139,634 135,823 2,932 879 Accrued acquisition related obligations (2) 120,357 120,357 Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (3) 37,537 4,220 8,773 9,452 15,092 Total (4) $ 1,160,958 $ 281,784 $ 821,923 $ 33,537 $ 23,714 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps. The actual interest payments made in 2008 were $39,180. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Accrued acquisition related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance based cash consideration. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Companys unfunded pension and post retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post retirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, but the Company has made contributions to the U.S. Plan in the range of $15,000 to $20,000 in each of the last few years and expects to make this same level of contribution in 2009. As a result, it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected asset returns. (4) As of December 31, 2008, the Company has FASB Interpretation No. 48 liabilities of $38,058. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the non current FIN 48 liabilities it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these non current liabilities might be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2008, the Company had interest rate swap agreements that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December 2009, December 2009 and July 2010. At December 31, 2008, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 4.09%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2008 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.2 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2009, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 25 Table of Contents
