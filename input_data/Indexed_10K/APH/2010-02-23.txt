Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2009, approximately 64% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid electrical automotive applications; and commercial aerospace and military applications. The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales in 2009. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: Focus on customer needs Design and develop performance enhancing interconnect solutions Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure Maintain a culture of controlling costs Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $2,820.1 million, $488.9 million and $317.8 million, respectively; down 13%, 23% and 24%, respectively, from 2008. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products decreased in all of the Companys major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2009, the Company generated operating cash flow of $582.3 million. 15 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.6 67.6 67.4 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.1 12.9 13.2 Operating income 17.3 19.5 19.4 Interest expense (1.3 ) (1.2 ) (1.3 ) Early extinguishment of interest rate swaps (0.2 ) Other expenses, net (0.2 ) Income before income taxes 15.8 18.3 17.9 Provision for income taxes (4.2 ) (5.0 ) (5.2 ) Net income 11.6 13.3 12.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 11.3 % 13.0 % 12.4 % 16 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 Net sales were $2,820.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $3,236.5 million for 2008, a decrease of 13% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currencies and 16% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2009 (approximately 91% of net sales) decreased 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies compared to 2008 ($2,566.6 million in 2009 versus $2,950.6 million in 2008). Sales decreased in the Companys major end markets, including the industrial, telecommunications and data communications, automotive, wireless communications and military/aerospace markets as a result of the global economic downturn. The industrial market sales decreased (approximately $113.9 million) reflecting significantly lower demand for a broad range of industrial equipment including factory automation, natural resource exploration, heavy equipment and railway/mass transit. The telecommunications and data communications market sales decreased (approximately $164.8 million) primarily due to reduced sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment reflecting significantly lower enterprise and data center equipment demand. Sales to the automotive market decreased (approximately $42.3 million) primarily due to the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. The wireless communications market sales decreased (approximately $46.1 million) in primarily all areas, including the mobile device market, primarily related to lower handset demand and the wireless infrastructure market due to lower demand at base station/equipment manufacturers, partially offset by increased sales to cell site installation customers primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the military/aerospace markets decreased (approximately $20.8 million), primarily due to lower demand in the commercial aircraft market and to a lesser extent the defense market, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products in 2009 (approximately 9% of net sales) decreased 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to 2008 ($253.5 million in 2009 versus $285.9 million in 2008). This decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in spending in domestic and international broadband and cable television markets resulting from weak economic conditions. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2009 decreased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($1,001.7 million in 2009 versus $1,159.3 million in 2008) and decreased approximately 13% in local currencies. International sales for 2009 decreased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($1,818.3 million in 2009 versus $2,077.2 million in 2008) and decreased approximately 11% in local currencies compared to 2008. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $38.2 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2008. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.4% in 2009 compared to 32.4% in 2008. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of reduced volume levels given the current economic environment, partially offset by effective cost control programs. Cable operating margins increased 3.9% primarily as a result of the positive impacts of lower material costs and operational cost reduction actions, which more than offset the impact of lower sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $397.6 million and $416.9 million in 2009 and 2008, or approximately 14% and 13% of net sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and the positive effects of cost reduction actions. Selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately $12.9 million in 2009 due primarily to the lower sales volume and the impact on sales related costs such as freight and employee related costs. Research and development expenditures decreased approximately $4.1 million. Administrative expenses decreased approximately $2.3 million and represented approximately 5.0% and 4.5% of sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense was $36.6 million for 2009 compared to $39.6 million for 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average interest rates in 2009 partially offset by higher average debt levels. The Company incurred a $4.6 million charge (or $.02 per share) for the early extinguishment of certain interest rate swaps in 2009. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.7% in 2009 and 27.5% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 results primarily from a smaller decrease in income during 2009 in lower rate jurisdictions. 17 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales were $3,236.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $2,851.0 million for 2007, an increase of 14% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. The increase in sales in 2008 over 2007 excluding acquisitions was 10% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2008 (approximately 91% of net sales) increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($2,950.6 million in 2008 versus $2,569.3 million in 2007). Sales increased in all of the Companys major end markets, except automotive, including the wireless communications, military/aerospace, telecommunications and data communications and industrial markets. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $205.2 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market primarily relating to new products for mobile phones, increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and to a lesser extent increased sales to cell site installation customers. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $90.8 million, primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs, including war related spending, an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $53.9 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and network equipment for data centers as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $20.1 million) primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions as well as increased sales to the natural resource exploration and railway/mass transit markets. The automotive market was slightly down in 2008 (approximately $3.0 million) versus 2007 reflecting the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. Sales of cable products in 2008 (approximately 9% of net sales) increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($285.9 million in 2008 versus $281.8 million in 2007). Such increase is primarily due to the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2008 and 2007 were relatively flat ($1,159.3 million in 2008 versus $1,155.8 million in 2007); international sales for 2008 increased approximately 23% in U.S. dollars ($2,077.2 million in 2008 versus $1,695.2 million in 2007) and increased approximately 21% in local currency compared to 2007. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2008 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $34.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2007. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat at 32.4% in 2008 compared to 32.6% in 2007. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 0.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. Cable operating margins decreased 1.0% due primarily to the impact of higher material costs for the majority of 2008 partially offset by the impact of price increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $416.9 million and $377.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or approximately 13% of net sales in both 2008 and 2007. The increase in expense in 2008 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $5.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Selling and marketing expense remained approximately 6.5% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4.5% of sales for both 2008 and 2007, increased by approximately $16.1 million, due primarily to increases in stock based compensation expense of $3.9 million as well as cost increases relating to salaries and employee related benefits. Interest expense was $39.6 million for 2008 compared to $36.9 million for 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to the higher average debt levels in 2008. Other expenses, net for 2008 were not significant. Other expenses, net for 2007 were $4.5 million and are comprised primarily of program fees on the sale of accounts receivable of $5.2 million, and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities of $1.8 million offset by interest income of $2.7 million. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 27.5% in 2008 and 28.9% in 2007. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Companys income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2008 by approximately $8.3 million, or an additional $.04 per share. 18 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $582.3 million, $481.5 million and $387.9 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to decreases in the components of working capital compared to increases in these components in 2008 and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a decrease in net income. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2007. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $125.6 million in 2009 due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets of $96.6 million, $76.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, offset by a $31.7 million decrease in accounts payable, $16.1 million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements, a $3.0 million decrease in accounts receivable sold under the Companys receivable securitization program and a $2.6 million decrease in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $40.0 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of $47.6 million, $21.3 million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements and $7.5 million of other current assets partially offset by a $32.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.7 million increase in accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts receivable. The components of working capital increased $63.0 million in 2007 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $87.0 million, $23.7 million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements, $22.7 million in inventory and $7.2 million of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a $43.7 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $33.9 million in accrued liabilities. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2009. Accounts receivable decreased $66.4 million to $449.6 million, primarily reflecting the impact of lower sales levels and a reduction in days sales outstanding, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of $18.8 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 (Translation). Days sales outstanding decreased to approximately 64 days from 72 days in 2008. Inventory decreased $50.8 million to $461.8 million, primarily due to adjustments to production activity in response to lower demand levels offset by the impact of acquisitions of $20.1 million and Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 80 and 88, respectively. Other current assets increased $32.1 million to $124.4 million primarily due to higher short term investments purchases during 2009. Land and depreciable assets, net, decreased $11.6 million to $332.9 million reflecting capital expenditures of $63.1 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $10.0 million and Translation of $5.9 million offset by depreciation of $85.1 million and disposals of $5.5 million. Goodwill increased $136.3 million to $1,368.7 million primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during the year. Other long term assets increased $15.8 million to $97.2 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2009 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in long term deferred tax assets of $9.5 million. Accounts payable decreased $13.8 million to $292.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in purchasing activity during the year related to lower sales levels offset by the impact of acquisitions of $10.7 and Translation. Total accrued liabilities decreased $117.8 million, primarily as a result of payments and adjustments made related to accrued acquisition related obligations of $113.1 million as well as a decrease in accrued foreign income taxes. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased $10.6 million to $172.2 million due primarily to a higher projected benefit obligation as a result of a lower discount rate assumption offset by an increase in plan assets during the year. Other long term liabilities decreased $15.2 million to $27.9 million due to the reclassification of the fair value of short term interest rate swaps to other accrued expenses in 2009. In 2009, cash from operating activities of $582.3 million, proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $598.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $3.2 million were used to fund $280.0 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $63.1 million, purchases of short term investments of $33.3 million, payments to noncontrolling interests of $23.3 million, dividend payments of $10.3 million, net repayments of the Revolving Credit Facility and foreign debt of $631.9 million, costs related to the issuance of Senior Notes and the early extinguishment of interest rate swap agreements of $4.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $169.6 million. In 2008, cash from operating activities of $481.5 million, net borrowings of $61.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $48.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $0.9 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $293.6 million, $135.8 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance based additional cash consideration, 19 Table of Contents capital expenditures of $108.3 million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, purchases of short term investments of $2.9 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $31.3 million. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of unsecured 4.75% Senior Notes due in November, 2014 at a discount of 99.813% ($1.1 million unamortized at December 31, 2009). Net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Company incurred fees and expenses related to the Senior Notes of $4.7 million, which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2010. The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time by paying a make whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. In conjunction with the note issuance, the Companys existing five year senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in August 2011, was amended to reduce the commitment from $1,000.0 million to $752.0 million. At December 31, 2009, borrowings and availability under the facility were $150.0 million and $602.0 million, respectively. The Companys interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Companys credit rating from Standard & Poors was BBB and from Moodys was Baa3. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had interest rate swap agreements of $150.0 million that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate at 4.73%, expiring in July 2010. The fair value of such agreements represents the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value of swaps indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in a pre tax loss of $3.7 million; such loss, net of tax of $1.4 million, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. In conjunction with the repayment of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from the net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes, certain interest rate swap agreements were terminated and a one time charge of $4.6 million (or $.02 per share) was incurred related to the cost of such termination. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2010 will be approximately $80.0 to $100.0 million. The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share. Cumulative dividends declared and paid during 2009 were $10.3 million, including those declared in 2008 and paid in 2009. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement described below. In addition, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $422.4 million December 31, 2009, the majority of which was in non U.S. accounts. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. However, management believes that the Companys cash, cash equivalent and short term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the Accounts Receivable Agreement). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Accounts Receivable Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and was originally set to expire in July 2009. The Accounts Receivable Agreement was amended in May 2009 to extend the term of the agreement to May 2010. Upon expiration of the term, the Company intends to replace the Accounts Receivable Agreement with a similar program. Due to the short term nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates carrying value. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $82.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, of receivables were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable or debt balances in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective January 1, 2010, with the adoption of recent amendments to the Transfers and Servicing and 20 Table of Contents Consolidation Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the Company will report receivables sold under the Accounts Receivable Agreement, that as of December 31, 2009 were reported off balance sheet, as accounts receivable and short term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Recent Accounting Changes. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (Allied Signal) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (Honeywell)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites, the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the Sidney landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the Honeywell Agreement) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition in 1987, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse the Company 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has, to a significant degree, mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales, and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Stock Split On January 17, 2007, the Company announced a 2 for 1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as of March 16, 2007, and these additional shares were distributed on March 30, 2007. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In June 2009, FASB issued Statement No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which is a significant restructuring of accounting and reporting standards designed to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles by providing the authoritative literature in a topically organized structure. The Company has adopted the ASC, which became effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted amended standards set forth in the Consolidation Topic of the ASC. These standards require companies to classify expenses related to noncontrolling interests share in income below net income (earnings per share continues to be determined after the impact of the noncontrolling interests share in net income of the Company). In addition, these standards require the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within equity. The presentation and disclosure requirements of these standards were retroactively applied in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In connection with the adoption of these standards, the Company also changed the presentation of certain information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as well as on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow within operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. 21 Table of Contents The Subsequent Events Topic of the ASC provides general standards of accounting for, and disclosure of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular, these standards set forth: (1) the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, (2) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and (3) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. Certain standards within the Subsequent Events Topic regarding disclosure became effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted such standards, which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the accompanying financial statements were issued, which was February 23, 2010. In June 2009, the Transfers and Servicing Topic and the Consolidation Topic of the ASC were amended specifically in terms of transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities. These standards apply prospectively to financial asset transfers occurring in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009 to variable interest entities existing on or after November 15, 2009. The objective of the amendment to the Transfers and Servicing Topic of the ASC is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position; financial performance and cash flows; and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. This amendment eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs). As a result, a transferor must evaluate existing QSPEs to determine whether they must be consolidated in the reporting entitys financial statements. The objective of the amendment to the Consolidation Topic of the ASC is to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The Company evaluated the amendments discussed above, and as a result, the Company will report receivables sold under its receivable securitization agreement that are currently reported off balance sheet as accounts receivable and short term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets effective January 1, 2010. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, approximately $82.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, of receivables were sold and are not reflected in accounts receivable or debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fees associated with the Accounts Receivable Agreement, which are currently included in other expenses, net will be included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Companys credit ratios and ratings have always treated receivables sold under the Accounts Receivable Agreement as debt and therefore these ratios and ratings will be unaffected by the adoption of the amendment to this Topic. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan) covering certain of its U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering employees. The pension expense for pension plans approximated $16.5 million, $12.2 million and $16.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty year compounded return of approximately 10%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 9.5% and 40% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of 7.0%. As of December 31, 2009, the asset allocation was 59% with equity managers and 38% with fixed income managers and 3% in cash. The Company believes that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at both December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately 8.25%. 22 Table of Contents The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan on this basis was 5.75% at December 31, 2009 and 6.25% at December 31, 2008. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased by approximately $16.2 million. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan, which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $2.0 million and $1.9 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of nil and $20.0 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The U.S. Plan made benefit payments of $16.1 million and $16.5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under all the Companys pension and post retirement benefit plans (the Plans) increased in 2009 to $176.5 million ($4.2 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2010 for foreign plans) from $165.9 million in 2008 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2008 offset by an increase in plan assets in the U.S. Plan. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it may make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2010 of approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the U.S. Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units in accordance with ASC Topic 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other as of each June 30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments Interconnect Products and Assemblies and Cable Products, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. As of June 30, 2009, and for 23 Table of Contents each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the fair market value of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2009, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt (1) $ 752,010 $ $ 150,667 $ 601,126 $ 217 Interest related to Senior Notes 143,292 29,292 57,000 57,000 Capital lease obligations 1,439 399 548 492 Operating leases 73,803 22,254 29,723 16,062 5,764 Purchase obligations 120,277 117,442 2,835 Accrued acquisition related obligations (2) 7,244 7,244 Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (3) 40,313 4,220 8,731 9,398 17,964 Total (4) $ 1,138,378 $ 180,851 $ 249,504 $ 684,078 $ 23,945 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps. The actual interest payments made in 2009 were $38,532. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Accrued acquisition related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance based cash consideration. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Companys unfunded pension and post retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, so the Company did not make any such contributions in 2009. The Company may make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Plan in the range of $15,000 to $20,000 in 2010. As a result, it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (4) As of December 31, 2009, the Company has liabilities of $40,208 recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the non current liabilities, it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these non current liabilities might be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. 24 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2009, the Company had interest rate swap agreements that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.73%, expiring in July 2010. At December 31, 2009, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 4.73%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2009 would have no material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2010, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of unsecured Senior Notes at a discount of 99.813% due in November 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. 25 Table of Contents
