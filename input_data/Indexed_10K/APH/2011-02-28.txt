Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2010, approximately 65% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid electrical automotive applications; and commercial aerospace and military applications. The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 6% of net sales in 2010. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: Focus on customer needs; Design and develop performance enhancing interconnect solutions; Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities; Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure; Maintain a culture of controlling costs; and Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $3,554.1 million, $700.4 million and $496.4 million, respectively; up 26%, 43% and 56%, respectively, from 2009. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in all of the Companys major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2010, the Company generated operating cash flow of $506.9 million, before a reduction of $82.0 million from the January 1, 2010 adoption of the FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009 16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009 16)(refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein). 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.4 68.6 67.6 Selling, general and administrative expense 12.9 14.1 12.9 Operating income 19.7 17.3 19.5 Interest expense (1.2 ) (1.5 ) (1.2 ) Early extinguishment of interest rate swaps (0.2 ) Other income (expense), net 0.1 Income before income taxes 18.6 15.8 18.3 Provision for income taxes (4.5 ) (4.2 ) (5.0 ) Net income 14.1 11.6 13.3 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 14.0 % 11.3 % 13.0 % 17 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 Net sales were $3,554.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $2,820.1 million for 2009, an increase of 26% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 22% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2010 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 28% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currencies compared to 2009 ($3,293.1 million in 2010 versus $2,566.6 million in 2009). Sales increased in all of the Companys major end markets, including the telecommunications and data communications, wireless communications, industrial, military/aerospace and automotive markets as a result of a broad strengthening from a product, customer and geographic perspective and to a lesser extent from acquisitions. Sales to the telecommunications and data communi cations market increased (approximately $202.7 million) primarily due to increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment. The wireless communications market sales increased (approximately $181.3 million) in all areas, including the mobile device market, primarily related to higher handset and tablet computer demand and in the wireless infrastructure market due to higher cell site installation demand, which also drove higher demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $163.9 million) primarily reflecting increased sales to the geophysical and oil and gas, alternative energy, factory automation and instrumentation markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased (approximately $125.2 million), primarily due to higher demand in the defense market and to a lesser extent the commercial market. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $42.8 million) primar ily due to the increased demand in the European and U.S. automotive markets including the ramp up of new hybrid electric vehicle platforms. Sales of cable products in 2010 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 3% in U.S. dollars and were relatively flat in local currencies compared to 2009 ($261.0 million in 2010 versus $253.5 million in 2009), primarily attributed to an increase in spending in international broadband markets, partially offset by lower spending in North American broadband markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2010 increased approximately 26% both in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($1,258.2 million in 2010 versus $1,001.7 million in 2009) compared to 2009. International sales for 2010 increased approximately 26% both in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($2,296.0 million in 2010 versus $1,818.3 million in 2009) compared to 2009. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2010 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $1.1 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2009. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.6% in 2010 compared to 31.4% in 2009. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher volume levels combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of costs. Cable operating margins decreased 1.7% primarily as a result of higher relative material costs and the impact of market price reductions. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $457.9 million and $397.6 million in 2010 and 2009, or approximately 13% and 14% of net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in expense in 2010 is primarily attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $17.1 million in 2010 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employee costs. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $13.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2010 and 2009. Administrative expenses increased approximately $29.6 million, primarily related to an increase in stock based compensation expense, amortization of identified intangible assets and employee incentive payments, and represented approximately 5% of sales for both 2010 and 2009. Interest expense was $40.7 million for 2010 compared to $36.6 million for 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of fees of $1.5 million in 2010 on the Companys Receivables Securitization Facility in interest expense (included in other expense, net in 2009) in accordance with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009 16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009 16), which was effective January 1, 2010 (Note 3) and is also attributable to one time expenses of $0.5 million for the early extinguishment of the Companys previous credit facility (Note 3) and a full year of deferred debt issue costs in the 2010 related to the Senior Notes issuance in November 2009. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 24.3% in 2010 and 26.7% in 2009. The 2010 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of $20.7 million relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. The 2009 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Companys prior year tax returns. Excluding these adjustments, the Companys effective tax rate for 2010 and 2009 was 27.4% and 27.5%, respectively. The Company is present in over fifty taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 18 Table of Contents 2007 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Companys belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of December 31, 2010, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $23.3 million, the majority of which is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. Ba sed on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next twelve month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $4.8 million. 19 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 Net sales were $2,820.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $3,236.5 million for 2008, a decrease of 13% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currencies and 16% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2009 (approximately 91% of net sales) decreased 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies compared to 2008 ($2,566.6 million in 2009 versus $2,950.6 million in 2008). Sales decreased in the Companys major end markets, including the industrial, telecommunications and data communications, automotive, wireless communications and military/aerospace markets as a result of the global economic downturn. The industrial market sales decreased (approximately $113.9 million) reflecting significantly lower demand for a broad range of industrial equipment including factory automation, natural resource exploration, heavy equipment and railway/mass transit. The telecommunications and data communications market sales decreased (approximately $164.8 million) primarily due to reduced sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment reflecting significantly lower enterprise and data center equipment demand. Sales to the automotive market decreased (approximately $42.3 million) primarily due to the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. The wireless communications market sales decreased (approximately $46.1 million) in primarily all areas, including the mobile device market, primarily related to lower handset demand and the wireless infrastructure market due to lower demand at base station/equipment manufacturers, partially offset by increased sales to cell site installation customers primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the military/aerosp ace markets decreased (approximately $20.8 million), primarily due to lower demand in the commercial aircraft market and to a lesser extent the defense market, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products in 2009 (approximately 9% of net sales) decreased 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to 2008 ($253.5 million in 2009 versus $285.9 million in 2008). This decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in spending in domestic and international broadband and cable television markets resulting from weak economic conditions. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2009 decreased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($1,001.7 million in 2009 versus $1,159.3 million in 2008) and decreased approximately 13% in local currencies. International sales for 2009 decreased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($1,818.3 million in 2009 versus $2,077.2 million in 2008) and decreased approximately 11% in local currencies compared to 2008. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $38.2 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2008. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.4% in 2009 compared to 32.4% in 2008. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of reduced volume levels given the current economic environment, partially offset by effective cost control programs. Cable operating margins increased 3.9% primarily as a result of the positive impacts of lower material costs and operational cost reduction actions, which more than offset the impact of lower sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $397.6 million and $416.9 million in 2009 and 2008, or approximately 14% and 13% of net sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and the positive effects of cost reduction actions. Selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately $12.9 million in 2009 due primarily to the lower sales volume and the impact on sales related costs such as freight and employee related costs. Research and development expenditures decreased approximately $4.1 million. Administrative expenses decreased approximately $2.3 million and represented approximately 5.0% and 4.5% of sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense was $36.6 million for 2009 compared to $39.6 million for 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average interest rates in 2009 partially offset by higher average debt levels. The Company incurred a $4.6 million charge (or $.02 per share) for the early extinguishment of certain interest rate swaps in 2009. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.7% in 2009 and 27.5% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 results primarily from a smaller decrease in income during 2009 in lower rate jurisdictions and includes a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Companys prior year tax returns. 20 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow provided by operating activities was $424.9 million for 2010. Cash flow provided by operating activities was reduced by $82.0 million related to the effect of adoption of ASU 2009 16 (refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash flow provided by operating activities excluding the effect of adoption of ASU 2009 16 was $506.9 million compared to $582.3 million and $481.5 million 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding the effect of adoption, the decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to an increase in the components of working capital compared to decreases in these components in 2009 offset by an increase in net income and an increase in non cash expenses, including depreciation and stock based compensation expense. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to decreases in the components of working capital compared to increases in these components in 2008 and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a decrease in net income. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $120.1million in 2010 due primarily to a $157.7 million increase in accounts receivable, an increase of $65.2 million in inventory and an increase of $5.6 million in other current assets partially offset by a $76.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $31.5 million increase in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital decreased $125.6 million in 2009 due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets of $96.6 million, $76.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, offset by a $31.7 million decrease in accounts payable, a $3.0 million decrease in accounts receivable sold under the Companys receivable securitization program and a $2.6 million decrease in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $40.0 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of $47.6 million and other current assets of $7.5 million partially offset by a $32.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.7 million increase in accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts receivable. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2010. Accounts receivable increased $269.0 million to $718.5 million, resulting from the inclusion of $82.0 million of receivables previously sold under the Companys Receivables Securitization Facility in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2009 16 (refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and also reflecting higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $22.0 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 (Translation). (For further discussion of the adoption of ASU 2009 16, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 68 days from 64 days in 200 9. Inventory increased $87.4 million to $549.2 million, primarily due to the impact of higher sales activity, the impact of acquisitions of $18.8 million and Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 77 and 80, respectively. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $34.1 million to $367.0 million reflecting capital expenditures of $109.5 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $14.2 million and Translation offset by depreciation of $86.1 million and disposals. Goodwill increased $164.6 million to $1,533.3 million, primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during the year. Other long term assets increased $26.2 million to $123.4 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2010 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in long term deferred tax assets of $9.2 million. Accounts payable increased $92.8 million to $385.0 million primarily as a res ult of an increase in purchasing activity during the year related to higher sales levels and due to the impact of acquisitions of $14.8 million. Accrued acquisition related obligations increased $32.4 million to $39.6 million, primarily reflecting contingent consideration obligations of $39.6 million relating to an acquisition completed in 2010 partially offset by payments and adjustments to accrued acquisition related obligations relating to previous acquisitions. Other long term liabilities increased $14.0 million to $41.9 million, primarily due to contingent consideration obligations expected to be paid in 2012 associated with the aforementioned acquisition in 2010. In 2010, cash flow provided by operating activities of $424.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $61.3 million, net borrowings of $45.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $1.9 million were used to fund acquisition related payments of $180.4 million, capital expenditures of $109.5 million, purchases of short term investments of $60.2 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.6 million, dividend payments of $10.4 million, and to fund fees and expenses in connection with refinancing the Companys Revolving Credit Facility of $7.0 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $141.3 million. In 2009, cash flow provided by from operating activities of $582.3 million, proceeds from the issuance of Se nior Notes of $598.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $3.2 million were used to fund $280.0 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $63.1 million, purchases of short term investments of $33.3 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $23.3 million, dividend payments 21 Table of Contents of $10.3 million, net repayments of the Revolving Credit Facility and foreign debt of $631.9 million, costs related to the issuance of Senior Notes and the early extinguishment of interest rate swap agreements of $4.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $169.6 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $624.2 million and $422.4 million, respectively. The majority of these amounts are located outside of the U.S. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million in principal amount of its unsecured 4.75% Senior Notes due in November 2014 (the Senior Notes) at 99.813% of their face value ($0.9 million unamortized at December 31, 2010). Net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Companys senior credit facility. In addition, the Company incurred fees and expenses related to the Senior Notes of $4.7 million, which were deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the Senior Notes as interest expense. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time by paying a make whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. The fair value of the Senior Notes at December 31, 2010 was approximately $638.7 million based on recent bid prices. In August 2010, the Company refinanced its senior credit facility. The new $1,000.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) matures in August 2014. The net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay $247.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Companys previous senior unsecured credit facility. At December 31, 2010, borrowings and availability under the facility were $103.6 million and $896.4 million, respectively. The Companys interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 225 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and commitment fees. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with such financial covenants. In conne ction with the refinancing, the Company incurred one time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $0.5 million relating to unamortized deferred debt issue costs. These costs are included in interest expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also paid fees and expenses of $6.9 million in conjunction with the new Revolving Credit Facility, which are deferred and amortized into interest expense through its maturity. A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the Receivables Securitization Facility). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Receivables Securitization Facility includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in May 2013. In accordance with previous accounting guidance, the receivables sold under the Receivables Securitization Facility were accounted for off balance sheet as a sale of receivables. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted ASU 2009 16 on January 1, 2010. As a result, the Company no longer accounts for the value of the outstanding u ndivided interest held by investors under the Receivables Securitization Facility as a sale. In addition, transfers of receivables occurring on or after January 1, 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors at December 31, 2010 is accounted for as a secured borrowing and is included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as long term debt. At December 31, 2010, borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility were $92.0 million. At December 31, 2009, $82.0 million of receivables were sold and were therefore not reflected in accounts receivable and long term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, in accordance with ASU 2009 16, fees incurred in connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, which were included in other expense, net for prior periods, are now included in interest expense. Such fe es were approximately $1.5 million for both 2010 and 2009. The carrying value of the Companys Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility approximated their fair value at December 31, 2010. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2011 will be approximately $120.0 to $140.0 million. The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share. Cumulative dividends declared and paid during 2010 were $10.4 million, including those declared in 2009 and paid in 2010. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Receivables Securitization Facility and cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. The Company expects that ongoing cash 22 Table of Contents requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. However, management believes that the Companys cash, cash equivalents and short term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. The Company had an open market stock repurchase program (the Program) to repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock which expired on January 31, 2010. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock under the Program or otherwise in 2010. In January 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the three year period ending January 31, 2014. The price and timing of any such purchases will depend on factors such as debt levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (Allied Signal) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (Honeywell)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites, the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the Sidney landfill. All of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the Honeywell Agreement) entered into in connection with the acquisi tion in 1987. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts; shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has, to a significant degree, mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales, and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 16, which limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferors continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. The Company adopted ASU 2009 16 on January 1, 2010. As a result, the Company no longer accounts for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the Companys Receivables Securitization Facility as a sale. In addition, transfers of receivables occurring on or after January 1, 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow (resulting in a reduction of cash flow provided by operating activities, and increase in cash provided by financing activities, of $82.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010) and recognized as long term debt in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to the discussion of the Companys Receivables Securitization Facility in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance to enhance disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements by requiring certain new disclosures and clarifying certain existing disclosures. This new guidance requires disclosure of the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 recurring fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers. In addition, the new guidance requires additional information related to activities in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair 23 Table of Contents value measurements. The new guidance also expands the disclosures related to the disaggregation of assets and liabilities and information about inputs and valuation techniques. The new guidance related to Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009 and the new guidance related to Level 3 fair value measurements was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and interim periods during those fiscal years. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the new guidance related to Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements. The Companys adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related notes. Refer to the Fair Value Measurements disclosure in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have two defined benefit pension plans (U.S. Plans), which subject to the curtailment described below, cover its U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the International Plans). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and International Plans (the Plans) approximated $18.0 million, $16.5 million and $12.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted average discount rate, rate increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long term rate of return on the respective Plans assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 5.20% at December 31, 2010 and 5.75% at December 31, 2009. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately $19.8 million. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty year compounded return of approximately 10%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plans assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of approximately 9% and 40% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of approximately 7%. As of December 31, 2010, the asset allocation was 59% with equity managers and 36% with fixed income managers and 5% in cash. As of December 31, 2009, the asset allocation was 59% with equity managers and 38% with fixed income managers and 3% in cash. The Company believes that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plans at both December 31, 2010 and 2009 is approximately 8.25%. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to one of the U.S. Plans, which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years of service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $2.2 million and $2.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $17.3 million and $2.6 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under the Companys pension and post retirement benefit plans increased in 2010 to $179.9 million ($3.3 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2011 for unfunded foreign plans) from $176.5 million in 2009 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2009 offset by an increase in plan assets. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the Plans in 2011 of approximately $19.4 million, the majority of which is related to the U.S. Plans. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective Plans assets. 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 7% of consoli dated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units in accordance with ASC topic Intangibles Goodwill and Other as of each June 30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments Interconnect Products and Assemblies and Cable Products, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of testing would be performed to measure the imp airment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test would require the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required. As of June 30, 2010, and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the fair market value of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more like ly than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2010, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 799,992 $ 352 $ 92,548 $ 706,252 $ 840 Interest related to Senior Notes 114,000 28,500 57,000 28,500 Operating leases 83,526 24,988 33,483 16,278 8,777 Purchase obligations 166,019 163,023 2,996 Accrued acquisition related obligations (2) 59,000 40,000 19,000 Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (3) 50,809 17,122 10,740 8,384 14,563 Total (4) $ 1,273,346 $ 273,985 $ 215,767 $ 759,414 $ 24,180 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Facility from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility in 2010 were $11.1 million. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underl ying revolver balance. (2) Accrued acquisition related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance based cash consideration. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Companys unfunded pension and post retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, however, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $15 million in 2010. The Company anticipates making a contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $15 million in 2011. An anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately $13 million was included in the above table related to the U.S. Plans for 2011. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2011 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (4) As of December 31, 2010, the Company has non current liabilities of approximately $23.3 million recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the ASC. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2010, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 0.28%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2010 would have no material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2011, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 26 Table of Contents In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of the Senior Notes at 99.813% of their face value due in November 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. 27 Table of Contents
