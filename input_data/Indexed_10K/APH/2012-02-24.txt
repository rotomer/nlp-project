Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2011, approximately 68% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: information technology and communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid electrical automotive applications; and commercial aerospace and military applications. The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: Focus on customer needs; Design and develop performance enhancing interconnect solutions; Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities; Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure; Maintain a culture of controlling costs; and Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $3,939.8 million, $751.7 million and $524.2 million, respectively; up 11%, 7% and 6%, respectively, from 2010. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2011, the Company generated operating cash flow of $565.2 million. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.4 67.4 68.6 Casualty loss related to flood 0.5 Change in contingent acquisition related obligations (0.5 ) Acquisition related expenses 0.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.4 12.9 14.1 Operating income 19.1 19.7 17.3 Interest expense (1.1 ) (1.2 ) (1.3 ) Early extinguishment of interest rate swaps (0.2 ) Other income (expense), net 0.2 0.1 Income before income taxes 18.2 18.6 15.8 Provision for income taxes (4.8 ) (4.5 ) (4.2 ) Net income 13.4 14.1 11.6 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.3 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 13.3 % 14.0 % 11.3 % 18 Table of Contents 2011 Compared to 2010 Net sales were $3,939.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $3,554.1 million for 2010, an increase of 11% in U.S. dollars, 9% in local currencies and 6% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2011 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 11% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 7% organically compared to 2010 ($3,666.0 million in 2011 versus $3,293.1 million in 2010) driven by strength in the wireless devices, automotive, industrial, and commercial aerospace markets. Sales to the wireless devices market increased (approximately $195.4 million), primarily due to increased smart wireless device and tablet computer demand. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $101.0 million) driven primarily by new electronics applications as well as from the impact of two acquisitions made during the year. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $71.3 million), primarily reflecting increased sales to alternative energy, oil and gas and heavy equipment markets. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $36.0 million), primarily due to higher airplane production volumes as well as next generation jet liner production. This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military aerospace market (approximately $9.5 million), primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties and also due to the approximately $18.0 million business interruption impact from the flood at the Companys Sidney, New York facility in early September 2011 as further described below (the Flood Impact), partially offset by acquisition growth from a 2010 acquisition and a reduction in sales to the wireless infrastructure market (approximately $21.7 million), primarily due to slowed demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Sales of cable products in 2011 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2010 ($273.7 million in 2011 versus $261.0 million in 2010), primarily due to increased spending in South American wireless infrastructure markets during the year, partially offset by lower spending in broadband communications markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2011 increased approximately 1% ($1,268.9 million in 2011 versus $1,258.2 million in 2010) compared to 2010. International sales for 2011 increased approximately 16% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies ($2,670.9 million in 2011 versus $2,296.0 million in 2010) compared to 2010 with particular strength in Asia. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2011 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $59.6 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2010. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.6% in 2011 compared to 32.6% in 2010. The operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment decreased approximately 0.5% compared to the prior year, as a result of the impacts of increases in input costs primarily due to higher commodity prices. These impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases. The operating margins for the Cable Products segment decreased 0.9%, primarily as a result of higher relative material costs. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State in early September 2011. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company recorded a charge of $21.5 million ($13.5 million after taxes), for property related damage, as well as cleanup and repair efforts incurred through December 31, 2011, net of insurance recoveries. This charge includes the Companys loss for damaged inventory and machinery and equipment. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity primarily during the third quarter of 2011, but the plant was substantially back to full production by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company reassessed, based on current 2011 performance expectations, a contingent acquisition related obligation which would have been payable in 2012 related to a 2010 acquisition (Note 3). Performance expectations were reduced as a result of a softening in demand in the defense market and the related deferral of certain defense related programs to periods beyond 2011 and therefore outside the contractual earn out period. Therefore, it was determined that the payment related to 2011 profitability levels was no longer probable and the Company adjusted the remaining contingent consideration liability of $17.8 million as a gain in operating income as separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Based on the actual 2011 results of the acquired company, it has been determined that the 2012 contingent consideration payment is in fact not payable. This adjustment had an impact of $11.2 million on net income, or $0.06 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2011. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $2.0 million of acquisition related expenses in 2011 in connection with an acquisition made in the fourth quarter in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $486.3 million and $457.9 million in 2011 and 2010, or approximately 12% and 13% of net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $10.4 million in 2011 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employee related costs. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $11.3 million in 2011, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2011 and 2010. Administrative expenses increased approximately $6.7 million in 2011, primarily related to increases in stock based compensation expense, salaries and employee related benefits and amortization of acquisition related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 5% of sales for both 2011 and 2010. 19 Table of Contents Interest expense was $43.0 million for 2011 compared to $40.7 million for 2010. The increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the Companys stock repurchase program (Note 7), partially offset by lower average borrowing costs. Other income, net, was $8.1 million for 2011 compared to $4.1 million for 2010, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.2% in 2011 and 24.3% in 2010. The 2011 and 2010 tax rates reflect a reduction in tax expense of $4.5 million and $20.7 million, respectively, relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. Excluding these adjustments, the Companys effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 was 26.8% and 27.4%, respectively. The Company operates in over sixty tax jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2008 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Companys belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $21.9 million, the majority of which is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. Based on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next twelve month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $3.8 million. 20 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 Net sales were $3,554.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $2,820.1 million for 2009, an increase of 26% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 22% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2010 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 28% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currencies compared to 2009 ($3,293.1 million in 2010 versus $2,566.6 million in 2009). Sales increased in all of the Companys major end markets, including the telecommunications and data communications, wireless communications, industrial, military/aerospace and automotive markets as a result of a broad strengthening from a product, customer and geographic perspective and to a lesser extent from acquisitions. Sales to the telecommunications and data communications market increased (approximately $202.7 million) primarily due to increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment. The wireless communications market sales increased (approximately $181.3 million) in all areas, including the wireless device market, primarily related to higher handset and tablet computer demand and in the wireless infrastructure market due to higher cell site installation demand, which also drove higher demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $163.9 million) primarily reflecting increased sales to the geophysical and oil and gas, alternative energy, factory automation and instrumentation markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased (approximately $125.2 million), primarily due to higher demand in the defense market and to a lesser extent the commercial market. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $42.8 million) primarily due to the increased demand in the European and U.S. automotive markets including the ramp up of new hybrid electric vehicle platforms. Sales of cable products in 2010 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 3% in U.S. dollars and were relatively flat in local currencies compared to 2009 ($261.0 million in 2010 versus $253.5 million in 2009), primarily attributed to an increase in spending in international broadband communications markets, partially offset by lower spending in North American broadband communications markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2010 increased approximately 26% ($1,258.2 million in 2010 versus $1,001.7 million in 2009) compared to 2009. International sales for 2010 increased approximately 26% both in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($2,296.0 million in 2010 versus $1,818.3 million in 2009) compared to 2009. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2010 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $1.1 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2009. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.6% in 2010 compared to 31.4% in 2009. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher volume levels combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of costs. Cable operating margins decreased 1.7% primarily as a result of higher relative material costs and the impact of market price reductions. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $457.9 million and $397.6 million in 2010 and 2009, or approximately 13% and 14% of net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in expense in 2010 is primarily attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $17.1 million in 2010 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employee costs. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $13.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2010 and 2009. Administrative expenses increased approximately $29.6 million, primarily related to an increase in stock based compensation expense, amortization of identified intangible assets and employee incentive payments, and represented approximately 5% of sales for both 2010 and 2009. Interest expense was $40.7 million for 2010 compared to $36.6 million for 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of fees of $1.5 million in 2010 on the Companys Receivables Securitization Facility in interest expense (included in other expense, net in 2009) in accordance with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009 16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009 16), which was effective January 1, 2010 (Note 2) and is also attributable to one time expenses of $0.5 million for the early extinguishment of the Companys previous credit facility and a full year of deferred debt issue costs in the 2010 related to the Senior Notes issuance in November 2009. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 24.3% in 2010 and 26.7% in 2009. The 2010 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of $20.7 million relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. The 2009 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Companys prior year tax returns. Excluding these adjustments, the Companys effective tax rate for 2010 and 2009 was 27.4% and 27.5%, respectively. The Company operates in over fifty tax jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2007 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Companys belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of 21 Table of Contents December 31, 2010, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $23.3 million, the majority of which is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow provided by operating activities was $565.2 million for 2011 compared to $424.9 million for 2010. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the 2010 period includes the effect of adoption of FASB ASU 2009 16, which became effective January 1, 2010 and resulted in a decrease to cash flow provided by operating activities of $82.0 million in 2010. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2011 compared to 2010 (excluding the effect of adoption of ASU 2009 16 in 2010) is primarily due to increases in net income and non cash expenses, including a casualty loss related to the flood, depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation, as well as a decrease in other long term assets primarily related to deferred income taxes, partially offset by an increase in components of working capital and a non cash change in contingent acquisition related obligations. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $110.3 million in 2011 due primarily to increases in inventory, accounts receivable, and other current assets of $88.5 million, $9.7 million, $8.9 million, respectively, and a decrease of $27.5 million in accounts payable, partially offset by a $24.3 million increase in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $120.1 million in 2010 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $157.7 million, $65.2 million, $5.6 million, respectively, partially offset by a $76.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $31.5 million increase in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital decreased $125.6 million in 2009 due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets of $96.6 million, $76.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, partially offset by a $31.7 million decrease in accounts payable, a $3.0 million decrease in accounts receivable sold under the Companys receivable securitization program and $2.6 million decrease in accrued liabilities. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2011. Accounts receivable increased $48.6 million to $767.2 million resulting from higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $34.8 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 (Translation). Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 71 days from 68 days in 2010. Inventory increased $100.7 million to $649.9 million, primarily due to the impact of higher sales activity, a planned increase in certain raw materials due to expected increases in commodity prices, the increase of certain inventory to support first quarter 2012 sales and the impact of acquisitions of $19.0 million. Inventory days at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 89 and 77, respectively. Other current assets increased $15.1 million to $115.3 million, primarily due to an increase in the fair value of a foreign exchange forward contract as well as increases in VAT related receivables and deferred taxes. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $13.5 million to $380.5 million reflecting capital expenditures of $100.2 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $28.5 million offset by depreciation of $101.6 million and disposals of $13.2 million, which included a write off of certain flood damaged assets. Goodwill increased $212.8 million to $1,746.1 million, primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during the year. Other long term assets increased $13.9 million to $137.4 million, primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2011 acquisitions. Accounts payable decreased $7.1 million to $377.9 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in days payable and also due to accelerated payments for certain commodities, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of $13.4 million and Translation. Total accrued expenses decreased $5.4 million to $264.3 million, primarily due to the payment of acquisition related contingent consideration of $40.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes of $22.0 million and Translation. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased $30.4 million due primarily to an increase in the projected benefit obligation as a result of a lower discount rate assumption. Other long term liabilities decreased $7.8 million to $34.1 million, primarily due to the reduction in an acquisition related contingent payment obligation of $17.8 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities. In 2011, cash flow provided by operating activities of $565.2 million, net borrowings of $569.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $32.1 million, proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets of $8.1 million, and the change in cash and cash equivalents of $10.8 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $672.2 million, acquisition related payments of $303.3 million, capital expenditures of $100.2 million, contingent acquisition related obligation payments of $40.0 million, net purchases of short term investments of $35.5 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $30.0 million and dividend payments of $10.3 million. In 2010, cash flow provided by operating activities of $424.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements of $61.3 million, net borrowings of $45.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $1.9 million were used to fund acquisition related payments of $180.4 million, capital expenditures of $109.5 million, net purchases of short term investments of $60.2 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.6 million, dividend payments of $10.4 million, and to fund fees and expenses in connection with refinancing the Companys Revolving Credit Facility of $7.0 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $141.3 million. 23 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $648.9 million and $624.2 million, respectively. The majority of these amounts are located outside of the U.S. The Company does not intend to repatriate these funds. However, any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million principal amount of unsecured 4.75% Senior Notes due November 2014 (the 4.75% Senior Notes) at 99.813% of their face value. Interest on the 4.75% Senior Notes is payable semi annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 4.75% Senior Notes at any time by paying a make whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The 4.75% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. The fair value of the 4.75% Senior Notes at December 31, 2011 was approximately $643.0 million based on recent bid prices. In January 2012, the Company issued $500.0 million principal amount of unsecured 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (the 4.00% Senior Notes) at 99.746% of their face value. Net proceeds from the sale of the 4.00% Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility. Interest on the 4.00% Senior Notes is payable semi annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2012, to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 4.00% Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, plus a make whole premium (if redeemed prior to November 1, 2021). The 4.00% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. In June 2011, the Company amended its $1,000.0 million unsecured credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) to reduce borrowing costs and to extend the maturity date from August 2014 to July 2016. At December 31, 2011, borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility were $692.4 million and $307.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was at a spread over LIBOR. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company paid fees and expenses of approximately $2.1 million related to the amendment, which were deferred and are being amortized as interest expense through the amended maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. A subsidiary of the Company has entered into a Receivables Securitization Facility with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the Receivables Securitization Facility). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Receivables Securitization Facility includes certain covenants, provides for various events of termination. In accordance with previous accounting guidance, the receivables sold under the Receivables Securitization Facility were accounted for off balance sheet as sales of receivables. The Company adopted FASB ASU 2009 16 on January 1, 2010. As a result, the Company no longer accounts for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the Receivables Securitization Facility as a sale. In addition, transfers of receivables occurring on or after January 1, 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 is accounted for as a secured borrowing and is included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as long term debt. At December 31, 2011, borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility were $81.7 million. Additionally, in accordance with ASU 2009 16, fees incurred in connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility are included in interest expense. Such fees were approximately $1.6 million, $1.5 million, and $1.5 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In January 2012, the Company amended the Receivable Securitization Facility to reduce certain fees and amend the expiration date to January 2013. The carrying value of borrowings under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility approximated their fair value at December 31, 2011. The Company had $24.9 million of issued and unused letters of credit at December 31, 2011. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2012 will be approximately $110 to $130 million. On January 26, 2012, the Companys Board of Directors approved the first quarter 2012 dividend on its common stock in the amount of $.105 per share. This represents an increase in the quarterly dividend from $.015 to $.105 per share effective with the first quarter 2012 dividend, which will be paid in April 2012. Cumulative dividends declared and paid during 2011 were $10.3 million, including those declared in 2010 and paid in 2011. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility. 24 Table of Contents The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Receivables Securitization Facility and cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. The Company expects that ongoing cash requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable. However, management believes that the Companys cash, cash equivalents and short term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. In January 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the three year period ending January 31, 2014 (the Program). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Company repurchased 13.4 million shares of its common stock for approximately $672.2 million. These treasury shares have been or will be retired by the Company and common stock and accumulated earnings were reduced accordingly. The price and timing of any such purchases under the Program after December 31, 2011 will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. As of December 31, 2011, 6.6 million shares of common stock may be repurchased under the Program. Through February 17, 2012, the Company has repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares of its common stock for $60.2 million. At February 17, 2012, approximately 5.5 million additional shares of common stock may be repurchased under the Program. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (Allied Signal) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (Honeywell)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites, the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the Sidney landfill. All of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the Honeywell Agreement) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts; shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in the communications related markets, this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. 25 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASU 2011 08), which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011 08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will consider this update when performing its annual impairment assessment in the third quarter of 2012. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011 05). ASU 2011 05 requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements. It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. ASU 2011 05 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and is applied retrospectively. The Company has adopted this update and presented the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income immediately following the Consolidated Statements of Income. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011 04). ASU 2011 04 improves comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011 04 clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including (1) the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts, (2) measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entitys shareholders equity, and (3) quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2011 04 also provides guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio, and application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement. In addition, ASU 2011 04 requires additional disclosure for Level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs. The amendments in this guidance are to be applied prospectively, and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its financial statements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have two defined benefit pension plans (U.S. Plans), which, cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the International Plans). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and International Plans (the Plans) approximated $19.1 million, $18.0 million and $16.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted average discount rate, rate increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long term rate of return on the respective Plans assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 4.45% at December 31, 2011 and 5.20% at December 31, 2010. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately $21.0 million. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty year compounded return of approximately 9%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plans assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long term rate of return of approximately 9% and 40% with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of approximately 7%. As of December 31, 2011, the asset allocation was 62% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers and 1% in cash. As of December 31, 2010, the asset allocation was 59% with equity managers and 36% with fixed income managers and 5% in cash. The Company believes that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted 26 Table of Contents allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plans at both December 31, 2011 and 2010 is approximately 8.25%, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $22.8 million and $17.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under the Companys pension and post retirement benefit plans increased in 2011 to $210.3 million ($3.2 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2012 for unfunded foreign plans) from $179.9 million in 2010 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2010. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the Plans in 2012 of approximately $26.0 million, most of which is related to the U.S. Plans. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective Plans assets. The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company provided matching contributions of approximately $2.5 million and $2.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers. In the broadband communications market (approximately 7% of consolidated sales in 2011), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units as of each June 30. The Company has determined that its reporting units are its two reportable business segments Interconnect Products and Assemblies and Cable Products, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test would require the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required. As of June 30, 2011, and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized. 27 Table of Contents Defined Benefit Plan Obligation The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2011, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $2.1 billion. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries could bring additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2011, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 1,377,129 $ 298 $ 682,135 $ 694,696 $ Interest related to 4.75% Senior Notes 85,500 28,500 57,000 Operating leases 74,441 27,315 32,172 13,482 1,472 Purchase obligations 168,991 167,295 1,696 Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (2) 56,315 25,721 8,503 8,042 14,049 Total (3) $ 1,762,376 $ 249,129 $ 781,506 $ 716,220 $ 15,521 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Facility from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility in 2011 were $13.7 million, including amortization of the fees related to the amendment of the Revolving Credit Facility. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Companys unfunded pension and post retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, however, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $20.0 million in 2011. An anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately $21.2 million was included in the above table related to the U.S. Plans for 2012. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2012 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (3) As of December 31, 2011, the Company has non current liabilities of approximately $21.9 million recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. 29 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had foreign currency rate protection in the form of forward contracts that effectively fixed a Hong Kong dollar denominated intercompany debt obligation of 1,202.3 million Hong Kong dollars into a fixed euro denominated obligation expiring in November 2012 concurrent with the underlying loan. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk Outstanding borrowings under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility are subject to floating interest rates, primarily LIBOR. At December 31, 2011, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 0.29%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2011 would have no material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2012, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of 4.75% Senior Notes at 99.813% of their face value due in November 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. In January 2012, the Company issued $500.0 million of 4.00% Senior Notes at 99.746% of their face value due in February 2022 with a fixed interest rate of 4.00%. Proceeds were used to repay borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 30 Table of Contents
