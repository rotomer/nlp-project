Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to help investors understand Apollo Group, Inc. (the Company, Apollo Group, Apollo, APOL, we, us, or our), our operations, and our present business environment. The MDA is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes (Notes). The following overview provides a summary of the sections included in our MDA: Forward Looking Statements cautionary information about forward looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations or projections. Executive Summary a general description of our business and the education industry, as well as key highlights of the current year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. Results of Operations an analysis of our results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. We operate in one business sector: education. Except to the extent that differences between our reportable segments are material to an understanding of our business as a whole, we present the discussion in our MDA on a consolidated basis. Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Financial Position an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, commitments and contingencies, seasonality in the results of our operations, the impact of inflation, and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. Forward Looking Statements This MDA contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements include, among others, those statements regarding future events and future results of the Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and the beliefs and assumptions of us and our management, and speak only as of the date made and are not guarantees of future performance. In some cases, forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, will, should, believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, plans, predicts, targets, potential, continue, objectives, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Such forward looking statements are necessarily estimates based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such statements should be viewed with caution. Actual events or results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by us include but are not limited to: changes in the regulations of the education industry, including those items set forth in Item 1 under the sections titled Regulatory Environment, Accreditation, Federal Financial Aid Programs, and State Authorization; each of the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors; those factors set forth in Item 7; and changes in the requirements surrounding the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The cautionary statements referred to in this section also should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward looking statements that may be issued by us or persons acting on our behalf. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, or any facts, events, or 45 Table of Contents circumstances after the date hereof that may bear upon forward looking statements. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Executive Summary We have been an education provider for more than 30 years, operating University of Phoenix, Inc. (UPX), Institute for Professional Development, Inc. (IPD), The College for Financial Planning Institutes Corporation (CFP), Western International University, Inc. (WIU) and Insight Schools, Inc. (Insight), all of which are our wholly owned subsidiaries. We offer innovative and distinctive educational programs and services from high school through college level at 102 campuses and 157 learning centers in 40 states and the District of Columbia; Puerto Rico; Alberta and British Columbia, Canada; Mexico; and The Netherlands; as well as online throughout the world. Our combined Degreed Enrollment for UPX, including Axia College, as of August 31, 2007 was approximately 313,700. In addition, students are enrolled in WIU, CFP and IPD Client Institutions, and additional non degreed students are enrolled in UPX. See Customers/Students in Item 1 of this Report. Degreed Enrollments represent individual students enrolled in our degree programs who attended a course during the quarter and did not graduate as of the end of the quarter (including Axia students enrolled in UPX and WIU). Degreed Enrollments include any student who graduated from one degree program and started a new degree program (for example, a graduate of the associates degree program returns for a bachelors degree or a graduate of a bachelors degree program returns for a masters degree), as well as students who have been out of attendance for greater than 12 months and return to a program. The non traditional education market is a significant and growing component of the post secondary education market, which is estimated by the U.S. Department of Education to be a more than $373.0 billion industry. According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, over 6.8 million, or 39%, of all students enrolled in higher education programs are over the age of 24. A large percentage of these students would not be classified as traditional (i.e., living on campus, supported by parents and not working). The non traditional students typically are looking to improve their skills and enhance their earnings potential within the context of their careers. Between 2002 and 2014, the percentage of 18 to 24 year old students in the U.S. is expected to increase 16%. The market for non traditional education should continue to increase, reflecting the rapidly expanding knowledge based economy. During fiscal year 2007, we experienced the following significant events: 1. Senior Management Changes Ms. Kenda B. Gonzales resigned as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Ms. Gonzales was replaced by Mr. Joseph L. DAmico who was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Daniel E. Bachus resigned as Chief Accounting Officer and Controller and was replaced by Mr. Brian L. Swartz, who was appointed Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Gregory W. Cappelli was appointed Executive Vice President, Global Strategy and Assistant to the Chairman. Additionally, subsequent to August 31, 2007, P. Robert Moya was appointed Senior Vice President and General Counsel. 2. Enrollment and Revenue Growth While Investing in our Business for the Future We achieved a 10.5% average quarterly Degreed Enrollment growth for the year ended August 31, 2007, which resulted in a 9.9% increase in revenue for the year ended August 31, 2007. These increases helped fund a significant portion of our investment in product development and marketing and lead generation over the same period to ensure our continued growth and viability in the future. 3. Financial Statement Restatement On May 22, 2007, we filed our 2006 Form 10 K and three Form 10 Q Reports with the SEC. With these filings, we have completed the process related to our financial statement restatement. On May 24, 2007, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council determined that we demonstrated compliance with all Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and informed us that the Nasdaq delisting matter is now closed and our Class A Common Stock will continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. On July 3, 2007, the SEC notified us that it had closed its inquiry into our stock option grants, without recommending any enforcement action. 46 Table of Contents 4. Naming Rights to Glendale, Arizona Sports Complex On September 22, 2006, we entered into an agreement with New Cardinals Stadium LLC, BB Holdings, Inc., an unrelated third party doing business as the Arizona Cardinals, for UPX naming rights on a stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which is home to the Arizona Cardinals National Football League football club. The naming rights include signage, advertising and other promotional benefits. The initial agreement term is 20 years with options to extend. Pursuant to the agreement, we were required to pay a total of $5.8 million for the 2006 contract year, which is increased 3% per year until 2026. Other payments apply if certain events occur, such as the Cardinals playing in the Super Bowl or if there are sold out home games. 5. Insight Schools Acquisition On October 20, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Insight. Insight operates an online high school and engages in the business of servicing cyber high schools and other online education. We acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Insight for $15.5 million. The purchase price included the payment of seller transaction fees, the repayment of certain existing indebtedness, payment of employee sale bonuses, and payments to option holders, warrant holders, and convertible note holders. This acquisition allows us to expand into the online charter high school market. As a result of the acquisition, goodwill increased by $12.7 million. 6. Aptimus, Inc. Acquisition On August 8, 2007, we announced our intention to acquire online advertising network Aptimus, Inc. (Nasdaq: APTM) for $6.25 per share in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $47.6 million. This acquisition will help us increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our online advertising directed at increasing awareness of and access to quality education services. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including Aptimus shareholder approval. The acquisition is expected to close in early fiscal 2008, after Aptimus shareholder meeting scheduled for October 29, 2007. 7. Apollo Global, Inc. On October 22, 2007, we formed a joint venture with The Carlyle Group (Carlyle), called Apollo Global, Inc. (Apollo Global) to pursue investments in the international education services sector. Carlyle, based in Washington D.C., is one of the worlds largest and most prestigious private equity firms, managing over $76 billion in assets for over 1,000 institutional investors, including several of the largest pension funds in the U.S. Through Apollo Global, we intend to capitalize on the high global demand for education services. Apollo Global will provide education services through two primary strategies. First, Apollo Global will continue to provide our wide range of U.S. accredited degrees to foreign students outside the U.S. Second, Apollo Global will provide local education services, including post secondary degrees, in the countries it seeks to enter. These capabilities will be achieved through both a disciplined acquisition process and organic growth. We have agreed that, within approximately 18 months, all of our education related activities directed toward students who live outside the U.S. and who are not citizens of the U.S. or members of the U.S. military will be conducted through Apollo Global. We have agreed to commit up to $801 million in cash or contributed assets and own 80.1% of Apollo Global. Carlyle has agreed to commit up to $199 million in cash or contributed assets and own the remaining 19.9%. Additionally, conservative amounts of debt will be employed, as appropriate. The Board of Apollo Global will consist of seven directors, four of whom will be designated by us and two of whom will be designated by Carlyle. The seventh director will be the President of Apollo Global. Additionally, 10 to 15% of the value of the equity will be available to provide incentives for management of Apollo Global. Apollo Global will be consolidated in our financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 47 Table of Contents the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We believe that our critical accounting policies, which involve a higher degree of judgments, estimates and complexity, are as follows: Revenue Recognition Tuition and other revenue, net consists largely of tuition and fees associated with different educational programs as well as related educational resources such as printed text books and access to online materials, and are shown net of discounts. The following table presents the most significant components as percentages of total tuition and other revenue, net for the years ended August 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Tuition revenue $ 2,553.1 94 % $ 2,304.3 93 % $ 2,114.1 94 % IPD services revenue 73.6 2 % 74.4 3 % 69.5 3 % Application and related fees 27.6 1 % 33.8 1 % 36.4 2 % Online course material revenue 161.0 6 % 138.7 6 % 104.5 5 % Other revenue 20.9 1 % 31.7 1 % 33.8 1 % Tuition and other revenue, gross 2,836.2 104 % 2,582.9 104 % 2,358.3 105 % Less: Discounts (112.4 ) (4 )% (105.4 ) (4 )% (107.2 ) (5 )% Tuition and other revenue, net $ 2,723.8 100 % $ 2,477.5 100 % $ 2,251.1 100 % Tuition revenue encompasses both online and classroom based learning. Tuition revenue is recognized pro rata, on a weekly basis, over the period of instruction as services are delivered to students. During certain periods of the year and in certain businesses, we adjust our revenue recognition to account for holiday breaks such as Christmas and Thanksgiving. IPD services revenue consist of the contractual share of tuition revenues from students enrolled in IPD programs at Client Institutions. IPD contracts with Client Institutions to provide services including, but not limited to, management consulting and training; program development; program administration; instructor and student recruiting; and student accounting, collection and recordkeeping. The contractual share varies by contract and may change over time. Our contractual share ranges between 30% and 50%. Contracts generally have terms of 10 years with provisions for renewal. The portion of service revenue to which we are entitled under the terms of the contracts is recognized on a pro rata basis as services are provided. Application and related fees consist of the fees students pay when submitting an enrollment application and the application costs related to the expenses associated with processing the applications. Both the fees and the costs are deferred and recognized over the average length of time it takes for a student to complete a program of study. Online course material revenue relates to online course materials delivered to students over the period of instruction. Revenue associated with these materials is recognized pro rata over the period of the related course to correspond with delivery of the materials to students. Other revenue is primarily composed of non tuition generating revenues, such as renting classroom space and other student support services. This revenue is recognized as these services are provided. Discounts include a variety of promotional programs including military discounts, special promotional incentives designed to generate new student enrollment, early payment discounts and other incentives. Goodwill Goodwill is primarily the result of our acquisitions of CFP and Insight. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) addresses goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and 48 Table of Contents prescribes that these assets will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if circumstances arise indicating potential impairment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit containing goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. This pronouncement provides specific guidance on performing impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires judgment. In assessing the fair value of our reporting units, we make estimates about the future cash flows of our reporting units. Our cash flow forecast is based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Other factors we consider include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the overall business strategy, and significant negative industry or economic trends. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record non cash impairment charges for these assets. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets for our reporting units. We have engaged a third party valuation expert to assist in evaluating the fair values of our reporting units. We have selected August 31 and May 31 as the dates on which we perform our annual goodwill impairment tests for CFP and Insight, respectively. Based on our goodwill impairment tests, no impairments in goodwill were recorded during 2007. Share Based Compensation Prior to September 1, 2005, we accounted for all employee and non employee director share based compensation awards using the intrinsic value method under APB 25, and provided the required disclosures in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). On September 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified prospective transition method. Under both APB 25 and SFAS 123(R), the requisite service period over which share based compensation is expensed generally equals the vesting periods of the awards. Under SFAS 123(R), our share based compensation is based on the fair value of the option at the grant date. The fair value is affected by the stock price, as well as the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model (the BSM) valuation assumptions, including the volatility of the stock price, expected term of the option, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. We use the BSM for estimating the fair value on the date of the grant of stock options. We used the following weighted average assumptions in the BSM: Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 2005 Expected volatility 32.7 % 34.6 % 30.2 % Expected life (years) 4.2 5.9 3.9 Risk free interest rate 4.9 % 4.8 % 3.4 % Dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % The assumptions that have the most significant affect on the fair value of the grants and therefore, share based compensation expense, are the expected life and expected volatility. The following table illustrates how changes to the BSM assumptions would affect the weighted average per option fair values as of the grant date for grants made during fiscal year 2007: Expected Volatility Expected Life (years) 29.4% 32.7% 35.9% 3.7 $ 16.39 $ 17.55 $ 18.70 4.2 17.64 18.84 20.04 4.7 18.83 20.07 21.30 We granted 5.5 million options during 2007, which excludes 1.6 million options that were canceled and regranted as part of our programs to cure 409A tax consequences for our current and former employees. 49 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our schools and programs, and based upon past experience and current trends, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables. Our allowance estimation methodology has been refined and considers a number of factors that, based on collections history, we believe have an impact on our ability to collect student receivables. We monitor our collections and write off experience and periodically determine whether adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary. As a result, we believe that our allowance estimation methodology reflects historical trends as well as our most recent collections experience and reasonably estimates future losses attributable to receivable write offs. Our standard allowance estimation methodology is periodically evaluated for sufficiency by management and modified as necessary. Changes to the design of our standard allowance estimation methodology, including our allowance percentage estimates, may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results. When a student with Title IV loans withdraws from UPX or WIU, we are sometimes required to return a portion of Title IV funds to the lenders. We are generally entitled to collect these funds from the students, but collection of these receivables is significantly lower than our collection of receivables from students who remain in our educational programs. Any change in the amount of Return to Lender or collection rates are factored into the determination of an appropriate allowance amount. A one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables as of August 31, 2007, would have resulted in a pre tax change in income of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax). Additionally, if our allowance for doubtful accounts were to change by 1% of tuition and other revenues, net for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, we would have recorded a pre tax change in income of approximately $27.2 million ($16.6 million after tax). Accounts receivable are written off when the account is deemed to be uncollectible. This typically occurs once we have exhausted all efforts to collect the account, which includes collection attempts by our employees and outside collection agencies. Insurance Reserves We record liabilities for claims and related expenses that are estimable and probable related to our self insured medical and dental insurance programs in accordance with the contractual terms of the insurance policies. Accounting for insurance liabilities that are self insured involves uncertainty because estimates and judgments are used to determine the ultimate liability for reported claims as well as claims incurred but not reported. We consider our historical experience in determining the appropriate insurance reserves. We record reserves for claims incurred but not recorded assuming a 45 day lag in the submission of claims. The following table displays the required increase or decrease to the insurance reserve if current claim lag time trends differed from our historical claim lag time experience: Pre Tax (Decrease) Claim Lag Time Increase ($ in millions) 30 days $ (3.0 ) 45 days 60 days 3.0 Loss Contingencies In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5), when we become aware of a claim or potential claim, the likelihood of any loss or exposure is assessed. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the loss. The liability recorded includes probable and estimable legal costs associated with the claim or potential claim. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is 50 Table of Contents reasonably possible and the amount is material. For matters where no loss contingency is recorded, our policy is to expense legal fees as incurred. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted laws and tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and, in particular, whether or not a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Certain tax deductions in prior years with respect to compensation attributable to the exercise of certain stock options by executive officers may be in question. Under IRC Section 162(m), the amount of such deduction per covered executive officer is limited to $1.0 million per year, except to the extent the compensation qualifies as performance based. Compensation attributable to options with revised measurement dates may not have qualified as performance based compensation. Accordingly, we may have claimed deductions with respect to those exercised options that were in excess of the limit imposed under IRC Section 162(m). As a result, we have accrued our best estimate, representing the high end of our estimated potential exposure, with respect to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties for the taxable years 2003 through 2007 (which are currently our only open years subject to adjustment for federal tax purposes) of approximately $44.6 million as of August 31, 2007. For prior periods where a liability existed and where the statute of limitations has expired, the accrual relating to that period has been reversed in the period in which the statute expired. Results of Operations We have included below a discussion of our operating results and significant items that explain the material changes in our operating results during the last three years. The following table sets forth an analysis of our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal years ended 2007, 2006, and 2005: % of Revenues % Change Year Ended August 31, Year Ended August 31, 2007 vs. 2006 vs. 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Revenues: Tuition and other, net $ 2,723.8 $ 2,477.5 $ 2,251.1 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 9.9 % 10.1 % Costs and expenses: Instructional costs and services 1,237.5 1,109.6 952.5 45.4 % 44.8 % 42.3 % 11.5 % 16.5 % Selling and promotional 659.1 544.7 485.5 24.2 % 22.0 % 21.6 % 21.0 % 12.2 % General and administrative 201.5 153.0 98.6 7.4 % 6.2 % 4.4 % 31.7 % 55.2 % Goodwill impairment 20.2 0.8 % Share based compensation(1) 16.9 0.7 % 2,098.1 1,827.5 1,553.5 77.0 % 73.8 % 69.0 % 14.8 % 17.6 % Income from operations 625.7 650.0 697.6 23.0 % 26.2 % 31.0 % (3.7 )% (6.8 )% Interest income and other, net 31.6 18.1 16.8 1.1 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 74.6 % 7.7 % Income before income taxes 657.3 668.1 714.4 24.1 % 26.9 % 31.7 % (1.6 )% (6.5 )% Provision for income taxes 248.5 253.3 286.5 9.1 % 10.2 % 12.7 % (1.9 )% (11.6 )% Net income $ 408.8 $ 414.8 $ 427.9 15.0 % 16.7 % 19.0 % (1.4 )% (3.1 )% (1) Related to the August 27, 2004, conversion of UPX Online common stock outstanding and stock options to Apollo Group Class A common stock outstanding and stock options. 51 Table of Contents We categorize our expenses as instructional costs and services, selling and promotional, and general and administrative. Instructional costs and services at UPX, WIU, CFP and Insight consist primarily of costs related to the delivery and administration of our educational programs and include faculty compensation, administrative compensation for departments that provide service directly to the students, financial aid processing costs, the costs of educational materials sold, facility leases and other occupancy costs, bad debt expense, technology spending in support of student systems and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment. UPX and WIU faculty members are primarily contracted for one course offering at a time. All classroom facilities are leased or, in some cases, are provided by the students employers at no charge to us. Instructional costs and services at IPD consist primarily of program administration, student services, and classroom lease expense. Most of the other instructional costs for IPD assisted programs, including faculty, financial aid processing, and other administrative salaries, are the responsibility of IPDs Client Institutions. Selling and promotional costs consist primarily of compensation for enrollment counselors, management and support staff, corporate marketing, advertising, production of marketing materials, and other costs related to selling and promotional functions. We expense selling and promotional costs as incurred. General and administrative costs consist primarily of administrative compensation, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and other related costs for departments such as executive management, information systems, corporate accounting, human resources, and other departments that do not provide direct services to our students. To the extent possible, we centralize these services to avoid duplication of effort. Tuition and Other Revenue, Net Information about our tuition and other revenue, net by reportable segment on a percentage basis is as follows: Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 2005 UPX 93.1 % 83.7 % 89.5 % Other Schools 6.8 % 16.2 % 10.4 % Corporate 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Tuition and other revenue, net 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Our tuition and other revenue, net increased by 9.9% in 2007 primarily due to a 10.5% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollments and selective tuition price increases depending on geographic area and program. Our associates degree program has a lower price point than our other programs. Accordingly, we continued to experience negative mix shift in 2007 compared to 2006 as our associates average quarterly Degreed Enrollments increased 55.0%, and represented 33.3% of our Degreed Enrollments at August 31, 2007 compared to 26.2% at August 31, 2006. The negative mix shift was slightly offset by an approximate 9% average tuition increase in our associates degree program in May 2007. We expect this tuition increase to positively impact our associates degree tuition rate per Degreed Enrollment prospectively. Our tuition and other revenues, net increased by 10.1% in 2006 primarily due to a 5.4% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollments and selective tuition price increases depending on geographic area and program. These increases include a 113.0% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollments in our lower tuition associates degree programs. As of August 31, 2006, 26.2% of our students are Degreed Enrollments in associates degree programs compared with 15.4% of our students as of August 31, 2005. Tuition and other revenue, net at Other Schools increased as a percentage of total revenues in 2006 and 2005 due to enrollment in associates degree programs at Axia College of WIU during 2005. Axia College began offering these programs in September 2004. In March 2006 (our third quarter of fiscal 2006), we began offering all Axia College programs within UPX, instead of WIU. As a result of enrolling students in Axia College within UPX, Other Schools revenue as a percentage of total revenues decreased in 2007 versus 2006. 52 Table of Contents Instructional Costs and Services Instructional costs and services increased by 11.5% in 2007 versus 2006, and 16.5% in 2006 versus 2005. The following table sets forth the increases in significant components of instructional costs and services: % of Revenues % Change Year Ended August 31, Year Ended August 31, 2007 vs. 2006 vs. 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Employee compensation and related expenses $ 424.4 $ 378.3 (1) $ 339.4 (1) 15.6 % 15.3 % 15.1 % 12.2 % 11.5 % Faculty compensation 236.9 212.3 195.1 8.7 % 8.6 % 8.7 % 11.6 % 8.8 % Classroom lease expenses and depreciation 205.2 194.3 (1) 171.7 (1) 7.5 % 7.8 % 7.6 % 5.6 % 13.2 % Other instructional costs and services 173.3 158.8 (1) 142.1 (1) 6.4 % 6.4 % 6.3 % 9.1 % 11.8 % Bad debt expense 120.6 101.0 (1) 57.1 (1) 4.4 % 4.1 % 2.5 % 19.4 % 76.9 % Financial aid processing costs 63.8 52.5 43.3 2.3 % 2.1 % 1.9 % 21.5 % 21.2 % Share based compensation 13.3 12.4 3.8 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.2 % 7.3 % 226.3 % Instructional costs and services $ 1,237.5 $ 1,109.6 $ 952.5 45.4 % 44.8 % 42.3 % 11.5 % 16.5 % (1) Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with 2007 presentation. Instructional costs and services as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net increased in 2007 versus 2006 due primarily to an increase in bad debt expense and higher employee compensation and related expenses. Bad debt expense increased as a result of higher DSOs (38 days as of August 31, 2007 compared to 31 days as of August 31, 2006), longer receivable collection periods, and higher write offs primarily from our associates degree program students. Employee compensation and related expenses increased primarily to support the 10.5% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollments. Instructional costs and services as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net increased in 2006 versus 2005 due primarily to an increase in bad debt expense. The increase is the result of increased aged accounts receivable and write offs as a result of increased student withdrawals and an increase in Return to Lender dollars for students who withdraw from UPX or WIU. When a student withdraws from UPX or WIU, we are sometimes required to return a certain portion of any disbursed student financial aid loans to the lender (Return to Lender dollars for Title IV recipients). We are generally entitled to collect these funds from the students, but collection on these receivables is significantly lower than receivables for students who remain in our educational programs. During the second half of our fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, we were required by regulatory authorities to modify our Return to Lender calculations when a student withdraws from UPX or WIU. These changes forced us to return additional dollars to the lenders than had previously been required. We attempt to collect these funds from our students but as a result of the increased Return to Lender dollars, our bad debt expense significantly increased in 2006. 53 Table of Contents Selling and Promotional Expenses Selling and promotional expenses increased by 21.0% in 2007 versus 2006, and 12.2% in 2006 versus 2005. The following table sets forth the increases in significant components of selling and promotional expenses: % of Revenues % Change Year Ended August 31, Year Ended August 31, 2007 vs. 2006 vs. 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Enrollment counselors compensation and related expenses $ 320.3 $ 254.3 $ 204.6 11.8 % 10.3 % 9.1 % 26.0 % 24.3 % Advertising 277.7 231.6 224.0 10.2 % 9.3 % 10.0 % 19.9 % 3.4 % Other selling and promotional expenses 58.0 56.5 56.2 2.1 % 2.3 % 2.5 % 2.7 % 0.5 % Share based compensation 3.1 2.3 0.6 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.0 % 34.8 % 283.3 % Selling and promotional expenses $ 659.1 $ 544.7 $ 485.4 24.2 % 22.0 % 21.6 % 21.0 % 12.2 % Selling and promotional expenses increased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 versus 2006 due primarily to an increase in the number of enrollment counselors to support leads for our Internet advertising campaign. During 2007, we experienced a slight increase in our cost per New Degreed Enrollment (or Starts) which is calculated by dividing total selling and promotional expenses by the amount of new Starts for the year. The hiring of an additional 600 enrollment counselors in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased our enrollment counseler compensation and related expenses. The productivity of these counselors improved during 2007, and as a result, we have experienced increased conversion rates. Also, in 2007 selling and promotional expenses increased as a result of our continued investment in Internet based advertising campaigns and the launch of our nationally televised branding campaign. Selling and promotional expenses increased as a percentage of revenue in 2006 versus 2005 due primarily to an increase in the number of enrollment advisors to support leads for our Internet advertising campaign and the establishment of a national qualifying center for efficiency and timelines in lead distribution. We also increased the entry level pay for enrollment advisors in an attempt to bring in more highly qualified staff. On August 8, 2007, we announced our intention to acquire online advertising network Aptimus, Inc. (Nasdaq: APTM) for $6.25 per share in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $47.6 million. This acquisition will serve to advance our continuing efforts to enhance the efficacy of our online advertising investments in support of our mission to increase awareness of and access to quality education services. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including Aptimus shareholder approval. The acquisition is expected to close in early fiscal 2008, after Aptimus shareholder meeting scheduled for October 29, 2007. 54 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 31.7% in 2007 versus 2006, and 55.2% in 2006 versus 2005.

This compares with 4.4% in 2005. The remaining increase in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily related to higher employee headcount to support our growth and higher share based compensation expense. The remaining increase in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to: $3.9 million increase in legal, audit, and corporate insurance expenses primarily due to legal defense costs associated with class action complaints; $9.6 million increase in share based compensation charges primarily resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123(R); $3.5 million of increased administrative space and depreciation costs due to higher information technology spending primarily as a result of the opening of a new data center in August 2005; and other increases including increased employee headcount to support our growth in 2006. Goodwill Impairment As of August 31, 2006, we concluded that the goodwill for our CFP business was impaired in the amount of $20.2 million. This impairment was included in our Other Schools segment. In performing our annual impairment test, we assessed the recoverability of the goodwill by evaluating the future discounted cash flows and the fair value of CFPs tangible and intangible assets. The total discounted future cash flows was determined to be significantly less than our original expectations due to slower than forecasted revenue growth. There are no other long lived assets at CFP that we believe are impaired. Share Based Compensation Conversion of UPX Stock Options The conversion of UPX Online common stock on August 27, 2004, required us to record a share based compensation charge related to the conversion of UPX Online stock options into Apollo Group Class A stock options. As required by Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Statement No. 00 23 Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44 (EITF 00 23), we recognized pre tax share based compensation expense of $16.9 million in 2005 as options vested. Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net increased $13.5 million in 2007 versus 2006, and $1.3 million in 2006 versus 2005. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to increases in average cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities balances and increases in average interest rates. The increase in 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates partially offset by a decrease in average cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate decreased from 37.9% in 2006 to 37.8% in 2007. This slight decrease was the result of an increase in tax exempt interest, partially offset by a reduction in the state income tax rate. The decrease from 40.1% in 2005 to 37.9% in 2006 is primarily a result of a reduction in non deductible compensation and state taxes, combined with an increase in tax exempt interest. Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Financial Position Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, commitments, acquisitions and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. We believe that the most strategic uses of our cash resources include potential acquisition opportunities including, over time our commitment to Apollo Global, possible repurchase of shares, and start up costs associated with new campuses. 56 Table of Contents Cash Flows Operating Activities. Operating activities provided $588.6 million in cash during 2007 compared to $551.0 million in 2006. Included below is a summary of our operating cash flows: Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Net income $ 408.8 $ 414.8 $ 427.9 Non cash items 196.0 180.0 174.0 Changes in certain operating assets and liabilities (16.2 ) (43.8 ) (52.3 ) Net cash from operating activities $ 588.6 $ 551.0 $ 549.6 The most significant item in these operating cash flow activities is our accounts receivable. We monitor our accounts receivable through a variety of metrics, including days sales outstanding (DSO). We calculate our DSO based on determining average daily revenue based on a rolling twelve month analysis and divide it into the gross student accounts receivable balance as of the end of the period. We previously reported that our DSO as of August 31, 2006 was 32 days. This was inaccurately reported due to a miscalculation; the correct DSO was 31 days. DSO has increased to 38 days as of August 31, 2007. The increase in DSO during 2007 is primarily the result of longer receivable collection periods and higher write offs primarily from our associates degree program students. Investing Activities. Investing activities used $131.9 million in cash during 2007, compared to providing $95.6 million in 2006. The 2007 amount primarily includes $104.6 million of capital expenditures, which includes $43.4 million related to the build out of our new corporate headquarters buildings in Phoenix, Arizona. This use of cash is partially offset by net maturities of marketable securities including auction rate securities of $46.0 million. The 2006 amount primarily includes net maturities of marketable securities including auction rate securities of $216.2 million, partially offset by $111.2 million of capital expenditures, including $66.6 million for our new corporate headquarters. We expect to spend $60.0 to $80.0 million on capital expenditures in 2008, of which approximately $5.0 to $15.0 million will be utilized for our new corporate headquarters buildings. On June 20, 2006, we entered into an option agreement (which was amended in November 2006) with Macquarie Riverpoint AZ, LLC (Macquarie). The option agreement allows us to execute a sale and simultaneous leaseback of the new corporate headquarters land and buildings located in Phoenix, Arizona. We anticipate beginning to occupy these buildings early in fiscal year 2008 and finishing construction by the end of the second quarter of 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, we anticipate executing the sale leaseback option. When the sale leaseback option is exercised, we anticipate receiving approximately $170 million in cash for the buildings and land, and expect to generate a gain on the sale of approximately $20 30 million. The gain will be deferred over the 12 year term of the lease agreement. Financing Activities. Financing activities used $426.0 million of cash during 2007 compared to $474.8 million in 2006. These amounts primarily relate to repurchases of our Class A common stock, net of proceeds from stock option exercises. The Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase outstanding shares of Apollo Group Class A common stock, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other considerations. 57 Table of Contents Shares of Apollo Group Class A common stock repurchased and reissued, and the related total cost, for the last two years is as follows: Maximum Average Value Total # of Price of Shares Shares Paid per Available for Repurchased Cost Share Repurchase (Numbers in millions, except per share amounts) Treasury stock as of August 31, 2005 8.8 $ 645.7 $ 73.23 $ 51.0 New authorizations 600.0 Shares repurchased 8.2 514.9 63.00 (514.9 ) Shares reissued (1.5 ) (106.6 ) 69.15 Treasury stock as of August 31, 2006 15.5 $ 1,054.0 $ 68.23 $ 136.1 New authorizations 363.9 Shares repurchased 7.2 437.7 61.08 (437.7 ) Shares reissued (0.5 ) (30.3 ) 67.31 Treasury stock as of August 31, 2007 22.2 $ 1,461.4 $ 65.94 $ 62.3 On October 5, 2007, the Board of Directors increased the authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of Apollo Group Class A common stock. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table lists our contractual cash obligations as of August 31, 2007: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total ($ in millions) Operating lease obligations $ 135.1 $ 235.6 $ 155.5 $ 80.0 $ 606.2 Stadium naming rights(1) 6.5 12.5 13.2 115.6 147.8 Capital lease obligations 0.6 0.9 0.1 1.6 Purchase and other long term obligations(2) 11.6 3.0 14.6 Total $ 153.8 $ 249.0 $ 168.8 $ 198.6 $ 770.2 (1) Amounts consist of an agreement for 20 year naming rights to the Glendale, Arizona Sports Complex. (2) Amounts primarily consist of purchase obligations for construction of buildings for future expansion and deferred compensation payments due to John G. Sperling, our Founder. We have no other material commercial commitments not included in the above table. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 of our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated by reference in this Part II, Item 7. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Impact of Inflation Inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations. 58 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of marketable securities includes numerous issuers, varying types of securities, and varying maturities. We intend to hold all securities, other than auction rate securities, to maturity. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, interest income earned on our portfolio of marketable securities would have decreased $4.0 to $5.0 million due to a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates. We manage this interest rate risk by monitoring market conditions and the value of these assets. We have no significant short term or long term debt; therefore, we do not face any other significant interest rate risk. Concentration of Credit Risk A substantial portion of credit extended to students is paid through the students participation in various federal financial aid programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as reauthorized (the Higher Education Act), which we refer to as Title IV programs. The following table summarizes our total revenues from Title IV programs for the fiscal years ended 2007, 2006, and 2005. 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Total Title IV funding received $ 1,765.6 $ 1,536.6 $ 1,345.4 Total tuition and other revenues, net 2,723.8 2,477.5 2,251.1 Total Title IV funding as a percentage of total revenue 64.8 % 62.0 % 59.8 % We extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students enrolled. Receivables are not collateralized; however, credit risk is reduced as the amounts owed by any individual student is small relative to the total tuition receivable and the customer base is geographically diverse. 59 Table of Contents
