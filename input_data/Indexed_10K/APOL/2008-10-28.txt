Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to help investors understand Apollo Group, Inc. (the Company, Apollo Group, Apollo, APOL, we, us, or our), our operations, and our present business environment. The MDA is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes (Notes). The following overview provides a summary of the sections included in our MDA: Executive Summary a general description of our business and the education industry, as well as key highlights of the current year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates a discussion of our significant accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. Results of Operations an analysis of our results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. We operate primarily in one business sector: education. Except to the extent that differences among our 54 Table of Contents reportable segments are material to an understanding of our business as a whole, we present the discussion in our MDA on a consolidated basis. Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Financial Position an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, commitments and contingencies, seasonality in the results of our operations, the impact of inflation, and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. Executive Summary Apollo Group, Inc. is one of the worlds largest private education providers and has been in the education business for more than 30 years. We offer innovative and distinctive educational programs and services at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels online and on campus through our wholly owned subsidiaries, The University of Phoenix, Inc. (University of Phoenix), Institute for Professional Development (IPD), The College for Financial Planning Institutes Corporation (CFP), Western International University, Inc. (Western International University), and Insight Schools, Inc. (Insight Schools), and through our 80.1% owned subsidiary, Apollo Global, Inc. (Apollo Global). We recently established a new Canadian institution, Meritus University (Meritus), which began operations in September 2008. Our Degreed Enrollment for the quarter ended August 31, 2008 was 362,100. Degreed Enrollment for a quarter represents individual students enrolled in a University of Phoenix degree program or Western International University associates degree program who attended a course during the quarter and did not graduate as of the end of the quarter. Degreed Enrollment for a quarter also includes any student who previously graduated from one degree program and started a new degree program in the quarter (for example, a graduate of the associates degree program returns for a bachelors degree or a bachelors degree graduate returns for a masters degree). In addition, Degreed Enrollment includes students participating in certificate programs of at least 18 credit hours in length with some course applicability into a related degree program. Our aggregate New Degreed Enrollment for the four quarters in fiscal year 2008 was 288,200. New Degreed Enrollment for a quarter represents any individual student enrolled in a University of Phoenix degree program or Western International University associates degree program who is a new student and started a course in the quarter, any individual student who previously graduated from one degree program and started a new degree program in the quarter (for example, a graduate of an associates degree program returns for a bachelors degree program, or a graduate of a bachelors degree program returns for a masters degree program), as well as any individual student who started a program in the quarter and had been out of attendance for greater than 12 months. In addition, New Degreed Enrollment includes students who in the quarter started participating in certificate programs of at least 18 credit hours in length with some course applicability into a related degree program. Students enrolled in or serviced by Apollo Global institutions, Insight Schools and Other Schools (Western International Universitys non associates degree programs, IPD, CFP and Meritus) are not included in Degreed Enrollment or New Degreed Enrollment. In April 2006, we began enrolling the majority of new students for our associates degree programs in University of Phoenix. From September 2004 through March 2006, we enrolled most new associates degree students in Western International University. Domestic Postsecondary Education The domestic non traditional education industry is a significant and growing component of the postsecondary education market, which was estimated to be a more than $373.0 billion industry in 2006, according to the Digest of Education Statistics published in 2007 by the U.S. Department of Educations National Center for Education Statistics. According to the same study, in 2005, over 6.8 million, or 39%, of all students enrolled in higher education programs were over the age of 24, and enrollment in degree granting institutions between 2006 and 2016 is expected to increase approximately 30% for students aged 25 to 34 and 7% for those 35 and over. These students would not be classified as traditional (i.e., living on campus, supported by parents and not working full time). The non traditional students typically are looking to improve their skills and enhance their earnings potential within the context of their careers. We believe that the demand for non traditional education will continue to increase, reflecting the rapidly expanding knowledge based economy in the U.S. 55 Table of Contents International Education There were approximately 132 million students enrolled in postsecondary education worldwide and global government education expenditures totaled the equivalent of $2.0 trillion in 2004, according to the Global Education Digest 2007 published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics. This does not include capital expenditures on private education, which are difficult to track, though acknowledged by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to be growing around the world. We believe that private education is playing a critical role in advancing development of education, specifically higher education and lifelong learning, in many countries around the world. While primary and secondary education outside the U.S. are still funded mainly through government expenditures, we believe that postsecondary education outside of the U.S. is experiencing governmental funding constraints that create opportunities for a broader private sector role. The International Finance Corporation of the World Bank reported in May 2008 that governments around the world are embracing private sector participation as a way to increase quality and efficiency. Domestic High School Education According to the Department of Educations National Center for Education Statistics, based on data from 2005, there are approximately 20 million high school age students in the U.S. Throughout the nation, nearly five million high school age children are not enrolled in school and the high school dropout rate averages 25.3% across the nation based on the average freshman graduation rate. These statistics are illustrative of the large number of high school age children facing different challenges and with different needs in todays environment. Many parents and educators are seeking alternatives to traditional classroom based education that can help improve academic achievement. Demand for these alternatives is evident in the growing number of choices available to parents and students. For example, charter schools emerged in 1992 to provide an alternative to traditional public schools. As of May 2008, over 1.2 million students attend over 4,300 charter schools in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. At the same time, acceptance of online learning initiatives has increased. Online schools can offer a comprehensive curriculum and flexible delivery model; therefore, we believe that a growing number of families will pursue online public schools as an attractive public school alternative. We believe there is a significant opportunity for a high quality, trusted, national education provider to serve online public schools. During fiscal year 2008, we experienced the following significant events: 1. Enrollment and Net Revenue Growth We achieved 12.1% growth in average quarterly Degreed Enrollment for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008 as compared to fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, which, coupled with selective tuition price increases, depending on geographic area and program, were the primary factors contributing to a 15.3% increase in net revenue over the same period. 2. Apollo Global On October 22, 2007, we formed a joint venture with Carlyle, called Apollo Global, Inc., to pursue investments in the international education services industry. Carlyle, based in Washington D.C., is one of the worlds largest private equity firms. Through Apollo Global, we intend to capitalize on the significant global demand for education services. We have agreed to commit up to $801 million in cash or contributed assets and own 80.1% of Apollo Global. Carlyle has agreed to commit up to $199 million in cash or contributed assets and own the remaining 19.9%. Apollo Global is consolidated in our financial statements. As of August 31, 2008, total cash contributions made to Apollo Global were $61.0 million, of which $48.9 million was funded by us. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2008, Apollo Global completed its first two acquisitions, Universidad de Artes, Ciencias y Comunicacin (UNIACC) and related entities on March 28, 2008, and Universidad Latinoamericana, S.C. (ULA) and its related entity on August 4, 2008. Apollo Global purchased 100% of UNIACC for cash, assumed debt, and a future payment based on a multiple of earnings. Apollo Global purchased a 65% ownership interest in ULA for cash and assumed debt. 56 Table of Contents Please refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Joint Venture, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion. 3. Aptimus On October 29, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding common stock of online advertising company Aptimus, Inc. Prior to the acquisition, Aptimus operated as a results based advertising company that distributed advertisements for direct marketing advertisers across a network of third party web sites. The acquisition enables us to more effectively monitor, manage and control our marketing investments and brands. We have integrated Aptimus as part of our corporate marketing function. Please refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Joint Venture, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion. 4. Securities Class Action In October 2004, three class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The District Court consolidated the three pending class action complaints under the caption In re Apollo Group, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. CV04 2147 PHX JAT and a consolidated class action complaint was filed on May 16, 2005 by the lead plaintiff. The consolidated complaint named us, Todd S. Nelson, Kenda B. Gonzales and Daniel E. Bachus as defendants. On March 1, 2007, by stipulation and order of the Court, Daniel E. Bachus was dismissed as a defendant from the case. Lead plaintiff represents a class of our shareholders who acquired their shares between February 27, 2004 and September 14, 2004. The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b 5 promulgated under the Act by us for defendants allegedly material false and misleading statements in connection with our failure to publicly disclose the contents of a preliminary Department of Education program review report. The case proceeded to trial on November 14, 2007. On January 16, 2008, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs awarding damages of up to $5.55 for each share of common stock in the class suit, plus pre judgment and post judgment interest. The class shares are those purchased after February 27, 2004 and still owned on September 14, 2004. The judgment was entered on January 30, 2008, subject to an automatic stay until February 13, 2008. On February 13, 2008, the District Court granted our motion to stay execution of the judgment pending resolution of our motions for post trial relief, which were also filed on February 13, 2008, provided that we post a bond in the amount of $95.0 million. On February 19, 2008, we posted the $95.0 million bond with the District Court. Oral arguments occurred on August 4, 2008 as part of our post trial motions, during which the District Court vacated the earlier judgment based on the jury verdict and entered judgment in favor of Apollo and the other defendants. The $95.0 million bond posted in February was subsequently released on August 11, 2008. Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 29, 2008. The plaintiffs brief is due on December 15, 2008, and the defendants brief is due on January 13, 2009. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we recorded a charge for estimated damages of $168.4 million as a result of the jury verdict awarded in favor of the plaintiffs. The original charge was recorded at the mid point of the range of $120.5 million to $216.4 million and was estimated for financial reporting purposes, using statistically valid models and a 60% confidence interval which included our estimate of damages based on the verdict, our estimate of potential amounts we expected to reimburse our insurance carriers, our estimate of future defense costs and legal and other professional fees incurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. At that time, we elected to record the mid point of the range because under statistically valid modeling techniques, the mid point of the range was a more likely estimate than other points in the range, and was the point at which there was an equal probability that the ultimate loss could be toward the lower end or the higher end of the range. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we reversed the original estimated charge and related pre and post judgment interest totaling $170.0 million because the District Court vacated the earlier judgment and entered judgment in favor of Apollo. Applying similar assumptions used to estimate the original charge, including if the plaintiffs were to prevail in a judgment on appeal, we currently estimate our range of loss for this matter to be between zero and $219.6 million, with the high end of the range including pre and post judgment interest through August 31, 2008. Damages, if any, will not be known until all court proceedings, including the plaintiffs appeal, have been completed. Based on 57 Table of Contents information available to us at present, our management does not expect a material adverse effect on our business to result from this action. 5. Bank Facility On January 4, 2008, we entered into a syndicated $500 million credit agreement (the Bank Facility). The Bank Facility is an unsecured revolving credit facility that will be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and stock buybacks. The Bank Facility has an expansion feature for an aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million. The term is five years and will expire on January 4, 2013. The Bank Facility provides a multi currency sub limit facility for borrowings in certain specified foreign currencies up to $300 million. The Bank Facility fees are determined based on a pricing grid that varies according to our leverage ratio. The facility fee ranges from 12.5 to 17.5 basis points and the incremental fees for borrowings under the facility range from LIBOR + 50.0 to 82.5 basis points. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Bank Facility as of August 31, 2008. 6. Meritus In May 2008, Meritus received approval from the New Brunswick Department of Post Secondary Education, Training and Labour to offer its first three programs, thereby establishing degree granting status in Canada. Meritus offers degree programs online to working professionals throughout Canada and abroad. Meritus began operations in September 2008. 7. University of Phoenix Operating Realignment During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we announced a management and reporting realignment within University of Phoenix. Historically, University of Phoenix on campus operations have been managed by region and then by campus within each region. The global online operation was managed centrally. This realignment takes our online operation and shifts reporting responsibility to our regional management. University of Phoenix will retain an independently operating online campus under this new reporting structure. We believe this realignment will allow us to promote the sharing of common goals and best practices while maximizing efficiencies, and most importantly help us remain student focused. 8. Changes in Management On June 24, 2008, Brian E. Mueller resigned from his position as President and Director. Also, on June 24, 2008, our Board of Directors appointed Joseph L. DAmico as interim President, in addition to serving as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. On October 10, 2008, the Board determined that Mr. DAmico would continue to serve as President and no longer would be deemed to be serving in an interim capacity. On July 7, 2008, our Board of Directors appointed Charles B. Edelstein as Chief Executive Officer and a Director, effective August 26, 2008. 9. Academic Summary In 2008, University of Phoenix published its first Academic Annual Report which contains a transparent look at a variety of ways in which University of Phoenix measures itself in relation to its mission and social agenda of access and inclusion. The report was created within the framework set forth in the report commissioned by U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings and issued in 2006, entitled A Test of Leadership: Charting the Future of U.S. Higher Education, focusing on access, accountability, quality, and affordability. The report is available on our University of Phoenix website at www.phoenix.edu. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments, estimates and complexity, and are as follows: Revenue Recognition Our educational programs, primarily comprised of University of Phoenix programs, range in length from one day seminars to degree programs lasting up to four years. Students in University of Phoenix degree programs 58 Table of Contents generally enroll in a program of study encompassing a series of five to nine week courses taken consecutively over the length of the program. Generally, students are billed on a course by course basis when the student first attends a session, resulting in the recording of a receivable from the student and deferred revenue in the amount of the billing. Students generally fund their education through grants and or loans under various Title IV programs, tuition assistance from their employers, or personal funds. Net revenue consists largely of tuition and fees associated with different educational programs as well as related educational resources such as access to online materials. Net revenue is shown net of discounts. Tuition benefits for our employees and their eligible dependants are included in net revenue and as a part of employee compensation and related expenses within instructional costs and services. Total employee tuition benefits were $77.9 million, $63.8 million and $52.9 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table presents the most significant components of net revenue, and each component as percentage of total net revenue, for the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended August 31, ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Tuition and educational services revenue $ 2,996.1 95 % $ 2,553.1 94 % $ 2,304.3 93 % Services revenue 77.7 3 % 73.6 2 % 74.4 3 % Online course material revenue 184.4 6 % 161.0 6 % 138.7 6 % Other revenue 43.9 1 % 48.5 2 % 65.5 2 % Gross Revenue 3,302.1 105 % 2,836.2 104 % 2,582.9 104 % Less: Discounts (161.2 ) (5 )% (112.4 ) (4 )% (105.4 ) (4 )% Net revenue $ 3,140.9 100 % $ 2,723.8 100 % $ 2,477.5 100 % Tuition and educational services revenue encompasses both online and classroom based learning. For our University of Phoenix and Western International University operations, tuition revenue is recognized pro rata, on a weekly basis, over the period of instruction as services are delivered to students. For our Apollo Global operations, tuition revenue is recognized over the length of the course, which is typically over a period of a semester. During certain periods of the year and in certain businesses, our revenue recognition considers holiday breaks such as Christmas and Thanksgiving. For Insight Schools, which has recently expanded its operations in fiscal year 2008, we generate the majority of our tuition and educational services revenue through long term contracts with various school districts or online charter schools that generally have terms that range from 5 to 10 years with provisions for renewal. The school districts and online charter schools are generally funded by state or local governments primarily on a per student basis. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis in the period earned over the length of the school year, which is generally from September through June. Services revenue consists principally of the contractual share of tuition revenue from students enrolled in IPD programs at private colleges and universities (Client Institutions). IPD provides program development, administration and management consulting services to Client Institutions to establish or expand their programs for working adults. These services typically include degree program design, curriculum development, market research, student recruitment, accounting, and administrative services. IPD, which provides these services in 21 states, typically is paid a portion of the tuition revenue generated from these programs. IPDs contracts with its Client Institutions generally range in length from five to ten years, with provisions for renewal. The portion of service revenue to which we are entitled under the terms of the contracts is recognized on a pro rata basis over the service period. Online course material revenue relates to online course materials delivered to students over the period of instruction. Revenue associated with these materials is recognized pro rata over the period of the related course to correspond with delivery of the materials to students. Other revenue consist of the fees students pay when submitting an enrollment application, which, along with the related application costs associated with processing the applications, are deferred and recognized over the 59 Table of Contents average length of time it takes for a student to complete a program of study. Other revenue also includes non tuition generating revenues, such as renting classroom space and other student support services. This revenue is recognized as the services are provided. Discounts reflect reductions in tuition or other revenue including military, corporate, and other employer discounts, grants, and promotions. Generally, net revenue varies from period to period based on several factors, including the aggregate number of students attending classes, the number of classes held during the period and the tuition price per credit hour. Net revenue excludes any applicable state and city sales taxes. Sales tax collected from students is excluded from net revenue. Collected but unremitted sales tax is included as a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not material to our consolidated financial statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. Estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection experience and current trends. In determining these amounts, we look at the historical write offs of our receivables. We monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether adjustments are necessary. When a student with Title IV loans withdraws from University of Phoenix or Western International University, we are sometimes required to return a portion of Title IV funds to the lenders. We are generally entitled to collect these funds from the students, but collection of these receivables is significantly lower than our collection of receivables for students who remain in our educational programs. Management periodically evaluates the standard allowance estimation methodology for appropriateness and modifies as necessary. In doing so, we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the most recent collections experience and is responsive to changes in trends. Our accounts receivable are written off once the account is deemed to be uncollectible. This typically occurs once we have exhausted all efforts to collect the account, which include collection attempts by our employees and outside collection agencies. For the purpose of sensitivity, a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables as of August 31, 2008 would have resulted in a pre tax change in income of $2.8 million. Additionally, if our bad debt expense were to change by one percentage point of total net revenue for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008, we would have recorded a pre tax change in income of approximately $31.4 million. Marketable Securities Marketable securities consist primarily of auction rate securities, municipal bonds, U.S. government sponsored enterprises, and corporate obligations. We account for marketable securities in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). Auction rate securities are investments with interest rates that reset periodically through an auction process. Auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value, which had historically been consistent with amortized cost or par value due to interest rates which reset periodically, typically between 7 and 35 days. However, due to recent credit market tightening conditions, auction rate securities began experiencing failed auctions in mid February 2008 resulting in a lack of liquidity for these instruments that has reduced the estimated fair market value for these securities below par value. Please refer to Note 4, Marketable Securities, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion. Those marketable securities, which we have the ability and intent to hold until maturity, are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost. Marketable securities with a maturity date greater than one year and our auction rate securities instruments, due to the lack of liquidity, are classified as non current. Interest and dividend income, including the amortization of any premium or discount, is included in interest income and other, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As of August 31, 2008, our marketable securities totaled $28.3 million primarily consisting of $26.8 million of principal invested in auction rate securities. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we completed a fair value analysis of our auction rate securities in response to the prolonged and continued lack of liquidity for these 60 Table of Contents investments. Based on our analysis, we determined that our auction rate securities carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded an unrealized loss of $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax) on our auction rate securities, with the offset included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determined the fair market value of our auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model that encompassed unobservable inputs including probabilities of default and timing of auction failure, probabilities of a successful auction at par and or repurchase at par value for each auction period, collateralization of the underlying security and credit worthiness of the issuer. Additionally, as the market for these securities continues to be inactive and the secondary market remains in developmental stages, our discounted cash flow model also factored the illiquidity of the auction rate securities market by adding a spread of 450 basis points to the applicable discount rate. An increase of 100 basis points in our discount rate assumption would have caused an additional decline in the fair market value of approximately $0.4 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the amount assigned to the net assets acquired and assumed liabilities. Our goodwill is a result of our acquisitions of Aptimus, included in our University of Phoenix segment, UNIACC and ULA, included in our Apollo Global segment, Insight Schools, its own segment, and Western International University and CFP, included in our Other Schools segment. Indefinite lived intangible assets are recorded at fair market value on their acquisition date and primarily include foreign regulatory accreditations, designations and trademarks as a result of the UNIACC and ULA acquisitions. We assign indefinite lives to acquired trademarks, accreditations and designations that we believe have the continued ability to generate cash flows indefinitely; have no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic or other factors limiting the useful life of the respective intangible asset; and when we intend to renew the respective trademark, accreditation or designation and renewal can be accomplished at little cost. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least annually, unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the respective asset below its carrying amount. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests, if applicable, as of August 31 for CFP and May 31 for University of Phoenix, UNIACC and ULA, Insight Schools and Western International University. Finite lived intangible assets that are acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair market value on their acquisition date and are amortized on either a straight line basis or using an accelerated method to reflect the economic useful life of the asset. The weighted average useful lives range from two to 15 years. At August 31, 2008 and 2007, we had total goodwill of $86.0 million and $29.6 million, respectively, and intangible assets of $23.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Asset Impairments Marketable Securities Our marketable securities consist of available for sale securities, specifically auction rate securities instruments, and held to maturity securities. We regularly review these securities for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which the carrying value exceeds fair market value. For our auction rate securities instruments, we use a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair market value of the instruments. For our held to maturity securities, which include municipal bonds, we use broker pricing services to determine the fair market value of the instruments. As of August 31, 2008, our held to maturity securities are not material to our Consolidated Balance Sheets and all held to maturity instruments outstanding as of August 31, 2007 either matured or were called at par value during fiscal year 2008. For all of our marketable securities, we consider several factors to determine if an other than temporary decline has occurred such as the market value of each individual security in relation to its cost basis, the financial condition of the investee, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period to allow for the recovery in any market value of the investment. Temporary declines in fair market value for our available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other than temporary declines in fair market value for our available for sale and held to maturity securities are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 61 Table of Contents Long Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), we evaluate the carrying amount of our major long lived assets, including property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets, whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. At August 31, 2008, we believe the carrying amounts of our long lived assets are fully recoverable and no impairment exists. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), which requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of its net assets. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then a second step must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. In assessing the fair value of our reporting units, we rely primarily on using a discounted cash flow analysis which includes our estimates about the future cash flows of our reporting units that are based on assumptions consistent with our plans to manage the underlying businesses. Our analysis may also include using market based approach valuation techniques. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value analysis, when appropriate, we evaluate our results against other measurement indicators such as comparable company public trading values, analyst estimates and values observed in private market transactions. At the time of an acquisition, we allocate the goodwill and related assets to our respective reporting units. Please refer to Note 18, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion. The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. To determine the fair value of these intangible assets, we use various valuation models, such as discounted cash flow analysis or the relief from royalty method. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the respective asset below its carrying amount. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies which are in the scope of ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business, including those related to regulation, litigation, business transactions, employee related matters and taxes, among others. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5), when we become aware of a claim or potential claim, the likelihood of any loss or exposure is assessed. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the loss. The liability recorded includes probable and estimable legal costs incurred to date and future legal costs to the point in the legal matter where we believe a conclusion to the matter will be reached. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount of the potential loss is material. For matters where no loss contingency is recorded, our policy is to expense legal fees as incurred. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes pursuant to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. 62 Table of Contents On September 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB No. 109 (FIN 48). This interpretation, among other things, prescribes a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained. FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions, and it has expanded disclosure requirements. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we did not recognize an adjustment to our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits or make a cumulative adjustment to our beginning retained earnings; however, we reclassified our unrecognized tax benefits from income taxes payable to long term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Share Based Compensation On September 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment (SAB 107), relating to SFAS 123(R), which we applied in our adoption of SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards issued to employees and directors, based on estimated fair values of the share award on the date of grant. We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all share based awards granted after September 1, 2005 and for all unvested stock options outstanding as of September 1, 2005. For all unvested options outstanding as of September 1, 2005, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense, based on the fair value as determined under the provisions of SFAS 123, will be recognized as share based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining vesting period. For share based awards granted subsequent to September 1, 2005, compensation expense is based on the fair value as determined under the provisions of SFAS 123(R) and will be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period. Under the modified prospective transition method, prior periods are not restated for the effect of SFAS 123(R). In December 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, Share Based Payment (SAB 110). SAB 110 allows companies to continue to use the simplified method, as defined in SAB 107 to estimate the expected term of stock options under certain circumstances. The simplified method for estimating expected term is to use the mid point between the vesting term and the contractual term of the share option. We have analyzed the circumstances in which the use of the simplified method is allowed. We have opted to use the simplified method for options granted to management in fiscal year 2008 because the options granted in prior fiscal years had different terms, such as contractual lives and acceleration provisions. Thus, historical data is not comparable in order to determine the expected term of current awards. SFAS 123(R) requires us to calculate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant. We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to estimate fair value. The Black Scholes Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life, volatility, risk free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share based awards, based on both historical information and management judgment regarding market factors and trends. We amortize the share based compensation expense over the period that the awards are expected to vest, net of estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from management estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense are recorded. 63 Table of Contents We used the following weighted average assumptions in the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model: Year Ended August 31, 2008 2007 2006 Expected volatility 44.2 % 32.7 % 34.6 % Expected life (years) 4.2 4.2 5.9 Risk free interest rate 2.9 % 4.9 % 4.8 % Dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % The assumptions that have the most significant affect on the fair value of the grants and therefore, share based compensation expense, are the expected life and expected volatility. The following table illustrates how changes to the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model assumptions would affect the weighted average per option fair values as of the grant date for grants made during fiscal year 2008: Expected Volatility Expected Life (Years) 39.8% 44.2% 48.6% 3.7 $ 20.68 $ 22.48 $ 24.26 4.2 22.07 23.95 25.80 4.7 23.37 25.32 27.24 Results of Operations We have included below a discussion of our operating results and significant items that explain the material changes in our operating results during the last three fiscal years ending August 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The following table sets forth an analysis of our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006: % of Net Revenue % Change Year Ended August 31, Year Ended August 31, 2008 vs. 2007 vs. ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 Net revenue $ 3,140.9 $ 2,723.8 $ 2,477.5 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 15.3 % 9.9 % Costs and expenses: Instructional costs and services 1,370.9 1,237.5 1,109.6 43.6 % 45.4 % 44.8 % 10.8 % 11.5 % Selling and promotional 805.4 659.1 544.7 25.6 % 24.2 % 22.0 % 22.2 % 21.0 % General and administrative 215.2 201.5 153.0 6.9 % 7.4 % 6.2 % 6.8 % 31.7 % Goodwill impairment 20.2 0.8 % 0.0 % (100.0 )% Total costs and expenses 2,391.5 2,098.1 1,827.5 76.1 % 77.0 % 73.8 % 14.0 % 14.8 % Income from operations 749.4 625.7 650.0 23.9 % 23.0 % 26.2 % 19.8 % (3.7 )% Interest income and other, net 33.4 31.6 18.1 1.1 % 1.1 % 0.7 % 5.7 % 74.6 % Income before income taxes and minority interest 782.8 657.3 668.1 25.0 % 24.1 % 26.9 % 19.1 % (1.6 )% Provision for income taxes (306.9 ) (248.5 ) (253.3 ) (9.8 )% (9.1 )% (10.2 )% 23.5 % (1.9 )% Minority interest, net of tax 0.6 100.0 % 0.0 % Net income $ 476.5 $ 408.8 $ 414.8 15.2 % 15.0 % 16.7 % 16.6 % (1.4 )% We categorize our expenses as instructional costs and services, selling and promotional, and general and administrative. Instructional costs and services at University of Phoenix, Apollo Global, Insight Schools, and Other Schools consist primarily of costs related to the delivery and administration of our educational programs and include faculty compensation (full time and contract), administrative compensation for departments that provide service directly and indirectly to the students, financial aid processing costs, costs for collections efforts, bad debt expense and costs 64 Table of Contents of educational materials sold. Additionally, instructional costs include those costs such as rents and other occupancy costs, IT costs in support of student systems, and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment that support both the recruitment and retention of our students. Classroom facilities are primarily leased or, in some cases, are provided by the students employers at no charge to us. Instructional costs and services at IPD (included in Other Schools) consist primarily of program administration, student services, and classroom lease expense. Most of the other instructional costs for IPD assisted programs, including faculty, financial aid processing, and other administrative salaries, are the responsibility of IPDs Client Institutions. Tuition costs for all employees and their eligible dependants are recorded as a fringe benefit within instructional costs and services. Selling and promotional costs consist primarily of compensation for enrollment counselors, management and support staff and corporate marketing, advertising expenses, production of marketing materials, and other costs directly related to selling and promotional functions. Selling and promotional costs are expensed as incurred. General and administrative costs consist primarily of corporate compensation, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, legal and professional fees, and other related costs for departments such as executive management, information systems infrastructure, corporate accounting and finance, corporate human resources, and other departments that perform functions unrelated to the core business of recruiting and servicing our students. Net Revenue The following table presents net revenue by reportable segment, and net revenue for each reportable segment as percentage of total net revenue, for the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006: % of Net Revenue Year Ended August 31, Year Ended August 31, ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 University of Phoenix $ 2,987.7 $ 2,537.8 $ 2,074.4 95.2 % 93.1 % 83.7 % Apollo Global 13.4 0.4 % Insight Schools 7.5 2.0 0.2 % 0.1 % Other Schools 122.5 182.6 402.1 3.9 % 6.7 % 16.2 % Corporate 9.8 1.4 1.0 0.3 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Net revenue $ 3,140.9 $ 2,723.8 $ 2,477.5 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Fiscal Year 2008 compared to Fiscal Year 2007 Our net revenue increased 15.3%, primarily in our University of Phoenix segment, due to our 12.1% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollment and selective tuition price increases, depending on geographic area and program, which were partially offset by a continued shift in our student body mix to a higher percentage of students attending associates degree programs with lower tuition prices and an increase in scholarship and grant programs. The primary tuition price increase by program type was in our associates degree programs. In May 2007, we increased our associates degree tuition price by approximately 9%. Notwithstanding this tuition price increase, our associates degree programs have a lower tuition price than our other programs. We continued to experience a shift in our student body mix as our associates Degreed Enrollment represented 40.5% of our Degreed Enrollment at August 31, 2008, compared to 33.3% at August 31, 2007. In addition, our associates average quarterly Degreed Enrollment increased 37.9% in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007. Effective March 1, 2008, University of Phoenix changed its refund policy whereby students who attend 60% or less of a course are eligible for a refund for the portion of the course they did not attend. Under our prior refund policy, if a student attended one class of a course, University of Phoenix earned 25% of the tuition for the course, and if they attended two classes of a course, University of Phoenix earned 100% of the tuition for the course. This new refund policy applies to students in most states, as some states have their own mandated policies. University of Phoenix elected to change its refund policy because we believe it is a more reasonable policy from our students perspective. 65 Table of Contents In July 2008, University of Phoenix increased tuition approximately 10% for its associates degree programs and implemented selective tuition increases averaging 4% to 5%, depending on geographic area and program, for bachelors and masters degree programs. The impact of these price changes on future net revenue and operating income will depend on several factors including, but not limited to, changes in enrollment, changes in student mix within programs and degree levels, and discounts. Net revenue increased in our Apollo Global segment due to acquisitions. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Joint Venture, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion. Net revenue increased in our Insight Schools segment as a result of fiscal year 2008 including a full year of operating results following the acquisition of Insight Schools and an increase in the number of schools we were operating. Net revenue decreased in our Other Schools segment both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net revenue due to Western International University associates degree program students graduating or withdrawing from the program. We began offering associates degree programs at Western International University in September 2004; however, in April 2006 (our third quarter of fiscal year 2006) we began offering the majority of new enrollments in our associates degree programs at University of Phoenix instead of Western International University. Net revenue in Corporate increased as a result of our acquisition of Aptimus, which is discussed in Note 3, Acquisitions and Joint Venture, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We successfully integrated Aptimus into our marketing organization in fiscal year 2008. Upon acquisition and subsequent integration, a portion of our corporate marketing function generates revenue from Internet based advertising activities performed for third party customers. Fiscal Year 2007 compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Our net revenue increased by 9.9% primarily due to our 10.5% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollment and selective tuition price increases, depending on geographic area and program, which were partially offset by a continued shift in our student body mix to a higher percentage of students attending associate degree programs with lower tuition prices. The primary tuition price increase by program type was in our associates degree programs. In May 2007, we increased our associates degree tuition price by approximately 9%. Notwithstanding this tuition price increase, our associates degree programs have a lower tuition price than our other programs. Accordingly, we continued to experience a shift in our student body mix as our associates Degreed Enrollment represented 33.3% of our Degreed Enrollment at August 31, 2007 compared to 26.2% at August 31, 2006. In addition, our associates average quarterly Degreed Enrollment increased 55.0% in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006. Net revenue increased in our Insight Schools segment as result of our acquisition of Insight Schools in October 2006. Net revenue at our Other Schools segment decreased both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net revenue due to Western International University associates degree program students graduating or withdrawing from the program. We began offering associates degree programs at Western International University in September 2004; however, in April 2006 (our third quarter of fiscal year 2006) we began offering the majority of new enrollments in our associates degree programs at University of Phoenix instead of Western International University. 66 Table of Contents Instructional Costs and Services Instructional costs and services increased by 10.8% in fiscal year 2008 versus fiscal year 2007, and 11.5% in fiscal year 2007 versus fiscal year 2006. The following table sets forth the significant components of instructional costs and services: % of Net Revenue % Change Year Ended August 31, Year Ended August 31, 2008 vs. 2007 vs. ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 Employee compensation and related expenses $ 491.1 $ 424.4 $ 378.3 15.6 % 15.6 % 15.3 % 15.7 % 12.2 % Faculty compensation 272.5 236.9 212.3 8.7 % 8.7 % 8.6 % 15.0 % 11.6 % Classroom lease expenses and depreciation 214.2 205.2 194.3 6.8 % 7.5 % 7.8 % 4.4 % 5.6 % Other instructional costs and services 189.9 173.3 158.8 6.0 % 6.4 % 6.4 % 9.6 % 9.1 % Bad debt expense 104.2 120.6 101.0 3.3 % 4.4 % 4.1 % (13.6 )% 19.4 % Financial aid processing costs 78.4 63.8 52.5 2.5 % 2.3 % 2.1 % 22.9 % 21.5 % Share based compensation 20.6 13.3 12.4 0.7 % 0.5 % 0.5 % 54.9 % 7.3 % Instructional costs and services $ 1,370.9 $ 1,237.5 $ 1,109.6 43.6 % 45.4 % 44.8 % 10.8 % 11.5 % Fiscal Year 2008 compared to Fiscal Year 2007 Instructional costs and services decreased 180 basis points as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to decreases as a percentage of net revenue in classroom lease expenses and depreciation, other instructional costs and services and bad debt expense. Classroom lease expenses and depreciation decreased 70 basis points as a percentage of net revenue due to a larger percentage of our student body choosing to enroll in our online modality. Other instructional costs and services decreased 40 basis points as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to lower negotiated contract costs from third party vendors. Bad debt expense decreased 110 basis points as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to a continued focus on front end collection efforts and improved student retention rates. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we performed a review of the components of bad debt expense and identified certain items that should have been classified as discounts or refunds (reduction of net revenue) as opposed to bad debt expense. No reclassification was made for prior periods as the amounts were not material to prior period financial statements and had no effect on reported net income. For the fiscal year 2007, our reported bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenue would have been lower by approximately 70 basis points as a result of this reclassification. Excluding the reclassification discussed above, we experienced a decrease in bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenue of 40 basis points. During fiscal year 2008, we renegotiated our contract with our outsourced financial aid processing vendor. We expect these costs as a percentage of revenue to decrease beginning in fiscal 2009. Fiscal Year 2007 compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Instructional costs and services increased 60 basis points as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to higher employee compensation and related expenses and an increase in bad debt expense. Employee compensation and related expenses increased 30 basis points primarily to support the 10.5% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollments. 67 Table of Contents Bad debt expense increased 30 basis points as a result of higher days sales outstanding (38 days as of August 31, 2007 compared to 31 days as of August 31, 2006), longer receivable collection periods, and higher write offs primarily from our associates degree program students. Selling and Promotional Expenses Selling and promotional expenses increased by 22.2% in fiscal year 2008 versus fiscal year 2007, and 21.0% in fiscal year 2007 versus fiscal year 2006. The following table sets forth the increases in significant components of selling and promotional expenses: % of Net Revenue % Change Year Ended August 31, Year Ended August 31, 2008 vs. 2007 vs. ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 Enrollment counselors compensation and related expenses $ 385.8 $ 320.3 $ 254.3 12.3 % 11.8 % 10.3 % 20.4 % 26.0 % Advertising 322.5 277.7 231.6 10.3 % 10.2 % 9.3 % 16.1 % 19.9 % Other selling and promotional expenses 93.5 58.0 56.5 2.9 % 2.1 % 2.3 % 61.2 % 2.7 % Share based compensation 3.6 3.1 2.3 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % 16.1 % 34.8 % Selling and promotional $ 805.4 $ 659.1 $ 544.7 25.6 % 24.2 % 22.0 % 22.2 % 21.0 % Fiscal Year 2008 compared to Fiscal Year 2007 Selling and promotional expenses increased 140 basis points as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to an increase as a percentage of net revenue in enrollment counselors compensation and related expenses and other selling and promotional expenses. Enrollment counselors compensation and related expenses increased 50 basis points as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to the hiring of additional enrollment counselors to support our growth during fiscal year 2008. Other selling and promotional expenses increased 80 basis points as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to the acquisition of Aptimus that closed on October 29, 2007. We believe this acquisition, as discussed in Note 3, Acquisitions and Joint Venture, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, will help us increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and branding efforts. The overall increase in total selling and promotional expenses represents investments made to drive and support future growth of New Degreed Enrollment. In order to support future growth, we hired additional enrollment counselors in markets and segments where there is strong demand. We believe these additional hires are an investment in growing New Degreed Enrollment over time. Selling and promotional expenses per New Degreed Enrollment has increased as a result of a decrease in enrollment counselor effectiveness due to newly hired enrollment counselors. This trend of decreased effectiveness may continue; however, we believe our efforts and investments will help us reduce these costs as a percent of net revenue over the long term (we are seeing some improvement in enrollment counselor turnover). Fiscal Year 2007 compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Selling and promotional expenses increased 220 basis points as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to an increase as a percentage of net revenue in enrollment counselors compensation and related expenses and advertising expenses. Enrollment counselors compensation and related expenses increased 150 basis point as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to the hiring of additional enrollment counselors. 68 Table of Contents Advertising costs increased 90 basis points as a percentage of net revenue as a result of our continued investment in Internet based advertising campaigns and the launch of our nationally televised branding campaign. We experienced a slight increase in our cost per New Degreed Enrollment. The hiring of additional enrollment counselors in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 increased our enrollment counselor compensation and related expenses during fiscal year 2007. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 6.8% in fiscal year 2008 versus fiscal year 2007, and 31.7% in fiscal year 2007 versus fiscal year 2006. The following table sets forth the increases in significant components of general and administrative expenses: % of Net Revenue % Change Year Ended August 31, Year Ended August 31, 2008 vs. 2007 vs. ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 Employee compensation and related expenses $ 93.8 $ 71.9 $ 77.7 3.0 % 2.6 % 3.1 % 30.5 % (7.5 )% Share based compensation 29.4 37.6 13.0 0.9 % 1.4 % 0.5 % (21.8 )% 189.2 % Legal, audit, and corporate insurance 25.8 15.5 13.3 0.8 % 0.6 % 0.6 % 66.5 % 16.5 % Administrative space and depreciation 24.8 21.1 21.8 0.8 % 0.8 % 0.9 % 17.5 % (3.2 )% Other general and administrative expenses 41.4 55.4 27.2 1.4 % 2.0 % 1.1 % (25.3 )% 103.7 % General and administrative $ 215.2 $ 201.5 $ 153.0 6.9 % 7.4 % 6.2 % 6.8 % 31.7 % The items detailed below are included in the above table and are unusual in nature. We did not have any such unusual items during fiscal year 2008.

This increase as a percentage of net revenue is primarily due to: salary and related payroll costs due to the hiring of additional employees in our information technology, corporate development, legal, and finance functions to support our strategic growth initiatives and enhance corporate governance; increased legal costs in connection with defending ourselves in the legal matters described elsewhere in this report; and increased other general and administrative expenses to support our strategic growth initiatives. Fiscal Year 2007 compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Excluding the unusual items above, general and administrative expense increased 110 basis points as a percentage of net revenue. This increase as a percentage of net revenue is primarily due to higher employee headcount to support our growth and higher share based compensation expense from additional stock option grants. Goodwill Impairment As of August 31, 2006, we concluded that the goodwill for our CFP reporting unit was impaired in the amount of $20.2 million. This impairment was included in our Other Schools segment. In performing our annual impairment test, we assessed the recoverability of the goodwill by evaluating the future discounted cash flows and the fair value of CFPs tangible and intangible assets. The total discounted future cash flows was determined to be significantly less than our original expectations due to slower than forecasted net revenue growth. There are no other long lived assets at CFP that we believe are impaired. 70 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net The following table sets forth the changes in the significant components of interest income and other, net: Year Ended August 31, ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 30.1 $ 31.2 $ 18.5 Interest expense (3.5 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Other income (expense), net 9.6 0.6 (0.1 ) Foreign currency transaction loss, net (2.8 ) Interest income and other, net $ 33.4 $ 31.6 $ 18.1 Fiscal Year 2008 compared to Fiscal Year 2007 Interest income and other, net increased by $1.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to other income of $9.5 million in fiscal year 2008 from the forfeiture of the escrow deposit (including interest) by Macquarie as discussed in Note 7, Property and Equipment, net, of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, primarily offset by: $2.8 million in net foreign currency losses related to our international operations; $3.5 million of interest expense on borrowings under our Bank Facility, capital lease obligations and Credit Facilities at UNIACC and ULA; and $1.1 million decrease in interest income due to lower average balances and lower yields on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Fiscal Year 2007 compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Interest income and other, net increased by $13.5 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average cash balances and higher yields on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2008 compared to Fiscal Year 2007 Our effective income tax rate increased to 39.2% in fiscal year 2008, compared to 37.8% in fiscal year 2007. This increase was the result of a decrease in tax exempt interest and an increase in non deductible foreign losses. Fiscal Year 2007 compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Our effective income tax rate remained essentially the same at 37.8% in fiscal year 2007, compared to 37.9% in fiscal year 2006. Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Financial Position Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, cash generated from operations, available borrowings under our Bank Facility and our capacity for additional borrowings will be adequate to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, marketing and advertising program expenditures, share repurchases, interest and principal payments under our Bank Facility, other credit facilities and capital lease obligations, commitments, acquisitions, discretionary investments under our investment policy and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. We believe that the most strategic uses of our cash resources include potential acquisition opportunities, including our commitment to Apollo Global, possible share 71 Table of Contents repurchases, investments in the continued enhancement and expansion of our student offerings, and investments in marketing initiatives. However, in light of the current volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, there is no assurance that we could obtain additional financing beyond our current credit facility on terms acceptable to us, or at all, before the capital markets stabilize. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased $118.8 million, or 30.2%, to $511.5 million as of August 31, 2008, from $392.7 million as of August 31, 2007. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities represented 27.5% and 27.1% of our total assets as of August 31, 2008 and August 31, 2007, respectively. The increase was primarily due to $726.0 million of cash generated from operations and $103.0 million from stock option exercises, which was partially offset by $454.4 million used for the repurchase of 9.8 million shares of our Class A common stock, $104.9 million used for capital expenditures (including $12.4 million for our new corporate headquarters), and $93.8 million used for acquisitions, including Aptimus and Apollo Globals purchases of UNIACC and ULA. We have a long history of investing excess cash under a conservative corporate policy that only allows investments in highly rated securities, with preservation of capital and liquidity as the primary objectives. Our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer. We have historically invested a portion of our unrestricted investment portfolio in high quality (A rated and above) tax exempt municipal securities, preferred stock and other auction rate securities. Auction rate securities have historically traded on a shorter term than the underlying debt based on an auction bid that resets the interest rate of the security. The auction or reset dates occur at intervals established at the time of issuance that are generally between 7 and 35 days. Auction rate securities fail when there are not enough buyers to absorb the amount of securities available for sale for that particular auction period. Historically, auction rate securities auctions have rarely failed since the investment banks and broker dealers have been willing to purchase the security when investor demand was weak. However, beginning in mid February 2008, due to uncertainty in the global credit and capital markets and other factors, investment banks and broker dealers have been less willing to support auction rate securities and many auction rate securities auctions have failed. As of August 31, 2008, we had $26.8 million of principal invested in auction rate securities that experienced failed auctions. Approximately $16.8 million of our auction rate securities are invested in tax exempt municipal bond funds, which carry AA credit ratings for the underlying issuer and at least an A credit rating for the insurers. The remaining $10.0 million are invested in securities collateralized by student loans, which are rated AAA and are guaranteed by the U.S. government. None of the auction rate securities held by us are mortgage backed securities. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we completed a fair value analysis of our auction rate securities in response to the prolonged and continued lack of liquidity for these investments. At August 31, 2008, we used a discounted cash flow model that encompassed unobservable inputs including probabilities of default and timing of auction failure, probabilities of a successful auction at par and or repurchase at par value for each auction period, collateralization of the underlying security and credit worthiness of the issuer. Additionally, as the market for these securities continues to be inactive and the secondary market remains in developmental stages, our discounted cash flow model also factored the illiquidity of the auction rate securities market by adding a spread of 450 basis points to the applicable discount rate. Based on our analysis, we determined that our auction rate securities carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded an unrealized loss of $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax) on our auction rate securities, with the offset included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We assessed this decline in value to be temporary due to the following: our belief that we have the ability and the intent to hold these securities until the market stabilizes in order to sell the securities at par based on our cash and cash equivalents balance at August 31, 2008 and our operating cash flow; the high quality of the underlying collateral; 72 Table of Contents the high credit quality of the issuers; the fact that the issuers continue to pay interest in a timely manner; and the lack of defaults in the underlying debt. At August 31, 2008, we have classified the entire balance of our auction rate securities totaling $25.2 million, net of the unrealized loss of $1.6 million, as non current marketable securities due to the lack of liquidity of these instruments. We will continue to monitor our investment portfolio, and given the uncertainties in the global credit and capital markets, we are no longer investing in auction rate securities instruments at this time, which may contribute to reduced investment income in the future. We will also continue to evaluate any changes in the market value of the failed auction rate securities that have not been liquidated and depending upon existing market conditions, we may be required to record other than temporary impairment charges in the future. Cash Flows Operating Activities During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $726.0 million, $588.6 million, and $551.0 million, respectively. The following table provides a summary of our operating cash flows during the respective fiscal years: Year Ended August 31, ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 476.5 $ 408.8 $ 414.8 Non cash items 212.8 194.2 178.3 Changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 36.7 (14.4 ) (42.1 ) Net cash from operating activities $ 726.0 $ 588.6 $ 551.0 Fiscal year 2008 Our non cash items primarily consisted of a $104.2 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, $79.7 million for depreciation and amortization, and $53.6 million for share based compensation, which was partially offset by $18.6 million of excess tax benefits from share based compensation. The changes in certain operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an $85.3 million increase in student deposits and a $35.3 million increase in deferred revenue, both of which were primarily due to increased enrollment. This was partially offset by a $105.7 million increase in accounts receivable, also primarily due to increased enrollment. Fiscal year 2007 Our non cash items primarily consisted of a $120.6 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, $71.1 million for depreciation and amortization, and $54.0 million for share based compensation, which was partially offset by a $46.0 million increase in deferred income taxes. The changes in certain operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $150.9 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to increased enrollment, which was partially offset by a $73.9 million increase in student deposits and a $31.0 million increase in deferred revenue, also primarily due to increased enrollment, and a $31.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Fiscal year 2006 Our non cash items primarily consisted of an $101.0 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, $67.3 million for depreciation and amortization, $27.7 million for share based compensation and $20.2 million for an impairment of goodwill at our CFP reporting unit. These increases were partially offset by a $19.7 million increase in deferred income taxes and $17.5 million of excess tax benefits from share based compensation. The changes in certain operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an $89.0 million increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by a $20.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and an $11.5 million increase in student deposits. Accounts receivable is a significant component of our working capital. We monitor our accounts receivable through a variety of metrics, including days sales outstanding. We calculate our days sales outstanding by 73 Table of Contents determining average daily student revenue based on a rolling twelve month analysis and divide it into the gross student accounts receivable balance as of the end of the period. For purposes of this calculation, we have excluded student accounts receivable for UNIACC and ULA which was $29.9 million in the aggregate as of August 31, 2008, as well as the associated revenue. As of August 31, 2008, our days sales outstanding was 29 days as compared to 38 days as of August 31, 2007. The decrease in days sales outstanding is primarily due to improvements in our processing time for the receipt of student financial aid and the write off of approximately $125.7 million in previously reserved uncollectible accounts receivable during fiscal year 2008. Investing Activities During fiscal years 2008 and 2007, cash used for investing activities was $260.8 million and $131.9 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2006, cash provided by investing activities was $95.6 million. Fiscal year 2008 Cash used for investing activities primarily consisted of $104.9 million for capital expenditures (including $12.4 million for our new corporate headquarters), $93.8 million for acquisitions, including Aptimus and Apollo Globals purchases of UNIACC and ULA, and an $87.7 million increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents. This was partially offset by $25.5 million provided by net maturities of marketable securities. Fiscal year 2007 Cash used for investing activities primarily consisted of $104.6 million used for capital expenditures (including $43.4 million for our new corporate headquarters), a $58.2 million increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents, and $15.1 million used for the purchase of Insight Schools. This was partially offset by $46.0 million provided by net maturities of marketable securities. Fiscal year 2006 Cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $216.2 million provided by net maturities of marketable securities. This was partially offset by $111.2 million used for capital expenditures (including $66.6 million for our new corporate headquarters). All interests in our new headquarters land and buildings are held by wholly owned subsidiaries formed as limited liability entities. On June 20, 2006, we entered into an option agreement (which was amended on March 7, 2007) with Macquarie Riverpoint AZ, LLC. The option agreement granted Macquarie the option to purchase all membership interests in the consolidated subsidiaries that own our new headquarters land and buildings for approximately $170.0 million and simultaneously have the owning entities enter into a 12 year lease of these facilities with us. Macquarie made a deposit of $9.0 million in connection with this option. On March 6, 2008, we provided the final completion notices to Macquarie. In March 2008, we agreed to extend the option until May 1, 2008 for additional consideration of approximately $0.3 million. With our approval, Macquarie assigned its interest under the option agreement to a third party and the option agreement was further amended to extend the exercise date to June 6, 2008. The third party did not exercise the option. As a result, the option agreement expired and we retained the initial $9.0 million option payment plus interest of $0.5 million, which is included in interest income and other, net in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008. Financing Activities During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, cash used in financing activities was $321.0 million, $426.0 million, and $474.8 million, respectively. Fiscal year 2008 Cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of $454.4 million used for the repurchase of 9.8 million shares of our Class A common stock. This was partially offset by $103.0 million provided by stock option exercises. Fiscal year 2007 Cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of $437.7 million used for the repurchase of 7.2 million shares of our Class A common stock. Fiscal year 2006 Cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of $514.9 million used for the repurchase of 8.2 million shares of our Class A common stock, which was partially offset by $29.0 million provided by stock option exercises. 74 Table of Contents Shares of Apollo Group Class A common stock newly authorized for repurchase, repurchased and reissued, and the related total cost, for the last three fiscal years are as follows: Maximum Value of Total # of Shares Average Price Paid Shares Available (Numbers in millions, except per share data) Repurchased Cost per Share for Repurchase Treasury stock as of August 31, 2005 8.8 $ 645.7 $ 73.23 $ 51.0 New authorizations 600.0 Shares repurchased 8.2 514.9 63.00 (514.9 ) Shares reissued (1.5 ) (106.6 ) 69.15 Treasury stock as of August 31, 2006 15.5 $ 1,054.0 $ 68.23 $ 136.1 New authorizations 363.9 Shares repurchased 7.2 437.7 61.08 (437.7 ) Shares reissued (0.5 ) (30.3 ) 67.31 Treasury stock as of August 31, 2007 22.2 $ 1,461.4 $ 65.94 $ 62.3 New authorizations 892.1 Shares repurchased 9.8 454.4 46.25 (454.4 ) Shares reissued (2.5 ) (158.5 ) 64.65 Treasury stock as of August 31, 2008 29.5 $ 1,757.3 $ 59.50 $ 500.0 Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase outstanding shares of Apollo Group Class A common stock, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other considerations. There is no expiration date on the repurchase authorizations and repurchases occur at our discretion. Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and may include repurchases pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5 1 nondiscretionary trading programs. The amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will be made as market and business conditions warrant.

(3) Amounts consist of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recorded in accordance with FIN 48. The amounts are included in current and long term liabilities in our August 31, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. We are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. (4) Amount consists of undiscounted deferred compensation payments due to Dr. John G. Sperling, our Founder. We have no other material commercial commitments not included in the above table. 75 Table of Contents Federal and Private Student Loans During 2008, there were reports of various educational entities experiencing interruption of Title IV student loan funding, which includes federal loans guaranteed by the government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. We have not experienced any significant interruptions. In May 2008, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act was signed into law by the President. This Act gives the Department of Education temporary authority through June 30, 2010 to purchase student loans when there is inadequate capital to meet borrower demand. Additionally, the Act requires the Department of Education to implement a Lender of Last Resort program to be administered by a state designated guarantor. As an alternative to federally guaranteed loans, students may access Title IV loans through the Federal Direct Loan Program, which essentially eliminates the lender and the guarantor. Under this program, the federal government makes the loans directly to the students in partnership with the schools. While 77% of our revenues come from Title IV funds, private student loan funding only represented approximately 3% of our net revenue and 5% of our net revenue during fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. Student eligibility is based on creditworthiness. The current credit market conditions make it more difficult for our students to obtain financing for direct costs beyond the Title IV annual loan limits established by Congress (in May 2008, the Act increased the annual loan limits on federal unsubsidized student loans by $2,000, and also increased the aggregate loan limits on total federal student loans.). Third party private loans are generally utilized by students in the University of Phoenix bachelors degree programs. The fastest growing sector of our student body, University of Phoenix associates degree students, do not require private loans to cover the cost of their program as the tuition levels are below Title IV loan limits. To meet any shortfall in financing, we are exploring the utilization of institutional grant and scholarship programs as necessary to assist our students who may need private loans and cannot obtain them with remaining enrolled. Management does not expect a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows to result from reduced student access to private loans. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Impact of Inflation Inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk In fiscal year 2008, we recorded $2.8 million in foreign currency transaction losses. As we expand our international operations, we will conduct more transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, the volume of transactions in the various foreign currencies will continue to increase, thus increasing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We monitor foreign currency exchange rate risk through the analysis of market conditions and our foreign operations. Interest Rate Risk As of August 31, 2008, we held $895.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008, we earned interest income of $30.1 million. When the Federal Reserve Bank lowers the Federal Funds Rate, it generally results in a reduction in our interest rates. A decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates would have reduced our interest income by approximately $6.4 million in fiscal year 2008. Lower interest rates and the possibility of future Federal Funds Rate reductions may significantly reduce our interest income for fiscal year 2009. We monitor the interest rate risk by monitoring market conditions and the value of these assets. 76 Table of Contents As of August 31, 2008, we did not have significant short term or long term borrowings. Any future borrowings under our Bank Facility will be subject to interest rate risk and may be subject to foreign currency exchange risk. Please refer to Note 15, Financing, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. Auction Rate Securities Risk We have historically invested a portion of our unrestricted investment portfolio in high quality (A rated and above) tax exempt municipal securities, preferred stock and other auction rate securities. As of August 31, 2008, we had $26.8 million of principal invested in auction rate securities that experienced failed auctions. Due to uncertainty in the global credit and capital markets and other factors, investment banks and broker dealers have been less willing to support auction rate securities and many auction rate securities auctions have failed. We have completed a fair value analysis of our auction rate securities in response to the prolonged and continued lack of liquidity for these investments. Based on our analysis, we determined that our auction rate securities carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded an unrealized loss of $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax) on our auction rate securities, with the offset included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our discounted cash flow model factored the illiquidity of the auction rate securities market by adding a spread of 450 basis points to the applicable discount rate. An increase of 100 basis points in our discount rate assumption would have caused an additional decline in the fair market value of approximately $0.4 million. We will continue to monitor our investment portfolio, and given the uncertainties in the global credit and capital markets, we are no longer investing in auction rate securities instruments at this time, which may contribute to reduced investment income in the future. We will also continue to evaluate any changes in the market value of the failed auction rate securities that have not been liquidated and depending upon existing market conditions, we may be required to record other than temporary impairment charges in the future. 77
