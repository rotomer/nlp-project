Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2005 include integration costs of $4.8 million ($3 million after tax) related to the acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc., and costs of $1.6 million ($1 million after tax) related to a separation package for the Companys former President Chief 13 Table of Contents Operating Officer. In addition, National Welders contributed a full year of operating results in fiscal 2005 resulting in incremental sales of $128 million and operating income of $13 million versus fiscal 2004. Working capital increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 reflecting higher levels of hardgoods inventory and trade receivables in connection with overall sales growth. (2) As discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2004 include a fourth quarter special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax) reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. Fiscal 2004 results also include the fourth quarter consolidation of the National Welders joint venture in accordance with FIN 46R. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company used the Equity Method of Accounting for its investment in National Welders. Accordingly, the consolidation of National Welders under FIN 46R did not have an impact on the Companys net earnings. National Welders contributed $39 million of sales and $3 million of operating income in fiscal 2004. As of March 31, 2004, National Welders also contributed current assets of $30 million, total assets of $140 million, current liabilities of $21 million, and non current liabilities of $119 million (including a minority interest liability of $36 million). (3) As discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2003 include special and other charges of $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax) primarily consisting of a restructuring charge ($2.7 million) related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. (4) The results for fiscal 2002 include: (a) a non cash after tax charge of $59 million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), (b) a litigation settlement charge of $8.5 million ($5.7 million after tax), and (c) a net non recurring gain of $1.9 million ($120 thousand after tax) related to divestitures and a write down of a business held for sale to its net realizable value. (5) The results for fiscal 2001 include: (a) net special charges of $3.6 million ($2.3 million after tax), (b) litigation charges, net, of $5.8 million ($3.6 million after tax), and (c) asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates of $700 thousand after tax. Depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2001 reflects amortization of goodwill. Effective April 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and for years subsequent to fiscal 2001, goodwill was no longer amortized, rather it was tested for impairment. (6) At the end of each quarter during fiscal 2005 and 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.045 and $0.04 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 24, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable June 30, 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2005. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. 14 Table of Contents (7) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications include the presentation of depository cash, cash overdrafts, minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company has changed from a net cash presentation on the balance sheet to a gross presentation. Previously, the Company did not show cash balances as all depository cash and cash overdrafts were combined and the net overdraft was recorded in other current liabilities. In the current presentation, depository cash and cash overdrafts are presented on a gross basis. Accordingly, the Statement of Cash Flows for each year presented also reflects the change in presentation and reconciles to the change in cash on the balance sheet. The Company has adopted the current presentation as it is consistent with practice among most companies and is more transparent. Minority interest and equity earnings recognized in prior periods related to the Companys joint venture affiliate, National Welders, were reclassified from elements of earnings before income taxes to be presented net of tax below income tax expense. 15 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Item 7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 OVERVIEW The Companys net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005) were $2.41 billion compared to $1.90 billion in the prior year (fiscal 2004). Sales growth of $516 million was driven by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the consolidation of National Welders, a joint venture affiliate of the Company. The Company estimates that acquisitions contributed sales of approximately $197 million during fiscal 2005, the largest of which was the acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. (BOC). Same store sales growth of 9% contributed sales of approximately $191 million reflecting the rebounding economy and strength in industrial markets served by the Company. The consolidation of National Welders, effective December 31, 2003 (fiscal 2004), contributed incremental sales of $128 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 net earnings were $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. As discussed in the Income Statement Commentary below, fiscal 2005 results were affected by the following: integration costs of $4.8 million ($3 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the BOC acquisition; and a separation package for the Companys former President Chief Operating Officer of $1.6 million ($1 million after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share. Fiscal 2004 results were affected by the following: insurance related losses of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, representing the Companys self insurance retention associated with fire related losses; a $1.7 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, non recurring insurance gain recognized by National Welders; and a special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. During fiscal 2005, the Company completed 16 acquisitions (including two businesses acquired by National Welders) with combined annual sales of approximately $260 million. The largest of the acquisitions was that of the U.S. packaged gas business of BOC, which closed on July 30, 2004. The Company acquired the BOC assets for approximately $175 million cash, plus up to $25 million to be paid on or about November 15, 2005. The $25 million contingent portion of the purchase price is based on the Company achieving certain financial targets. The transaction was financed through borrowings on the Companys U.S. revolving credit facility. The acquired business generated approximately $240 million in revenue in its fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. The acquired operations have been predominately included in the Distribution segment. The Company had strong same store sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2005. The Company believes that it is in the middle of a traditional economic recovery cycle in which gas supply has tightened and cylinder gas volumes are growing. Fiscal 2005 same store sales growth benefited from continued success of the Companys strategic product sales initiatives related to medical, bulk, specialty gases and 16 Table of Contents safety products. Sales of hardgoods were especially strong during the year with significant gains related to safety products and traditional welding products, such as welding wire, rods, torches and other welding accessories. During the third fiscal quarter and into the fourth quarter, the Company experienced pressure on gross profit margins and rising operating expenses. These cost pressures factored into the Companys decision to raise prices on a number of its product lines in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, with respect to its joint venture with National Welders and consolidated this formerly unconsolidated affiliate. Beginning January 1, 2004 and for the year ended March 31, 2005, National Welders operating results were reflected broadly across the income statement in the All Other Operations business segment with minority interest expense representing the preferred stockholders proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings were reflected as Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, National Welders contributed $39 million to sales, $3 million to operating income, and $452 thousand of minority interest expense. In fiscal 2005, National Welders was consolidated for the full 12 month period and contributed $167 million to sales, $16 million to operating income, and $1.8 million of minority interest expense. Net earnings were not impacted by the consolidation of National Welders. During fiscal 2005, the Company also completed its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (the Act). Compliance with the Act and the preparation for the newly required assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, required the allocation of a significant level of internal resources. However, compliance with the Act did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. The Companys report on internal control and the associated report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Looking forward, the Company anticipates that fiscal 2006 will be another productive year with new challenges and opportunities. The Company anticipates further expansion of the industrial economy during fiscal 2006 and estimates that fiscal 2006 net earnings will be approximately $1.43 to $1.50 per diluted share. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company estimates that it will earn $0.33 to $0.36 per diluted share. The estimate of fiscal 2006 net earnings anticipates a supportive sales environment and continued success of pricing actions designed to offset rising costs. Actual fiscal 2006 net earnings may be impacted by a number of factors including continued improvement in the industrial economy, customer acceptance of price increases, the sales mix of gas and rent versus hardgoods, and the interest rate environment, among other factors. Acquisitions in fiscal 2006 could also continue to be an important component of the Companys growth. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed the acquisitions of the Industrial Products Division of LaRoche Industries, a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $65 million, and Kanox, Inc., a Kansas based distributor of packaged gases and related hardgoods with annual sales of approximately $23 million. The Company also remains focused on integrating BOCs packaged gas business into the Companys distribution network, which is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2006. In addition, the Company set certain long term financial goals for fiscal 2008, including achieving annual sales of $3 billion and operating margins of 10% 11% of sales. 17 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 27% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 driven primarily by acquisitions, strong same store sales growth of 9% and the consolidation of National Welders. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 2,078,739 $ 1,702,471 $ 376,268 22 % All Other Operations 385,611 235,926 149,685 63 % Intercompany eliminations (52,941 ) (42,929 ) (10,012 ) $ 2,411,409 $ 1,895,468 $ 515,941 27 % The Distribution segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases; process chemicals; equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases and process chemicals are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies. Distribution segment sales increased $376 million (22%) compared to the prior year driven by acquisitions (principally the BOC acquisition) and growth in same store sales. The BOC acquisition and other smaller acquisitions contributed estimated incremental sales of $192 million in fiscal 2005. Distribution same store sales growth of $184 million (10%) resulted from hardgoods sales gains of $125 million (14%) and gas and rent sales growth of $59 million (6%). Hardgoods sales growth resulted from price and volume gains consistent with the solid industrial recovery across many of the markets served by the Company. For example, same store sales of welding wire and welding accessories (e.g. welding machines, torches) increased by approximately $40 million and $25 million, respectively. The costs of welding wire and accessories were significantly impacted by rising steel prices in fiscal 2005. The Company successfully passed through the higher costs to its customers. Same store sales of safety products increased approximately $40 million and were positively impacted by the Companys strategy of cross selling safety products to its broad base of customers. Radnor private label sales growth of 36% was also indicative of the success of the Companys branch store core stocking program. The Companys core stocking program ensures that each branch store is stocked with the most commonly demanded hardgoods products. The Company follows a strategy that focuses on products and markets that are expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy. These products include medical and specialty gases, gases sold in bulk and micro bulk containers, safety products, and sales to strategic account customers (large customers with multiple locations). Fiscal 2005 gas and rent same store sales growth was driven by these products as well as the strengthened industrial economy. Medical gas and rent sales grew 5% to $169 million in fiscal 2005 driven by the strength of the Airgas Puritan Medical business model, which includes a far reaching network of locations, superior customer service and innovative programs, such as the Walk O2 Bout medical cylinder program utilized by hospitals and the home healthcare market. Same store sales of specialty gases increased 4% to $157 million in fiscal 2005. Bulk gas and rent revenues grew 10% to over $120 million reflecting higher volumes. Sales to strategic account customers also contributed to the growth in gas, rent and hardgoods same store sales. Growth in industrial gases (e.g. acetylene, helium, argon) were also solid contributors. Rental revenue was also favorably impacted by a 7% increase in welding equipment rentals and sales associated with the Companys rental welder fleet. 18 Table of Contents The All Other Operations segment consists of producers and distributors of gas products, principally of dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. The segment also includes the Companys National Welders joint venture, which was consolidated effective December 31, 2003. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany sales eliminations, increased $140 million, principally from the consolidation of National Welders and same store sales growth. National Welders contributed sales of $167 million in fiscal 2005 versus $39 million in the prior year (fourth quarter only). Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, it would have contributed sales of $147 million. Same store sales growth was principally the result of higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice and industrial gas volume gains at National Welders. Dry ice sales volume gains were dampened by pricing pressure in this competitive market. Gross Profits Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. As disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company reflects distribution costs as elements of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment on the income statement line item Depreciation. Some companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their Cost of Products Sold. Consequently, gross profits discussed below may not be comparable to those of other entities. Gross profits increased 25% resulting from higher sales volumes generated by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the consolidation of National Welders. Although the gross profit dollars were higher, the gross profit margin decreased 100 basis points to 51.1% in fiscal 2005 compared to 52.1% in fiscal 2004. The decline in the gross profit margin was partially due to lower gas margins experienced during the second half of fiscal 2005 resulting from lower margins of the acquired BOC business and higher sales of lower margin bulk gases. The pressure on margins factored into the Companys decision to raise prices on a number of its product lines in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Related to hardgoods products, the entire industry has been impacted by the rapidly rising price of steel, a primary component of welding wire and rods. However, the gross profit margin on hardgoods was relatively consistent with the prior year as the product cost increases were effectively passed through to customers. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 1,021,192 $ 857,031 $ 164,161 19 % All Other Operations 211,172 129,756 81,416 63 % $ 1,232,364 $ 986,787 $ 245,577 25 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $164 million (19%) compared to the prior year driven by acquisitions and same store sales growth. The Distribution segments gross profit margin of 49.1% in fiscal 2005 decreased 120 basis points from 50.3% in fiscal 2004. The lower gross profit margin resulted from the higher same store sales growth rates for hardgoods versus gas and rent sales. Hardgoods carry a lower gross profit margin versus gas and rent sales and helped drive the decline in the gross profit margin. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 50.8% gas and rent compared to 51.8% in fiscal 2004. The gross profit margin was also impacted by lower margins from the acquired BOC business and higher sales of lower margin bulk gases. Higher cylinder maintenance and freight in costs associated with sales growth also contributed to the lower gross profit margin. The Company anticipates that the gross profit margin will rise in fiscal 2006 reflecting the full impact of the price increases as well as continued gas volume growth. All Other Operations gross profits increased $81 million (63%) compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the consolidation of National Welders. National Welders contributed $70 million to the increase in gross profits. The remainder of the increase in gross profits reflects higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice. The All Other Operations gross profit margin was relatively consistent compared to the prior year. 19 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SDA) consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. SDA expenses increased $186 million (25%) compared to the prior year principally from the consolidation of National Welders and costs contributed by acquisitions. A full year of expenses related to National Welders contributed $65 million in SDA expenses versus $16 million for the fourth quarter in the prior year. Acquisitions contributed an estimated $86 million in SDA expenses. The remainder of the increase resulted from higher labor, utility and distribution related expenses. Labor and utility expense increases reflected costs to fill cylinders and operate facilities to meet increased demand for products. The increase in distribution related expenses of approximately $8 million was primarily driven by higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was directly related to higher oil prices during fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 also included costs of $4.8 million associated with the integration of the BOC business into the Companys operations and $1.6 million for a separation package for the former Chief Operating Officer. Acquisition integration expenses were not significant during fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, the Company sustained fire related losses of $2.8 million at certain of its plants. As a percentage of sales, SDA expenses decreased 50 basis points to 38.1% versus 38.6% in the prior year driven by higher sales volumes and improving cost leverage. Depreciation expense of $106 million in fiscal 2005 increased $23 million (28%) compared to $83 million in fiscal 2004. National Welders contributed $9 million in additional depreciation expense and acquisitions contributed approximately $8 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the current and prior years capital investments in revenue producing assets, including medical cylinders and bulk tanks. The Companys lease buyout program to purchase long lived assets subject to high cost leases also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense in fiscal 2005. Amortization expense in fiscal 2005 of $5.5 million was consistent with the prior year. Operating Income Operating income increased 21% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 driven by higher sales and the consolidation of National Welders. The operating income margin decreased 50 basis points to 8.4% from 8.9% in the prior year. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 158,018 $ 136,449 $ 21,569 16 % All Other Operations 45,215 31,331 13,884 44 % $ 203,233 $ 167,780 $ 35,453 21 % The Distribution segments operating income margin of 7.6% in fiscal 2005 decreased 40 basis points compared to 8.0% in the prior year. BOC integration costs and the separation package for the Companys former Chief Operating Officer contributed 30 basis points to the decline in the operating income margin. The decrease in the operating income margin also reflected the lower gross profit margin, described above. The All Other Operations segments operating income margin decreased 160 basis points to 11.7% from 13.3% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the operating income margin primarily resulted from the consolidation of National Welders, which carries a lower operating income margin compared to the other businesses in the All Other Operations segment. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the comparable operating income margin would have been 11.5%. 20 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $56 million representing an increase of $10 million (22%) compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense primarily resulted from higher debt levels associated with acquisitions, principally the BOC acquisition. The increase in interest expense was also driven by higher weighted average interest rates. The consolidation of National Welders contributed $2 million to the increase in interest expense. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $190 million and $163 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates at March 31, 2005 was 61% fixed to 39% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Based on the Companys outstanding variable rate debt and credit rating at March 31, 2005, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates its annual interest expense would increase approximately $1 million. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 36.8% of pre tax earnings in fiscal 2005 compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2004. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2005 resulted from changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the realization of federal and state tax credits. Minority Interest and Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate In fiscal 2005, the Company modified its presentation of minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to improve the presentation of the relationship between earnings before taxes and income tax expense. The new presentation reflects both the minority interest related to National Welders and the equity income recognized in prior periods related to National Welders, net of tax, below income tax expense. The Company also reclassified earnings of its partnership interest in AC Industries from equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to other income (expense). The reclassifications have been reflected in all prior periods to conform with the new presentation. Minority interest expense represents the portion of National Welders earnings applicable to the preferred stockholders of National Welders. Minority interest expense in fiscal 2005 represents a full year of expense versus one quarter in fiscal 2004, reflecting the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in fiscal 2004 of $4.4 million represents the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings through the date of consolidation. National Welders earnings included a $1.7 million after tax life insurance gain in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. Prior to the date that the Company entered into the joint venture agreement with National Welders, the founders of National Welders had obtained life insurance policies on key personnel in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. 21 Table of Contents Net Earnings Net earnings in fiscal 2005 were $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. The weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per diluted share increased by 2.3 million shares in fiscal 2005. The increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding primarily related to stock option exercises and shares purchased by employees under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plans. The Company expects that the weighted average number of shares outstanding will continue to increase by 2% to 3% per year. 22 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 OVERVIEW The Companys net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004) were $1.90 billion compared to $1.79 billion in the prior year (fiscal 2003). Sales growth of $109 million was driven by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. During fiscal 2004, the Company completed five acquisitions with combined annual sales of approximately $59 million. Strategic product sales initiatives related to medical, bulk and specialty gases, and strategic accounts, contributed to a 1% increase in total same store sales. Sales growth was achieved despite weakness in the manufacturing and industrial markets during much of fiscal 2004. While same store sales were flat through the first nine months of fiscal 2004, they began rebounding in the fourth quarter led by sales of hardgoods, which increased significantly (9%) as the industrial marketplace began to show signs of an economic recovery. Gas and rent sales also showed improvement (2%) in the fiscal fourth quarter. Fiscal 2004 net earnings were $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. As discussed in the Income Statement Commentary below, fiscal 2004 results were affected by the following: insurance related losses of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, representing the Companys self insurance retention associated with fire related losses; a $1.7 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, non recurring insurance gain recognized by National Welders; and a special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. Fiscal 2003 results were affected by the following: special and other charges totaling $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, primarily consisting of a restructuring charge ($2.7 million) related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) in fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. At December 31, 2003, the Company elected to adopt FIN 46R with respect to its joint venture with National Welders and consolidated this formerly unconsolidated affiliate. Since June 1996, the Company has participated in the joint venture and has used the equity method of accounting to report the Companys proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. Consequently, the consolidation of National Welders had no impact on the net earnings of the Company. In addition, the consolidation did not change the fact that the liabilities of the joint venture are non recourse to the Company and the cash flows, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders, are not available to the Company. Through the nine months ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized $4.4 million of Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate related to National Welders. With the prospective adoption permitted by FIN 46R (prior periods not restated), the fourth fiscal quarter operating results of the joint venture were reflected broadly across the income statement with minority interest expense reflecting the preferred stockholders proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, National Welders contributed $39 million to sales, $3 million to operating income, $452 thousand of minority interest expense and $1 million in net earnings. 23 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 6% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 driven primarily by acquisitions, same store sales growth of 1% and the consolidation of National Welders. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 1,702,471 $ 1,642,076 $ 60,395 4 % All Other Operations 235,926 183,849 52,077 28 % Intercompany eliminations (42,929 ) (38,961 ) (3,968 ) $ 1,895,468 $ 1,786,964 $ 108,504 6 % Distribution segment sales increased $60 million (4%) driven by acquisitions and growth in same store sales. The Company estimates that business acquisitions contributed $39 million to sales in fiscal 2004. Same store sales growth of $21 million (1%) resulted from increases in hardgoods sales of $13 million (1%) and gas and rent sales of $8 million (1%). Through the first nine months of fiscal 2004, Distribution same store sales were negative, driven by lower sales of hardgoods reflecting weakness in the industrial and manufacturing sectors of the economy. However, same store sales of hardgoods increased significantly (9%) in the fiscal fourth quarter as the industrial marketplace began to show signs of an economic recovery. Gas and rent sales also showed improvement (2%) in the fiscal fourth quarter. Same store sales of safety products increased a strong 6% during fiscal 2004 as the Company continued its cross selling strategy of marketing safety products to its broad base of customers. During fiscal 2004, strategic product sales initiatives contributed to sales growth of gas and rent, which helped mitigate weakness in the industrial economy. Medical gas and rent revenues increased 8% to $146 million versus the prior year reflecting volume gains. Sales growth of specialty gases fell short of expectations, driven by pricing pressure and sluggish demand associated with economic conditions. Bulk gas and rent revenues grew 8% to $107 million reflecting higher volumes as well as the promotion of the Companys micro bulk program. The micro bulk program is designed to service niche customers who require higher volumes of gases than can be provided efficiently through the use of gases packaged in cylinders. Sales to strategic account customers (sales to large customers with multiple locations) increased 3% to $255 million in fiscal 2004. Rental revenue was also favorably impacted by a 7% increase in welding equipment rentals and sales associated with the Companys continued expansion of its rental welder fleet. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany sales eliminations, increased $48 million (33%), principally from the consolidation of National Welders, same store sales growth and an acquisition during fiscal 2004. National Welders contributed sales of $39 million in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, it would have contributed sales of $147 million. Same store sales growth of 5% was principally the result of higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide reflecting the additional source of product from the Hopewell, Virginia plant that began operations in January 2003. Same store sales growth associated with liquid carbon dioxide was partially offset by lower sales of dry ice. Sales of dry ice were negatively impacted during fiscal 2004 by significant pricing pressure related to additional competition in the market. The acquisition of a dry ice business in April 2003 also contributed sales of $2 million in fiscal 2004. 24 Table of Contents Gross Profits Gross profits increased 5%, while the gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points to 52.1% in fiscal 2004 compared to 52.4% in fiscal 2003. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 857,031 $ 835,756 $ 21,275 3 % All Other Operations 129,756 100,892 28,864 29 % $ 986,787 $ 936,648 $ 50,139 5 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $21 million (3%) compared to the prior year. Distributions gross profit margin of 50.3% in fiscal 2004 decreased 60 basis points from 50.9% in fiscal 2003. The lower gross profit margin primarily resulted from a shift in sales mix away from higher margin gas and rent sales and towards lower margin sales of hardgoods. Acquisitions of two distributors of safety products also contributed to the shift in mix. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 51.8% gas and rent compared to 52.6% in fiscal 2003. All Other Operations gross profits increased $29 million (29%) compared to the prior year. Higher gross profits primarily reflect the consolidation of National Welders, higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide sourced from the new Hopewell, Virginia plant and an acquisition. The consolidation of National Welders contributed gross profits of $22 million. The gross profit margin of 55% was flat compared to 54.9% in the prior year. The fourth quarter consolidation of National Welders had an insignificant impact on the gross profit margin. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the impact on the All Other Operations segments gross profit margin would also not have been significant. Operating Expenses SDA expenses increased $34 million (5%) compared to the prior year principally from the consolidation of National Welders, higher distribution related expenses, costs contributed by acquired businesses and fire related losses. The consolidation of National Welders contributed $16 million to the increase in SDA expenses. The increase in distribution related expenses of approximately $5 million was primarily driven by higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the increase in oil prices during fiscal 2004. Acquired businesses contributed approximately $13 million to the increase in SDA expenses. During fiscal 2004, the Company sustained fire related losses at certain of its plants of $2.8 million, which represented the Companys self insurance retention. The prior year included costs of $2.7 million associated with the integration of the packaged gas business acquired from Air Products in February 2002. Acquisition integration expenses were not significant during fiscal 2004. As a percentage of net sales, SDA expenses decreased 50 basis points to 38.6% compared to 39.1% in the prior year. Depreciation expense of $83 million in fiscal 2004 increased $9 million (12%) compared to $74 million in fiscal 2003. The increase reflects depreciation on the current and prior years capital investments in revenue producing assets, including the Hopewell carbon dioxide plant, bulk and micro bulk tanks and medical cylinders. The fourth quarter consolidation of National Welders also contributed approximately $3 million to the increase in depreciation expense. Amortization expense of $5.4 million in fiscal 2004 decreased $1 million compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in amortization expense was primarily attributable to the expiration of certain non compete agreements. 25 Table of Contents Special Charges (Recoveries) In fiscal 2004, a special charge recovery of $776 thousand consisted of lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring charges. The special charge recovery was included in the Distribution segment and represented a change in estimate related to facility exit costs. In fiscal 2003, the Company recognized a special charge of $2.7 million related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. The special charge included facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain facilities and employee severance. The facilities exited and the affected employees were part of the Companys existing operations prior to the acquisition of the Air Products business. Operating Income Operating income increased 8% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The operating income margin increased 20 basis points to 8.9% from 8.7% in the prior year. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 136,449 $ 130,534 $ 5,915 5 % All Other Operations 31,331 25,348 5,983 24 % $ 167,780 $ 155,882 $ 11,898 8 % The Distribution segments operating income margin of 8% in fiscal 2004 was consistent with 7.9% in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2004 operating income margin reflects the lower gross profit margin, described above, effectively offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. The All Other Operations segments operating income margin decreased 50 basis points to 13.3% compared to 13.8% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the operating income margin primarily resulted from higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales driven by the consolidation of National Welders. National Welders has a higher cost structure compared to the other businesses included in the segment. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the operating income margin would have been 11.5%. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled approximately $46 million representing a decrease of $4 million ( 8%) compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in interest expense resulted from lower average outstanding debt levels and lower weighted average interest rates associated with the Companys variable rate debt. The Companys interest expense and average outstanding debt levels were lower despite the July 1, 2003 consolidation of a grantor trust associated with an operating lease and the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $163 million and $159 million at March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates at March 31, 2004 was 57% fixed to 43% variable. 26 Table of Contents Minority Interest and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate Minority interest expense represents the portion of National Welders earnings applicable to the preferred stockholders of National Welders. Minority interest expense in fiscal 2004 represents one quarter of expense as a result of the December 31, 2003 consolidation. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in fiscal 2004 of $4.4 million represents the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings through the date of consolidation. The increase in fiscal 2004 equity earnings compared to fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from a $1.7 million after tax life insurance gain in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.3% of pre tax earnings in fiscal 2004 compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2003. Net Earnings Net earnings in fiscal 2004 were $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. 27 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2005 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $222 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $211 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2005 operating cash flows resulted from higher net earnings adjusted for non cash items and cash provided by the trade receivables securitization, partially offset by an increase in cash used by working capital. Net earnings adjusted for non cash items provided cash of $246 million versus $194 million in fiscal 2004. Working capital used cash of $52 million in 2005 versus providing cash of $13 million in 2004. Working capital components used cash in fiscal 2005 reflecting higher levels of hardgoods inventory and trade receivables in connection with overall sales growth. The Company increased the level of receivables sold under its trade receivables securitization program generating incremental cash compared to 2004 of $24 million. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 were primarily used to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. Cash from operations in fiscal 2005 includes $20 million of cash provided by National Welders compared to $10 million associated with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The cash flows of National Welders, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders to the Company, are not available to the Company. Prior to the fourth quarter 2004 consolidation of National Welders, the management fee paid by National Welders to the Company was reflected as an investing activity as fees from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash used in investing activities totaled $353 million and primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions of $192 million and capital expenditures of $168 million. Acquisitions in fiscal 2005 primarily consisted of $175 million paid for the BOC acquisition. Capital expenditures were $74 million higher than in fiscal 2004 driven by spending for cylinders and bulk tanks reflecting continued investment to support the Companys strategic sales initiatives, such as those related to medical and bulk gases. In addition, fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included $35 million ($11 million at National Welders) of real estate and tube trailer lease buyouts under a program to purchase long lived assets that were subject to high cost operating leases. For fiscal 2006, the Company estimates that capital spending will approximate 5% of sales. Financing activities provided cash of $139 million primarily from borrowings, which were raised to fund the BOC acquisition. Financing activities also included proceeds of $20 million received from the exercise of stock options. Dividends paid to stockholders during fiscal 2005 used cash of $14 million. Beginning with this annual report on Form 10 K, the Company has changed from a net cash presentation on the balance sheet to a gross presentation. Previously, the Company did not show cash balances as all depository cash and cash overdrafts were combined and the net overdraft was recorded in other current liabilities. In the current presentation, depository cash and cash overdrafts are presented on a gross basis. The Company has adopted the current presentation as it is consistent with the practice among most companies and is also more transparent. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The Company will continue to look for acquisitions to complement its existing businesses and improve its geographic coverage. Capital expenditures, current debt maturities and any future acquisitions will be funded through the use of cash flow from operations, revolving credit facilities, and other financing alternatives. The Company believes that its sources of financing are adequate for its anticipated needs and that it could arrange additional sources of financing for unanticipated requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangement depend on the market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time. 28 Table of Contents Dividends At the end of each quarter during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.045 and $0.040 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 24, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share, representing a 33% increase compared to the prior year quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable June 30, 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2005. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Instruments Senior Credit Agreement On January 14, 2005, the Company amended and restated its senior credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) to extend the maturity date from July 30, 2006 to January 14, 2010 and to provide the Company with more flexibility to invest in growth and or return cash to stockholders. Accordingly, the Credit Agreement significantly reduces the limitations on acquisitions, restricted payments and debt incurrence. The Credit Agreement also allows for the expansion of the Companys trade receivables securitization up to a maximum of $300 million in trade receivables. The Credit Agreement continues to require that the Company maintain certain leverage and coverage ratios. As provided for in the Credit Agreement, the computations of the restrictive covenants include pro forma results of acquired businesses. As such, the amount borrowed to finance an acquisition does not reduce the Companys borrowing capacity by a similar amount. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company has unsecured senior credit facilities that provide revolving credit lines of $308 million and Canadian $50 million and a term loan. As of March 31, 2005, the Company had revolving credit borrowings of approximately $136 million, Canadian $27 million (U.S. $22 million), and term loan borrowings of $96 million. The Company also had commitments under letters of credit of $33 million supported by the Credit Agreement at March 31, 2005. After considering the covenant limitations, as of March 31, 2005, the effective additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was approximately U.S. $159 million. The U.S. dollar borrowings bear interest of LIBOR plus 95 basis points and the Canadian dollar borrowings bear interest at the Canadian Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 95 basis points. As of March 31, 2005, the effective interest rate on the U.S. dollar revolving credit lines, the Canadian dollar credit lines and the U.S. dollar term loan were 3.74%, 4.67% and 4.04%, respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, the Companys domestic subsidiaries guarantee the U.S. borrowings and Canadian borrowings, and the Companys foreign subsidiaries also guarantee the Canadian borrowings. The guarantees are full and unconditional and are made on a joint and several basis. The Company has pledged 100% of the stock of its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries as surety for its obligations under the agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for the release of the guarantees and collateral if the Company attains an investment grade credit rating and maintains such rating for two consecutive quarters. 29 Table of Contents Medium Term Notes At March 31, 2005, the Company had $100 million of medium term notes due September 2006 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%. The medium term notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities. The Company has pledged the stock of its domestic guarantors for the benefit of the note holders. Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long term debt also included acquisition and other notes principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2005, acquisition and other notes totaled approximately $10 million with interest rates ranging from 4% to 9%. Senior Subordinated Notes At March 31, 2005, the Company had $150 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2004 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of July 15, 2014. The 2004 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2004 notes have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2004 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is July 15, 2009 at a price of 103.1% of the principal amount. In addition to the 2004 Notes, at March 31, 2005, the Company had $225 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2001 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of October 1, 2011. The 2001 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.125%, payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2001 notes also have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2001 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is October 1, 2006 at a price of 104.6% of the principal amount. The 2004 Notes and 2001 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The 2004 Notes and 2001 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities. The stock of the Companys domestic subsidiaries is also pledged to the note holders on a subordinated basis. Financial Instruments of the National Welders Joint Venture Pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46R, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2005 and 2004 include the financial obligations of National Welders. National Welders financial obligations are non recourse to the Company, meaning that the creditors of National Welders do not have a claim on the assets of Airgas, Inc. National Welders has a credit agreement (the NWS Credit Agreement) that provides for available credit up to $100 million secured by certain assets. The NWS Credit Agreement provides for a Term Loan A of $26 million, a Term Loan B of $21 million, a Term Loan C of $9 million, and a revolving credit line of $44 million. Term Loan A is repayable in monthly amounts of $254 thousand with a lump sum payment of the outstanding balance at maturity in June 2007. Term Loan B (See subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) matures in July 2006 and Term Loan C matures in 30 Table of Contents September 2006. The revolving credit line matures in June 2007. The NWS Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, limit the ability of National Welders to incur and guarantee new indebtedness, subject National Welders to minimum net worth requirements, and limit its capital expenditures, ownership changes, merger and acquisition activity, and the payment of dividends. At March 31, 2005, National Welders had borrowings under its revolving credit line of $22 million, under Term Loan A of $18 million, under Term Loan B of $21 million, and under Term C of $3.5 million. Interest rates on Term Loans A, B and the revolving credit line are variable and range from LIBOR plus 150 to 225 basis points based on National Welders leverage ratio. At March 31, 2005, the effective interest rate for Term Loans A, B and the revolving credit line was 4.85%. Term Loan C bears a fixed interest rate of 7%. Based on restrictions related to certain leverage ratios, National Welders had additional borrowing capacity under its NWS Credit Agreement of approximately $22 million at March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2005, Term Loan A and the revolving credit line are secured by certain current assets, principally trade receivables and inventory, totaling $30 million, non current assets, principally equipment, totaling $71 million, and Airgas common stock with a market value of $22 million classified as treasury stock and carried at cost of $370 thousand. Term Loan B is secured by a $21 million note receivable from the preferred stockholders of National Welders (See Subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In consolidation, the note receivable is presented as a reduction to the minority interest liability. Term Loan C is secured by a production facility, which had a net book value of approximately $14 million at March 31, 2005. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company and National Welders manage exposure to changes in market interest rates. At March 31, 2005, the Company was party to a total of four interest rate swap agreements. The swap agreements are with major financial institutions and aggregate $100 million in notional principal amount. These swap agreements require the Company to make fixed interest payments based on an average effective rate of 3.59% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on one month and three month LIBOR (average rate of 2.73% at March 31, 2005). The remaining terms of these swap agreements range from between seven months and four years. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties. On March 30, 2005, the Company terminated four variable interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of $125 million. The interest rate swap agreements previously converted a corresponding amount of fixed rate medium term notes and the senior subordinated notes due 2011 to variable rate debt. As a result of swap termination, the Company received $3.9 million in cash. The corresponding gain on the termination has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the notes. National Welders participates in one interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of $21 million on which it makes interest payments based on a fixed rate of 6.72% and receives variable interest payments from its counterparty based on a floating 30 day LIBOR rate of 2.85% at March 31, 2005 (See subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates was approximately 61% fixed to 39% variable at March 31, 2005. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the LIBOR. Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio at March 31, 2005, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $1 million. 31 Table of Contents Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in February 2008, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. During fiscal 2005, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $2,204 million of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $2,177 million in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $190 million at March 31, 2005 and $163 million at March 31, 2004. The transaction has been accounted for as a sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Under the securitization agreement, eligible trade receivables are sold to bank conduits through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying value of the receivables is recognized as Discount on securitization of trade receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings and varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. The Company retains a subordinated interest in the receivables sold, which is recorded at the receivables previous carrying value. A subordinated retained interest of approximately $57 million and $44 million is included in Trade receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys retained interest is generally collected within 60 days. On a monthly basis, management measures the fair value of the retained interest at managements best estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the transferred receivables. Changes in the fair value are recognized as bad debt expense. Actual cash collections may differ from these estimates and would directly affect the fair value of the retained interest. In accordance with a servicing agreement, the Company continues to service, administer and collect the trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits approximate the costs of collections. Debt of Grantor Trust In October 2004, the Company used funds from its revolving credit facilities to refinance its $41 million debt obligation under a sale leaseback arrangement with a grantor trust. Since the Company had previously consolidated the grantor trust in July 2003 in accordance with the adoption of FIN 46, there was no net change in the Companys outstanding debt as a result of the maturity of the sale leaseback arrangement. Employee Benefits Trust Since March 1999, the Company has maintained an Employee Benefits Trust (the Trust) to fund certain future obligations of the Companys employee benefit and compensation plans. From inception through 2001, the Company, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, sold approximately 7 million shares of common stock, previously held as treasury stock, to the Trust. The Company holds promissory notes from the Trust in the amount of common stock purchased by the trust. Shares held by the Trust serve as collateral for the promissory notes and are available to fund certain employee benefit plan obligations as the promissory notes are repaid. The shares held by the Employee Benefits Trust are not considered outstanding for earnings per share purposes until they are released from serving as collateral for the promissory notes. Approximately 1.9 million and 1.2 million shares were issued from the Employee Benefits Trust for employee benefit programs during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of March 31, 2005, the Employee Benefits Trust held 338 thousand shares of Company common stock. The remaining shares were issued from the Trust during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for employee stock option exercises. 32 Table of Contents Inflation While the U.S. inflation rate has been relatively modest for several years, rising costs continue to affect the Companys business. The Company strives to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment and price increases under highly competitive conditions. OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2004 include a fourth quarter special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax) reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. Fiscal 2004 results also include the fourth quarter consolidation of the National Welders joint venture in accordance with FIN 46R. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company used the Equity Method of Accounting for its investment in National Welders. Accordingly, the consolidation of National Welders under FIN 46R did not have an impact on the Companys net earnings. National Welders contributed $39 million of sales and $3 million of operating income in fiscal 2004. As of March 31, 2004, National Welders also contributed current assets of $30 million, total assets of $140 million, current liabilities of $21 million, and non current liabilities of $119 million (including a minority interest liability of $36 million). (3) As discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2003 include special and other charges of $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax) primarily consisting of a restructuring charge ($2.7 million) related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. (4) The results for fiscal 2002 include: (a) a non cash after tax charge of $59 million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), (b) a litigation settlement charge of $8.5 million ($5.7 million after tax), and (c) a net non recurring gain of $1.9 million ($120 thousand after tax) related to divestitures and a write down of a business held for sale to its net realizable value. (5) The results for fiscal 2001 include: (a) net special charges of $3.6 million ($2.3 million after tax), (b) litigation charges, net, of $5.8 million ($3.6 million after tax), and (c) asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates of $700 thousand after tax. Depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2001 reflects amortization of goodwill. Effective April 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and for years subsequent to fiscal 2001, goodwill was no longer amortized, rather it was tested for impairment. (6) At the end of each quarter during fiscal 2005 and 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.045 and $0.04 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 24, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable June 30, 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2005. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. 14 Table of Contents (7) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications include the presentation of depository cash, cash overdrafts, minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company has changed from a net cash presentation on the balance sheet to a gross presentation. Previously, the Company did not show cash balances as all depository cash and cash overdrafts were combined and the net overdraft was recorded in other current liabilities. In the current presentation, depository cash and cash overdrafts are presented on a gross basis. Accordingly, the Statement of Cash Flows for each year presented also reflects the change in presentation and reconciles to the change in cash on the balance sheet. The Company has adopted the current presentation as it is consistent with practice among most companies and is more transparent. Minority interest and equity earnings recognized in prior periods related to the Companys joint venture affiliate, National Welders, were reclassified from elements of earnings before income taxes to be presented net of tax below income tax expense. 15 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Item 7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 OVERVIEW The Companys net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005) were $2.41 billion compared to $1.90 billion in the prior year (fiscal 2004). Sales growth of $516 million was driven by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the consolidation of National Welders, a joint venture affiliate of the Company. The Company estimates that acquisitions contributed sales of approximately $197 million during fiscal 2005, the largest of which was the acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. (BOC). Same store sales growth of 9% contributed sales of approximately $191 million reflecting the rebounding economy and strength in industrial markets served by the Company. The consolidation of National Welders, effective December 31, 2003 (fiscal 2004), contributed incremental sales of $128 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 net earnings were $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. As discussed in the Income Statement Commentary below, fiscal 2005 results were affected by the following: integration costs of $4.8 million ($3 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the BOC acquisition; and a separation package for the Companys former President Chief Operating Officer of $1.6 million ($1 million after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share. Fiscal 2004 results were affected by the following: insurance related losses of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, representing the Companys self insurance retention associated with fire related losses; a $1.7 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, non recurring insurance gain recognized by National Welders; and a special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. During fiscal 2005, the Company completed 16 acquisitions (including two businesses acquired by National Welders) with combined annual sales of approximately $260 million. The largest of the acquisitions was that of the U.S. packaged gas business of BOC, which closed on July 30, 2004. The Company acquired the BOC assets for approximately $175 million cash, plus up to $25 million to be paid on or about November 15, 2005. The $25 million contingent portion of the purchase price is based on the Company achieving certain financial targets. The transaction was financed through borrowings on the Companys U.S. revolving credit facility. The acquired business generated approximately $240 million in revenue in its fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. The acquired operations have been predominately included in the Distribution segment. The Company had strong same store sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2005. The Company believes that it is in the middle of a traditional economic recovery cycle in which gas supply has tightened and cylinder gas volumes are growing. Fiscal 2005 same store sales growth benefited from continued success of the Companys strategic product sales initiatives related to medical, bulk, specialty gases and 16 Table of Contents safety products. Sales of hardgoods were especially strong during the year with significant gains related to safety products and traditional welding products, such as welding wire, rods, torches and other welding accessories. During the third fiscal quarter and into the fourth quarter, the Company experienced pressure on gross profit margins and rising operating expenses. These cost pressures factored into the Companys decision to raise prices on a number of its product lines in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, with respect to its joint venture with National Welders and consolidated this formerly unconsolidated affiliate. Beginning January 1, 2004 and for the year ended March 31, 2005, National Welders operating results were reflected broadly across the income statement in the All Other Operations business segment with minority interest expense representing the preferred stockholders proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings were reflected as Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, National Welders contributed $39 million to sales, $3 million to operating income, and $452 thousand of minority interest expense. In fiscal 2005, National Welders was consolidated for the full 12 month period and contributed $167 million to sales, $16 million to operating income, and $1.8 million of minority interest expense. Net earnings were not impacted by the consolidation of National Welders. During fiscal 2005, the Company also completed its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (the Act). Compliance with the Act and the preparation for the newly required assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, required the allocation of a significant level of internal resources. However, compliance with the Act did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. The Companys report on internal control and the associated report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Looking forward, the Company anticipates that fiscal 2006 will be another productive year with new challenges and opportunities. The Company anticipates further expansion of the industrial economy during fiscal 2006 and estimates that fiscal 2006 net earnings will be approximately $1.43 to $1.50 per diluted share. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company estimates that it will earn $0.33 to $0.36 per diluted share. The estimate of fiscal 2006 net earnings anticipates a supportive sales environment and continued success of pricing actions designed to offset rising costs. Actual fiscal 2006 net earnings may be impacted by a number of factors including continued improvement in the industrial economy, customer acceptance of price increases, the sales mix of gas and rent versus hardgoods, and the interest rate environment, among other factors. Acquisitions in fiscal 2006 could also continue to be an important component of the Companys growth. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed the acquisitions of the Industrial Products Division of LaRoche Industries, a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $65 million, and Kanox, Inc., a Kansas based distributor of packaged gases and related hardgoods with annual sales of approximately $23 million. The Company also remains focused on integrating BOCs packaged gas business into the Companys distribution network, which is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2006. In addition, the Company set certain long term financial goals for fiscal 2008, including achieving annual sales of $3 billion and operating margins of 10% 11% of sales. 17 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 27% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 driven primarily by acquisitions, strong same store sales growth of 9% and the consolidation of National Welders. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 2,078,739 $ 1,702,471 $ 376,268 22 % All Other Operations 385,611 235,926 149,685 63 % Intercompany eliminations (52,941 ) (42,929 ) (10,012 ) $ 2,411,409 $ 1,895,468 $ 515,941 27 % The Distribution segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases; process chemicals; equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases and process chemicals are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies. Distribution segment sales increased $376 million (22%) compared to the prior year driven by acquisitions (principally the BOC acquisition) and growth in same store sales. The BOC acquisition and other smaller acquisitions contributed estimated incremental sales of $192 million in fiscal 2005. Distribution same store sales growth of $184 million (10%) resulted from hardgoods sales gains of $125 million (14%) and gas and rent sales growth of $59 million (6%). Hardgoods sales growth resulted from price and volume gains consistent with the solid industrial recovery across many of the markets served by the Company. For example, same store sales of welding wire and welding accessories (e.g. welding machines, torches) increased by approximately $40 million and $25 million, respectively. The costs of welding wire and accessories were significantly impacted by rising steel prices in fiscal 2005. The Company successfully passed through the higher costs to its customers. Same store sales of safety products increased approximately $40 million and were positively impacted by the Companys strategy of cross selling safety products to its broad base of customers. Radnor private label sales growth of 36% was also indicative of the success of the Companys branch store core stocking program. The Companys core stocking program ensures that each branch store is stocked with the most commonly demanded hardgoods products. The Company follows a strategy that focuses on products and markets that are expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy. These products include medical and specialty gases, gases sold in bulk and micro bulk containers, safety products, and sales to strategic account customers (large customers with multiple locations). Fiscal 2005 gas and rent same store sales growth was driven by these products as well as the strengthened industrial economy. Medical gas and rent sales grew 5% to $169 million in fiscal 2005 driven by the strength of the Airgas Puritan Medical business model, which includes a far reaching network of locations, superior customer service and innovative programs, such as the Walk O2 Bout medical cylinder program utilized by hospitals and the home healthcare market. Same store sales of specialty gases increased 4% to $157 million in fiscal 2005. Bulk gas and rent revenues grew 10% to over $120 million reflecting higher volumes. Sales to strategic account customers also contributed to the growth in gas, rent and hardgoods same store sales. Growth in industrial gases (e.g. acetylene, helium, argon) were also solid contributors. Rental revenue was also favorably impacted by a 7% increase in welding equipment rentals and sales associated with the Companys rental welder fleet. 18 Table of Contents The All Other Operations segment consists of producers and distributors of gas products, principally of dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. The segment also includes the Companys National Welders joint venture, which was consolidated effective December 31, 2003. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany sales eliminations, increased $140 million, principally from the consolidation of National Welders and same store sales growth. National Welders contributed sales of $167 million in fiscal 2005 versus $39 million in the prior year (fourth quarter only). Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, it would have contributed sales of $147 million. Same store sales growth was principally the result of higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice and industrial gas volume gains at National Welders. Dry ice sales volume gains were dampened by pricing pressure in this competitive market. Gross Profits Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. As disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company reflects distribution costs as elements of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment on the income statement line item Depreciation. Some companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their Cost of Products Sold. Consequently, gross profits discussed below may not be comparable to those of other entities. Gross profits increased 25% resulting from higher sales volumes generated by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the consolidation of National Welders. Although the gross profit dollars were higher, the gross profit margin decreased 100 basis points to 51.1% in fiscal 2005 compared to 52.1% in fiscal 2004. The decline in the gross profit margin was partially due to lower gas margins experienced during the second half of fiscal 2005 resulting from lower margins of the acquired BOC business and higher sales of lower margin bulk gases. The pressure on margins factored into the Companys decision to raise prices on a number of its product lines in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Related to hardgoods products, the entire industry has been impacted by the rapidly rising price of steel, a primary component of welding wire and rods. However, the gross profit margin on hardgoods was relatively consistent with the prior year as the product cost increases were effectively passed through to customers. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 1,021,192 $ 857,031 $ 164,161 19 % All Other Operations 211,172 129,756 81,416 63 % $ 1,232,364 $ 986,787 $ 245,577 25 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $164 million (19%) compared to the prior year driven by acquisitions and same store sales growth. The Distribution segments gross profit margin of 49.1% in fiscal 2005 decreased 120 basis points from 50.3% in fiscal 2004. The lower gross profit margin resulted from the higher same store sales growth rates for hardgoods versus gas and rent sales. Hardgoods carry a lower gross profit margin versus gas and rent sales and helped drive the decline in the gross profit margin. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 50.8% gas and rent compared to 51.8% in fiscal 2004. The gross profit margin was also impacted by lower margins from the acquired BOC business and higher sales of lower margin bulk gases. Higher cylinder maintenance and freight in costs associated with sales growth also contributed to the lower gross profit margin. The Company anticipates that the gross profit margin will rise in fiscal 2006 reflecting the full impact of the price increases as well as continued gas volume growth. All Other Operations gross profits increased $81 million (63%) compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the consolidation of National Welders. National Welders contributed $70 million to the increase in gross profits. The remainder of the increase in gross profits reflects higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice. The All Other Operations gross profit margin was relatively consistent compared to the prior year. 19 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SDA) consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. SDA expenses increased $186 million (25%) compared to the prior year principally from the consolidation of National Welders and costs contributed by acquisitions. A full year of expenses related to National Welders contributed $65 million in SDA expenses versus $16 million for the fourth quarter in the prior year. Acquisitions contributed an estimated $86 million in SDA expenses. The remainder of the increase resulted from higher labor, utility and distribution related expenses. Labor and utility expense increases reflected costs to fill cylinders and operate facilities to meet increased demand for products. The increase in distribution related expenses of approximately $8 million was primarily driven by higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was directly related to higher oil prices during fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 also included costs of $4.8 million associated with the integration of the BOC business into the Companys operations and $1.6 million for a separation package for the former Chief Operating Officer. Acquisition integration expenses were not significant during fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, the Company sustained fire related losses of $2.8 million at certain of its plants. As a percentage of sales, SDA expenses decreased 50 basis points to 38.1% versus 38.6% in the prior year driven by higher sales volumes and improving cost leverage. Depreciation expense of $106 million in fiscal 2005 increased $23 million (28%) compared to $83 million in fiscal 2004. National Welders contributed $9 million in additional depreciation expense and acquisitions contributed approximately $8 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the current and prior years capital investments in revenue producing assets, including medical cylinders and bulk tanks. The Companys lease buyout program to purchase long lived assets subject to high cost leases also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense in fiscal 2005. Amortization expense in fiscal 2005 of $5.5 million was consistent with the prior year. Operating Income Operating income increased 21% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 driven by higher sales and the consolidation of National Welders. The operating income margin decreased 50 basis points to 8.4% from 8.9% in the prior year. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 158,018 $ 136,449 $ 21,569 16 % All Other Operations 45,215 31,331 13,884 44 % $ 203,233 $ 167,780 $ 35,453 21 % The Distribution segments operating income margin of 7.6% in fiscal 2005 decreased 40 basis points compared to 8.0% in the prior year. BOC integration costs and the separation package for the Companys former Chief Operating Officer contributed 30 basis points to the decline in the operating income margin. The decrease in the operating income margin also reflected the lower gross profit margin, described above. The All Other Operations segments operating income margin decreased 160 basis points to 11.7% from 13.3% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the operating income margin primarily resulted from the consolidation of National Welders, which carries a lower operating income margin compared to the other businesses in the All Other Operations segment. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the comparable operating income margin would have been 11.5%. 20 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $56 million representing an increase of $10 million (22%) compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense primarily resulted from higher debt levels associated with acquisitions, principally the BOC acquisition. The increase in interest expense was also driven by higher weighted average interest rates. The consolidation of National Welders contributed $2 million to the increase in interest expense. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $190 million and $163 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates at March 31, 2005 was 61% fixed to 39% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Based on the Companys outstanding variable rate debt and credit rating at March 31, 2005, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates its annual interest expense would increase approximately $1 million. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 36.8% of pre tax earnings in fiscal 2005 compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2004. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2005 resulted from changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the realization of federal and state tax credits. Minority Interest and Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate In fiscal 2005, the Company modified its presentation of minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to improve the presentation of the relationship between earnings before taxes and income tax expense. The new presentation reflects both the minority interest related to National Welders and the equity income recognized in prior periods related to National Welders, net of tax, below income tax expense. The Company also reclassified earnings of its partnership interest in AC Industries from equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to other income (expense). The reclassifications have been reflected in all prior periods to conform with the new presentation. Minority interest expense represents the portion of National Welders earnings applicable to the preferred stockholders of National Welders. Minority interest expense in fiscal 2005 represents a full year of expense versus one quarter in fiscal 2004, reflecting the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in fiscal 2004 of $4.4 million represents the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings through the date of consolidation. National Welders earnings included a $1.7 million after tax life insurance gain in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. Prior to the date that the Company entered into the joint venture agreement with National Welders, the founders of National Welders had obtained life insurance policies on key personnel in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. 21 Table of Contents Net Earnings Net earnings in fiscal 2005 were $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. The weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per diluted share increased by 2.3 million shares in fiscal 2005. The increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding primarily related to stock option exercises and shares purchased by employees under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plans. The Company expects that the weighted average number of shares outstanding will continue to increase by 2% to 3% per year. 22 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 OVERVIEW The Companys net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004) were $1.90 billion compared to $1.79 billion in the prior year (fiscal 2003). Sales growth of $109 million was driven by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. During fiscal 2004, the Company completed five acquisitions with combined annual sales of approximately $59 million. Strategic product sales initiatives related to medical, bulk and specialty gases, and strategic accounts, contributed to a 1% increase in total same store sales. Sales growth was achieved despite weakness in the manufacturing and industrial markets during much of fiscal 2004. While same store sales were flat through the first nine months of fiscal 2004, they began rebounding in the fourth quarter led by sales of hardgoods, which increased significantly (9%) as the industrial marketplace began to show signs of an economic recovery. Gas and rent sales also showed improvement (2%) in the fiscal fourth quarter. Fiscal 2004 net earnings were $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. As discussed in the Income Statement Commentary below, fiscal 2004 results were affected by the following: insurance related losses of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, representing the Companys self insurance retention associated with fire related losses; a $1.7 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, non recurring insurance gain recognized by National Welders; and a special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. Fiscal 2003 results were affected by the following: special and other charges totaling $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, primarily consisting of a restructuring charge ($2.7 million) related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) in fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. At December 31, 2003, the Company elected to adopt FIN 46R with respect to its joint venture with National Welders and consolidated this formerly unconsolidated affiliate. Since June 1996, the Company has participated in the joint venture and has used the equity method of accounting to report the Companys proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. Consequently, the consolidation of National Welders had no impact on the net earnings of the Company. In addition, the consolidation did not change the fact that the liabilities of the joint venture are non recourse to the Company and the cash flows, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders, are not available to the Company. Through the nine months ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized $4.4 million of Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate related to National Welders. With the prospective adoption permitted by FIN 46R (prior periods not restated), the fourth fiscal quarter operating results of the joint venture were reflected broadly across the income statement with minority interest expense reflecting the preferred stockholders proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, National Welders contributed $39 million to sales, $3 million to operating income, $452 thousand of minority interest expense and $1 million in net earnings. 23 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 6% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 driven primarily by acquisitions, same store sales growth of 1% and the consolidation of National Welders. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 1,702,471 $ 1,642,076 $ 60,395 4 % All Other Operations 235,926 183,849 52,077 28 % Intercompany eliminations (42,929 ) (38,961 ) (3,968 ) $ 1,895,468 $ 1,786,964 $ 108,504 6 % Distribution segment sales increased $60 million (4%) driven by acquisitions and growth in same store sales. The Company estimates that business acquisitions contributed $39 million to sales in fiscal 2004. Same store sales growth of $21 million (1%) resulted from increases in hardgoods sales of $13 million (1%) and gas and rent sales of $8 million (1%). Through the first nine months of fiscal 2004, Distribution same store sales were negative, driven by lower sales of hardgoods reflecting weakness in the industrial and manufacturing sectors of the economy. However, same store sales of hardgoods increased significantly (9%) in the fiscal fourth quarter as the industrial marketplace began to show signs of an economic recovery. Gas and rent sales also showed improvement (2%) in the fiscal fourth quarter. Same store sales of safety products increased a strong 6% during fiscal 2004 as the Company continued its cross selling strategy of marketing safety products to its broad base of customers. During fiscal 2004, strategic product sales initiatives contributed to sales growth of gas and rent, which helped mitigate weakness in the industrial economy. Medical gas and rent revenues increased 8% to $146 million versus the prior year reflecting volume gains. Sales growth of specialty gases fell short of expectations, driven by pricing pressure and sluggish demand associated with economic conditions. Bulk gas and rent revenues grew 8% to $107 million reflecting higher volumes as well as the promotion of the Companys micro bulk program. The micro bulk program is designed to service niche customers who require higher volumes of gases than can be provided efficiently through the use of gases packaged in cylinders. Sales to strategic account customers (sales to large customers with multiple locations) increased 3% to $255 million in fiscal 2004. Rental revenue was also favorably impacted by a 7% increase in welding equipment rentals and sales associated with the Companys continued expansion of its rental welder fleet. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany sales eliminations, increased $48 million (33%), principally from the consolidation of National Welders, same store sales growth and an acquisition during fiscal 2004. National Welders contributed sales of $39 million in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, it would have contributed sales of $147 million. Same store sales growth of 5% was principally the result of higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide reflecting the additional source of product from the Hopewell, Virginia plant that began operations in January 2003. Same store sales growth associated with liquid carbon dioxide was partially offset by lower sales of dry ice. Sales of dry ice were negatively impacted during fiscal 2004 by significant pricing pressure related to additional competition in the market. The acquisition of a dry ice business in April 2003 also contributed sales of $2 million in fiscal 2004. 24 Table of Contents Gross Profits Gross profits increased 5%, while the gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points to 52.1% in fiscal 2004 compared to 52.4% in fiscal 2003. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 857,031 $ 835,756 $ 21,275 3 % All Other Operations 129,756 100,892 28,864 29 % $ 986,787 $ 936,648 $ 50,139 5 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $21 million (3%) compared to the prior year. Distributions gross profit margin of 50.3% in fiscal 2004 decreased 60 basis points from 50.9% in fiscal 2003. The lower gross profit margin primarily resulted from a shift in sales mix away from higher margin gas and rent sales and towards lower margin sales of hardgoods. Acquisitions of two distributors of safety products also contributed to the shift in mix. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 51.8% gas and rent compared to 52.6% in fiscal 2003. All Other Operations gross profits increased $29 million (29%) compared to the prior year. Higher gross profits primarily reflect the consolidation of National Welders, higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide sourced from the new Hopewell, Virginia plant and an acquisition. The consolidation of National Welders contributed gross profits of $22 million. The gross profit margin of 55% was flat compared to 54.9% in the prior year. The fourth quarter consolidation of National Welders had an insignificant impact on the gross profit margin. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the impact on the All Other Operations segments gross profit margin would also not have been significant. Operating Expenses SDA expenses increased $34 million (5%) compared to the prior year principally from the consolidation of National Welders, higher distribution related expenses, costs contributed by acquired businesses and fire related losses. The consolidation of National Welders contributed $16 million to the increase in SDA expenses. The increase in distribution related expenses of approximately $5 million was primarily driven by higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the increase in oil prices during fiscal 2004. Acquired businesses contributed approximately $13 million to the increase in SDA expenses. During fiscal 2004, the Company sustained fire related losses at certain of its plants of $2.8 million, which represented the Companys self insurance retention. The prior year included costs of $2.7 million associated with the integration of the packaged gas business acquired from Air Products in February 2002. Acquisition integration expenses were not significant during fiscal 2004. As a percentage of net sales, SDA expenses decreased 50 basis points to 38.6% compared to 39.1% in the prior year. Depreciation expense of $83 million in fiscal 2004 increased $9 million (12%) compared to $74 million in fiscal 2003. The increase reflects depreciation on the current and prior years capital investments in revenue producing assets, including the Hopewell carbon dioxide plant, bulk and micro bulk tanks and medical cylinders. The fourth quarter consolidation of National Welders also contributed approximately $3 million to the increase in depreciation expense. Amortization expense of $5.4 million in fiscal 2004 decreased $1 million compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in amortization expense was primarily attributable to the expiration of certain non compete agreements. 25 Table of Contents Special Charges (Recoveries) In fiscal 2004, a special charge recovery of $776 thousand consisted of lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring charges. The special charge recovery was included in the Distribution segment and represented a change in estimate related to facility exit costs. In fiscal 2003, the Company recognized a special charge of $2.7 million related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. The special charge included facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain facilities and employee severance. The facilities exited and the affected employees were part of the Companys existing operations prior to the acquisition of the Air Products business. Operating Income Operating income increased 8% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The operating income margin increased 20 basis points to 8.9% from 8.7% in the prior year. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 136,449 $ 130,534 $ 5,915 5 % All Other Operations 31,331 25,348 5,983 24 % $ 167,780 $ 155,882 $ 11,898 8 % The Distribution segments operating income margin of 8% in fiscal 2004 was consistent with 7.9% in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2004 operating income margin reflects the lower gross profit margin, described above, effectively offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. The All Other Operations segments operating income margin decreased 50 basis points to 13.3% compared to 13.8% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the operating income margin primarily resulted from higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales driven by the consolidation of National Welders. National Welders has a higher cost structure compared to the other businesses included in the segment. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the operating income margin would have been 11.5%. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled approximately $46 million representing a decrease of $4 million ( 8%) compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in interest expense resulted from lower average outstanding debt levels and lower weighted average interest rates associated with the Companys variable rate debt. The Companys interest expense and average outstanding debt levels were lower despite the July 1, 2003 consolidation of a grantor trust associated with an operating lease and the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $163 million and $159 million at March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates at March 31, 2004 was 57% fixed to 43% variable. 26 Table of Contents Minority Interest and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate Minority interest expense represents the portion of National Welders earnings applicable to the preferred stockholders of National Welders. Minority interest expense in fiscal 2004 represents one quarter of expense as a result of the December 31, 2003 consolidation. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in fiscal 2004 of $4.4 million represents the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings through the date of consolidation. The increase in fiscal 2004 equity earnings compared to fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from a $1.7 million after tax life insurance gain in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.3% of pre tax earnings in fiscal 2004 compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2003. Net Earnings Net earnings in fiscal 2004 were $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. 27 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2005 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $222 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $211 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2005 operating cash flows resulted from higher net earnings adjusted for non cash items and cash provided by the trade receivables securitization, partially offset by an increase in cash used by working capital. Net earnings adjusted for non cash items provided cash of $246 million versus $194 million in fiscal 2004. Working capital used cash of $52 million in 2005 versus providing cash of $13 million in 2004. Working capital components used cash in fiscal 2005 reflecting higher levels of hardgoods inventory and trade receivables in connection with overall sales growth. The Company increased the level of receivables sold under its trade receivables securitization program generating incremental cash compared to 2004 of $24 million. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 were primarily used to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. Cash from operations in fiscal 2005 includes $20 million of cash provided by National Welders compared to $10 million associated with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The cash flows of National Welders, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders to the Company, are not available to the Company. Prior to the fourth quarter 2004 consolidation of National Welders, the management fee paid by National Welders to the Company was reflected as an investing activity as fees from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash used in investing activities totaled $353 million and primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions of $192 million and capital expenditures of $168 million. Acquisitions in fiscal 2005 primarily consisted of $175 million paid for the BOC acquisition. Capital expenditures were $74 million higher than in fiscal 2004 driven by spending for cylinders and bulk tanks reflecting continued investment to support the Companys strategic sales initiatives, such as those related to medical and bulk gases. In addition, fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included $35 million ($11 million at National Welders) of real estate and tube trailer lease buyouts under a program to purchase long lived assets that were subject to high cost operating leases. For fiscal 2006, the Company estimates that capital spending will approximate 5% of sales. Financing activities provided cash of $139 million primarily from borrowings, which were raised to fund the BOC acquisition. Financing activities also included proceeds of $20 million received from the exercise of stock options. Dividends paid to stockholders during fiscal 2005 used cash of $14 million. Beginning with this annual report on Form 10 K, the Company has changed from a net cash presentation on the balance sheet to a gross presentation. Previously, the Company did not show cash balances as all depository cash and cash overdrafts were combined and the net overdraft was recorded in other current liabilities. In the current presentation, depository cash and cash overdrafts are presented on a gross basis. The Company has adopted the current presentation as it is consistent with the practice among most companies and is also more transparent. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The Company will continue to look for acquisitions to complement its existing businesses and improve its geographic coverage. Capital expenditures, current debt maturities and any future acquisitions will be funded through the use of cash flow from operations, revolving credit facilities, and other financing alternatives. The Company believes that its sources of financing are adequate for its anticipated needs and that it could arrange additional sources of financing for unanticipated requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangement depend on the market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time. 28 Table of Contents Dividends At the end of each quarter during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.045 and $0.040 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 24, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share, representing a 33% increase compared to the prior year quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable June 30, 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2005. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Instruments Senior Credit Agreement On January 14, 2005, the Company amended and restated its senior credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) to extend the maturity date from July 30, 2006 to January 14, 2010 and to provide the Company with more flexibility to invest in growth and or return cash to stockholders. Accordingly, the Credit Agreement significantly reduces the limitations on acquisitions, restricted payments and debt incurrence. The Credit Agreement also allows for the expansion of the Companys trade receivables securitization up to a maximum of $300 million in trade receivables. The Credit Agreement continues to require that the Company maintain certain leverage and coverage ratios. As provided for in the Credit Agreement, the computations of the restrictive covenants include pro forma results of acquired businesses. As such, the amount borrowed to finance an acquisition does not reduce the Companys borrowing capacity by a similar amount. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company has unsecured senior credit facilities that provide revolving credit lines of $308 million and Canadian $50 million and a term loan. As of March 31, 2005, the Company had revolving credit borrowings of approximately $136 million, Canadian $27 million (U.S. $22 million), and term loan borrowings of $96 million. The Company also had commitments under letters of credit of $33 million supported by the Credit Agreement at March 31, 2005. After considering the covenant limitations, as of March 31, 2005, the effective additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was approximately U.S. $159 million. The U.S. dollar borrowings bear interest of LIBOR plus 95 basis points and the Canadian dollar borrowings bear interest at the Canadian Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 95 basis points. As of March 31, 2005, the effective interest rate on the U.S. dollar revolving credit lines, the Canadian dollar credit lines and the U.S. dollar term loan were 3.74%, 4.67% and 4.04%, respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, the Companys domestic subsidiaries guarantee the U.S. borrowings and Canadian borrowings, and the Companys foreign subsidiaries also guarantee the Canadian borrowings. The guarantees are full and unconditional and are made on a joint and several basis. The Company has pledged 100% of the stock of its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries as surety for its obligations under the agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for the release of the guarantees and collateral if the Company attains an investment grade credit rating and maintains such rating for two consecutive quarters. 29 Table of Contents Medium Term Notes At March 31, 2005, the Company had $100 million of medium term notes due September 2006 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%. The medium term notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities. The Company has pledged the stock of its domestic guarantors for the benefit of the note holders. Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long term debt also included acquisition and other notes principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2005, acquisition and other notes totaled approximately $10 million with interest rates ranging from 4% to 9%. Senior Subordinated Notes At March 31, 2005, the Company had $150 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2004 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of July 15, 2014. The 2004 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2004 notes have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2004 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is July 15, 2009 at a price of 103.1% of the principal amount. In addition to the 2004 Notes, at March 31, 2005, the Company had $225 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2001 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of October 1, 2011. The 2001 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.125%, payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2001 notes also have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2001 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is October 1, 2006 at a price of 104.6% of the principal amount. The 2004 Notes and 2001 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The 2004 Notes and 2001 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities. The stock of the Companys domestic subsidiaries is also pledged to the note holders on a subordinated basis. Financial Instruments of the National Welders Joint Venture Pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46R, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2005 and 2004 include the financial obligations of National Welders. National Welders financial obligations are non recourse to the Company, meaning that the creditors of National Welders do not have a claim on the assets of Airgas, Inc. National Welders has a credit agreement (the NWS Credit Agreement) that provides for available credit up to $100 million secured by certain assets. The NWS Credit Agreement provides for a Term Loan A of $26 million, a Term Loan B of $21 million, a Term Loan C of $9 million, and a revolving credit line of $44 million. Term Loan A is repayable in monthly amounts of $254 thousand with a lump sum payment of the outstanding balance at maturity in June 2007. Term Loan B (See subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) matures in July 2006 and Term Loan C matures in 30 Table of Contents September 2006. The revolving credit line matures in June 2007. The NWS Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, limit the ability of National Welders to incur and guarantee new indebtedness, subject National Welders to minimum net worth requirements, and limit its capital expenditures, ownership changes, merger and acquisition activity, and the payment of dividends. At March 31, 2005, National Welders had borrowings under its revolving credit line of $22 million, under Term Loan A of $18 million, under Term Loan B of $21 million, and under Term C of $3.5 million. Interest rates on Term Loans A, B and the revolving credit line are variable and range from LIBOR plus 150 to 225 basis points based on National Welders leverage ratio. At March 31, 2005, the effective interest rate for Term Loans A, B and the revolving credit line was 4.85%. Term Loan C bears a fixed interest rate of 7%. Based on restrictions related to certain leverage ratios, National Welders had additional borrowing capacity under its NWS Credit Agreement of approximately $22 million at March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2005, Term Loan A and the revolving credit line are secured by certain current assets, principally trade receivables and inventory, totaling $30 million, non current assets, principally equipment, totaling $71 million, and Airgas common stock with a market value of $22 million classified as treasury stock and carried at cost of $370 thousand. Term Loan B is secured by a $21 million note receivable from the preferred stockholders of National Welders (See Subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In consolidation, the note receivable is presented as a reduction to the minority interest liability. Term Loan C is secured by a production facility, which had a net book value of approximately $14 million at March 31, 2005. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company and National Welders manage exposure to changes in market interest rates. At March 31, 2005, the Company was party to a total of four interest rate swap agreements. The swap agreements are with major financial institutions and aggregate $100 million in notional principal amount. These swap agreements require the Company to make fixed interest payments based on an average effective rate of 3.59% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on one month and three month LIBOR (average rate of 2.73% at March 31, 2005). The remaining terms of these swap agreements range from between seven months and four years. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties. On March 30, 2005, the Company terminated four variable interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of $125 million. The interest rate swap agreements previously converted a corresponding amount of fixed rate medium term notes and the senior subordinated notes due 2011 to variable rate debt. As a result of swap termination, the Company received $3.9 million in cash. The corresponding gain on the termination has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the notes. National Welders participates in one interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of $21 million on which it makes interest payments based on a fixed rate of 6.72% and receives variable interest payments from its counterparty based on a floating 30 day LIBOR rate of 2.85% at March 31, 2005 (See subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates was approximately 61% fixed to 39% variable at March 31, 2005. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the LIBOR. Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio at March 31, 2005, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $1 million. 31 Table of Contents Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in February 2008, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. During fiscal 2005, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $2,204 million of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $2,177 million in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $190 million at March 31, 2005 and $163 million at March 31, 2004. The transaction has been accounted for as a sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Under the securitization agreement, eligible trade receivables are sold to bank conduits through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying value of the receivables is recognized as Discount on securitization of trade receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings and varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. The Company retains a subordinated interest in the receivables sold, which is recorded at the receivables previous carrying value. A subordinated retained interest of approximately $57 million and $44 million is included in Trade receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys retained interest is generally collected within 60 days. On a monthly basis, management measures the fair value of the retained interest at managements best estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the transferred receivables. Changes in the fair value are recognized as bad debt expense. Actual cash collections may differ from these estimates and would directly affect the fair value of the retained interest. In accordance with a servicing agreement, the Company continues to service, administer and collect the trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits approximate the costs of collections. Debt of Grantor Trust In October 2004, the Company used funds from its revolving credit facilities to refinance its $41 million debt obligation under a sale leaseback arrangement with a grantor trust. Since the Company had previously consolidated the grantor trust in July 2003 in accordance with the adoption of FIN 46, there was no net change in the Companys outstanding debt as a result of the maturity of the sale leaseback arrangement. Employee Benefits Trust Since March 1999, the Company has maintained an Employee Benefits Trust (the Trust) to fund certain future obligations of the Companys employee benefit and compensation plans. From inception through 2001, the Company, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, sold approximately 7 million shares of common stock, previously held as treasury stock, to the Trust. The Company holds promissory notes from the Trust in the amount of common stock purchased by the trust. Shares held by the Trust serve as collateral for the promissory notes and are available to fund certain employee benefit plan obligations as the promissory notes are repaid. The shares held by the Employee Benefits Trust are not considered outstanding for earnings per share purposes until they are released from serving as collateral for the promissory notes. Approximately 1.9 million and 1.2 million shares were issued from the Employee Benefits Trust for employee benefit programs during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of March 31, 2005, the Employee Benefits Trust held 338 thousand shares of Company common stock. The remaining shares were issued from the Trust during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for employee stock option exercises. 32 Table of Contents Inflation While the U.S. inflation rate has been relatively modest for several years, rising costs continue to affect the Companys business. The Company strives to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment and price increases under highly competitive conditions. OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2003 include special and other charges of $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax) primarily consisting of a restructuring charge ($2.7 million) related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. (4) The results for fiscal 2002 include: (a) a non cash after tax charge of $59 million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), (b) a litigation settlement charge of $8.5 million ($5.7 million after tax), and (c) a net non recurring gain of $1.9 million ($120 thousand after tax) related to divestitures and a write down of a business held for sale to its net realizable value. (5) The results for fiscal 2001 include: (a) net special charges of $3.6 million ($2.3 million after tax), (b) litigation charges, net, of $5.8 million ($3.6 million after tax), and (c) asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates of $700 thousand after tax. Depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2001 reflects amortization of goodwill. Effective April 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and for years subsequent to fiscal 2001, goodwill was no longer amortized, rather it was tested for impairment. (6) At the end of each quarter during fiscal 2005 and 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.045 and $0.04 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 24, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable June 30, 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2005. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. 14 Table of Contents (7) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications include the presentation of depository cash, cash overdrafts, minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company has changed from a net cash presentation on the balance sheet to a gross presentation. Previously, the Company did not show cash balances as all depository cash and cash overdrafts were combined and the net overdraft was recorded in other current liabilities. In the current presentation, depository cash and cash overdrafts are presented on a gross basis. Accordingly, the Statement of Cash Flows for each year presented also reflects the change in presentation and reconciles to the change in cash on the balance sheet. The Company has adopted the current presentation as it is consistent with practice among most companies and is more transparent. Minority interest and equity earnings recognized in prior periods related to the Companys joint venture affiliate, National Welders, were reclassified from elements of earnings before income taxes to be presented net of tax below income tax expense. 15 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Item 7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 OVERVIEW The Companys net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005) were $2.41 billion compared to $1.90 billion in the prior year (fiscal 2004). Sales growth of $516 million was driven by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the consolidation of National Welders, a joint venture affiliate of the Company. The Company estimates that acquisitions contributed sales of approximately $197 million during fiscal 2005, the largest of which was the acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. (BOC). Same store sales growth of 9% contributed sales of approximately $191 million reflecting the rebounding economy and strength in industrial markets served by the Company. The consolidation of National Welders, effective December 31, 2003 (fiscal 2004), contributed incremental sales of $128 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 net earnings were $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. As discussed in the Income Statement Commentary below, fiscal 2005 results were affected by the following: integration costs of $4.8 million ($3 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the BOC acquisition; and a separation package for the Companys former President Chief Operating Officer of $1.6 million ($1 million after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share. Fiscal 2004 results were affected by the following: insurance related losses of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, representing the Companys self insurance retention associated with fire related losses; a $1.7 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, non recurring insurance gain recognized by National Welders; and a special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. During fiscal 2005, the Company completed 16 acquisitions (including two businesses acquired by National Welders) with combined annual sales of approximately $260 million. The largest of the acquisitions was that of the U.S. packaged gas business of BOC, which closed on July 30, 2004. The Company acquired the BOC assets for approximately $175 million cash, plus up to $25 million to be paid on or about November 15, 2005. The $25 million contingent portion of the purchase price is based on the Company achieving certain financial targets. The transaction was financed through borrowings on the Companys U.S. revolving credit facility. The acquired business generated approximately $240 million in revenue in its fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. The acquired operations have been predominately included in the Distribution segment. The Company had strong same store sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2005. The Company believes that it is in the middle of a traditional economic recovery cycle in which gas supply has tightened and cylinder gas volumes are growing. Fiscal 2005 same store sales growth benefited from continued success of the Companys strategic product sales initiatives related to medical, bulk, specialty gases and 16 Table of Contents safety products. Sales of hardgoods were especially strong during the year with significant gains related to safety products and traditional welding products, such as welding wire, rods, torches and other welding accessories. During the third fiscal quarter and into the fourth quarter, the Company experienced pressure on gross profit margins and rising operating expenses. These cost pressures factored into the Companys decision to raise prices on a number of its product lines in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, with respect to its joint venture with National Welders and consolidated this formerly unconsolidated affiliate. Beginning January 1, 2004 and for the year ended March 31, 2005, National Welders operating results were reflected broadly across the income statement in the All Other Operations business segment with minority interest expense representing the preferred stockholders proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings were reflected as Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, National Welders contributed $39 million to sales, $3 million to operating income, and $452 thousand of minority interest expense. In fiscal 2005, National Welders was consolidated for the full 12 month period and contributed $167 million to sales, $16 million to operating income, and $1.8 million of minority interest expense. Net earnings were not impacted by the consolidation of National Welders. During fiscal 2005, the Company also completed its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (the Act). Compliance with the Act and the preparation for the newly required assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, required the allocation of a significant level of internal resources. However, compliance with the Act did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. The Companys report on internal control and the associated report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Looking forward, the Company anticipates that fiscal 2006 will be another productive year with new challenges and opportunities. The Company anticipates further expansion of the industrial economy during fiscal 2006 and estimates that fiscal 2006 net earnings will be approximately $1.43 to $1.50 per diluted share. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company estimates that it will earn $0.33 to $0.36 per diluted share. The estimate of fiscal 2006 net earnings anticipates a supportive sales environment and continued success of pricing actions designed to offset rising costs. Actual fiscal 2006 net earnings may be impacted by a number of factors including continued improvement in the industrial economy, customer acceptance of price increases, the sales mix of gas and rent versus hardgoods, and the interest rate environment, among other factors. Acquisitions in fiscal 2006 could also continue to be an important component of the Companys growth. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed the acquisitions of the Industrial Products Division of LaRoche Industries, a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $65 million, and Kanox, Inc., a Kansas based distributor of packaged gases and related hardgoods with annual sales of approximately $23 million. The Company also remains focused on integrating BOCs packaged gas business into the Companys distribution network, which is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2006. In addition, the Company set certain long term financial goals for fiscal 2008, including achieving annual sales of $3 billion and operating margins of 10% 11% of sales. 17 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 27% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 driven primarily by acquisitions, strong same store sales growth of 9% and the consolidation of National Welders. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 2,078,739 $ 1,702,471 $ 376,268 22 % All Other Operations 385,611 235,926 149,685 63 % Intercompany eliminations (52,941 ) (42,929 ) (10,012 ) $ 2,411,409 $ 1,895,468 $ 515,941 27 % The Distribution segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases; process chemicals; equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases and process chemicals are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies. Distribution segment sales increased $376 million (22%) compared to the prior year driven by acquisitions (principally the BOC acquisition) and growth in same store sales. The BOC acquisition and other smaller acquisitions contributed estimated incremental sales of $192 million in fiscal 2005. Distribution same store sales growth of $184 million (10%) resulted from hardgoods sales gains of $125 million (14%) and gas and rent sales growth of $59 million (6%). Hardgoods sales growth resulted from price and volume gains consistent with the solid industrial recovery across many of the markets served by the Company. For example, same store sales of welding wire and welding accessories (e.g. welding machines, torches) increased by approximately $40 million and $25 million, respectively. The costs of welding wire and accessories were significantly impacted by rising steel prices in fiscal 2005. The Company successfully passed through the higher costs to its customers. Same store sales of safety products increased approximately $40 million and were positively impacted by the Companys strategy of cross selling safety products to its broad base of customers. Radnor private label sales growth of 36% was also indicative of the success of the Companys branch store core stocking program. The Companys core stocking program ensures that each branch store is stocked with the most commonly demanded hardgoods products. The Company follows a strategy that focuses on products and markets that are expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy. These products include medical and specialty gases, gases sold in bulk and micro bulk containers, safety products, and sales to strategic account customers (large customers with multiple locations). Fiscal 2005 gas and rent same store sales growth was driven by these products as well as the strengthened industrial economy. Medical gas and rent sales grew 5% to $169 million in fiscal 2005 driven by the strength of the Airgas Puritan Medical business model, which includes a far reaching network of locations, superior customer service and innovative programs, such as the Walk O2 Bout medical cylinder program utilized by hospitals and the home healthcare market. Same store sales of specialty gases increased 4% to $157 million in fiscal 2005. Bulk gas and rent revenues grew 10% to over $120 million reflecting higher volumes. Sales to strategic account customers also contributed to the growth in gas, rent and hardgoods same store sales. Growth in industrial gases (e.g. acetylene, helium, argon) were also solid contributors. Rental revenue was also favorably impacted by a 7% increase in welding equipment rentals and sales associated with the Companys rental welder fleet. 18 Table of Contents The All Other Operations segment consists of producers and distributors of gas products, principally of dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. The segment also includes the Companys National Welders joint venture, which was consolidated effective December 31, 2003. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany sales eliminations, increased $140 million, principally from the consolidation of National Welders and same store sales growth. National Welders contributed sales of $167 million in fiscal 2005 versus $39 million in the prior year (fourth quarter only). Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, it would have contributed sales of $147 million. Same store sales growth was principally the result of higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice and industrial gas volume gains at National Welders. Dry ice sales volume gains were dampened by pricing pressure in this competitive market. Gross Profits Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. As disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company reflects distribution costs as elements of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment on the income statement line item Depreciation. Some companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their Cost of Products Sold. Consequently, gross profits discussed below may not be comparable to those of other entities. Gross profits increased 25% resulting from higher sales volumes generated by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the consolidation of National Welders. Although the gross profit dollars were higher, the gross profit margin decreased 100 basis points to 51.1% in fiscal 2005 compared to 52.1% in fiscal 2004. The decline in the gross profit margin was partially due to lower gas margins experienced during the second half of fiscal 2005 resulting from lower margins of the acquired BOC business and higher sales of lower margin bulk gases. The pressure on margins factored into the Companys decision to raise prices on a number of its product lines in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Related to hardgoods products, the entire industry has been impacted by the rapidly rising price of steel, a primary component of welding wire and rods. However, the gross profit margin on hardgoods was relatively consistent with the prior year as the product cost increases were effectively passed through to customers. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 1,021,192 $ 857,031 $ 164,161 19 % All Other Operations 211,172 129,756 81,416 63 % $ 1,232,364 $ 986,787 $ 245,577 25 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $164 million (19%) compared to the prior year driven by acquisitions and same store sales growth. The Distribution segments gross profit margin of 49.1% in fiscal 2005 decreased 120 basis points from 50.3% in fiscal 2004. The lower gross profit margin resulted from the higher same store sales growth rates for hardgoods versus gas and rent sales. Hardgoods carry a lower gross profit margin versus gas and rent sales and helped drive the decline in the gross profit margin. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 50.8% gas and rent compared to 51.8% in fiscal 2004. The gross profit margin was also impacted by lower margins from the acquired BOC business and higher sales of lower margin bulk gases. Higher cylinder maintenance and freight in costs associated with sales growth also contributed to the lower gross profit margin. The Company anticipates that the gross profit margin will rise in fiscal 2006 reflecting the full impact of the price increases as well as continued gas volume growth. All Other Operations gross profits increased $81 million (63%) compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the consolidation of National Welders. National Welders contributed $70 million to the increase in gross profits. The remainder of the increase in gross profits reflects higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice. The All Other Operations gross profit margin was relatively consistent compared to the prior year. 19 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SDA) consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. SDA expenses increased $186 million (25%) compared to the prior year principally from the consolidation of National Welders and costs contributed by acquisitions. A full year of expenses related to National Welders contributed $65 million in SDA expenses versus $16 million for the fourth quarter in the prior year. Acquisitions contributed an estimated $86 million in SDA expenses. The remainder of the increase resulted from higher labor, utility and distribution related expenses. Labor and utility expense increases reflected costs to fill cylinders and operate facilities to meet increased demand for products. The increase in distribution related expenses of approximately $8 million was primarily driven by higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was directly related to higher oil prices during fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 also included costs of $4.8 million associated with the integration of the BOC business into the Companys operations and $1.6 million for a separation package for the former Chief Operating Officer. Acquisition integration expenses were not significant during fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, the Company sustained fire related losses of $2.8 million at certain of its plants. As a percentage of sales, SDA expenses decreased 50 basis points to 38.1% versus 38.6% in the prior year driven by higher sales volumes and improving cost leverage. Depreciation expense of $106 million in fiscal 2005 increased $23 million (28%) compared to $83 million in fiscal 2004. National Welders contributed $9 million in additional depreciation expense and acquisitions contributed approximately $8 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the current and prior years capital investments in revenue producing assets, including medical cylinders and bulk tanks. The Companys lease buyout program to purchase long lived assets subject to high cost leases also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense in fiscal 2005. Amortization expense in fiscal 2005 of $5.5 million was consistent with the prior year. Operating Income Operating income increased 21% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 driven by higher sales and the consolidation of National Welders. The operating income margin decreased 50 basis points to 8.4% from 8.9% in the prior year. (In thousands) 2005 2004 Increase Distribution $ 158,018 $ 136,449 $ 21,569 16 % All Other Operations 45,215 31,331 13,884 44 % $ 203,233 $ 167,780 $ 35,453 21 % The Distribution segments operating income margin of 7.6% in fiscal 2005 decreased 40 basis points compared to 8.0% in the prior year. BOC integration costs and the separation package for the Companys former Chief Operating Officer contributed 30 basis points to the decline in the operating income margin. The decrease in the operating income margin also reflected the lower gross profit margin, described above. The All Other Operations segments operating income margin decreased 160 basis points to 11.7% from 13.3% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the operating income margin primarily resulted from the consolidation of National Welders, which carries a lower operating income margin compared to the other businesses in the All Other Operations segment. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the comparable operating income margin would have been 11.5%. 20 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $56 million representing an increase of $10 million (22%) compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense primarily resulted from higher debt levels associated with acquisitions, principally the BOC acquisition. The increase in interest expense was also driven by higher weighted average interest rates. The consolidation of National Welders contributed $2 million to the increase in interest expense. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $190 million and $163 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates at March 31, 2005 was 61% fixed to 39% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Based on the Companys outstanding variable rate debt and credit rating at March 31, 2005, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates its annual interest expense would increase approximately $1 million. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 36.8% of pre tax earnings in fiscal 2005 compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2004. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2005 resulted from changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the realization of federal and state tax credits. Minority Interest and Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate In fiscal 2005, the Company modified its presentation of minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to improve the presentation of the relationship between earnings before taxes and income tax expense. The new presentation reflects both the minority interest related to National Welders and the equity income recognized in prior periods related to National Welders, net of tax, below income tax expense. The Company also reclassified earnings of its partnership interest in AC Industries from equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to other income (expense). The reclassifications have been reflected in all prior periods to conform with the new presentation. Minority interest expense represents the portion of National Welders earnings applicable to the preferred stockholders of National Welders. Minority interest expense in fiscal 2005 represents a full year of expense versus one quarter in fiscal 2004, reflecting the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in fiscal 2004 of $4.4 million represents the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings through the date of consolidation. National Welders earnings included a $1.7 million after tax life insurance gain in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. Prior to the date that the Company entered into the joint venture agreement with National Welders, the founders of National Welders had obtained life insurance policies on key personnel in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. 21 Table of Contents Net Earnings Net earnings in fiscal 2005 were $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. The weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per diluted share increased by 2.3 million shares in fiscal 2005. The increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding primarily related to stock option exercises and shares purchased by employees under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plans. The Company expects that the weighted average number of shares outstanding will continue to increase by 2% to 3% per year. 22 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 OVERVIEW The Companys net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004) were $1.90 billion compared to $1.79 billion in the prior year (fiscal 2003). Sales growth of $109 million was driven by acquisitions, same store sales growth and the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. During fiscal 2004, the Company completed five acquisitions with combined annual sales of approximately $59 million. Strategic product sales initiatives related to medical, bulk and specialty gases, and strategic accounts, contributed to a 1% increase in total same store sales. Sales growth was achieved despite weakness in the manufacturing and industrial markets during much of fiscal 2004. While same store sales were flat through the first nine months of fiscal 2004, they began rebounding in the fourth quarter led by sales of hardgoods, which increased significantly (9%) as the industrial marketplace began to show signs of an economic recovery. Gas and rent sales also showed improvement (2%) in the fiscal fourth quarter. Fiscal 2004 net earnings were $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. As discussed in the Income Statement Commentary below, fiscal 2004 results were affected by the following: insurance related losses of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, representing the Companys self insurance retention associated with fire related losses; a $1.7 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, non recurring insurance gain recognized by National Welders; and a special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. Fiscal 2003 results were affected by the following: special and other charges totaling $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, primarily consisting of a restructuring charge ($2.7 million) related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) in fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. At December 31, 2003, the Company elected to adopt FIN 46R with respect to its joint venture with National Welders and consolidated this formerly unconsolidated affiliate. Since June 1996, the Company has participated in the joint venture and has used the equity method of accounting to report the Companys proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. Consequently, the consolidation of National Welders had no impact on the net earnings of the Company. In addition, the consolidation did not change the fact that the liabilities of the joint venture are non recourse to the Company and the cash flows, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders, are not available to the Company. Through the nine months ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized $4.4 million of Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate related to National Welders. With the prospective adoption permitted by FIN 46R (prior periods not restated), the fourth fiscal quarter operating results of the joint venture were reflected broadly across the income statement with minority interest expense reflecting the preferred stockholders proportionate share of the joint ventures operating results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, National Welders contributed $39 million to sales, $3 million to operating income, $452 thousand of minority interest expense and $1 million in net earnings. 23 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 6% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 driven primarily by acquisitions, same store sales growth of 1% and the consolidation of National Welders. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 1,702,471 $ 1,642,076 $ 60,395 4 % All Other Operations 235,926 183,849 52,077 28 % Intercompany eliminations (42,929 ) (38,961 ) (3,968 ) $ 1,895,468 $ 1,786,964 $ 108,504 6 % Distribution segment sales increased $60 million (4%) driven by acquisitions and growth in same store sales. The Company estimates that business acquisitions contributed $39 million to sales in fiscal 2004. Same store sales growth of $21 million (1%) resulted from increases in hardgoods sales of $13 million (1%) and gas and rent sales of $8 million (1%). Through the first nine months of fiscal 2004, Distribution same store sales were negative, driven by lower sales of hardgoods reflecting weakness in the industrial and manufacturing sectors of the economy. However, same store sales of hardgoods increased significantly (9%) in the fiscal fourth quarter as the industrial marketplace began to show signs of an economic recovery. Gas and rent sales also showed improvement (2%) in the fiscal fourth quarter. Same store sales of safety products increased a strong 6% during fiscal 2004 as the Company continued its cross selling strategy of marketing safety products to its broad base of customers. During fiscal 2004, strategic product sales initiatives contributed to sales growth of gas and rent, which helped mitigate weakness in the industrial economy. Medical gas and rent revenues increased 8% to $146 million versus the prior year reflecting volume gains. Sales growth of specialty gases fell short of expectations, driven by pricing pressure and sluggish demand associated with economic conditions. Bulk gas and rent revenues grew 8% to $107 million reflecting higher volumes as well as the promotion of the Companys micro bulk program. The micro bulk program is designed to service niche customers who require higher volumes of gases than can be provided efficiently through the use of gases packaged in cylinders. Sales to strategic account customers (sales to large customers with multiple locations) increased 3% to $255 million in fiscal 2004. Rental revenue was also favorably impacted by a 7% increase in welding equipment rentals and sales associated with the Companys continued expansion of its rental welder fleet. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany sales eliminations, increased $48 million (33%), principally from the consolidation of National Welders, same store sales growth and an acquisition during fiscal 2004. National Welders contributed sales of $39 million in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, it would have contributed sales of $147 million. Same store sales growth of 5% was principally the result of higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide reflecting the additional source of product from the Hopewell, Virginia plant that began operations in January 2003. Same store sales growth associated with liquid carbon dioxide was partially offset by lower sales of dry ice. Sales of dry ice were negatively impacted during fiscal 2004 by significant pricing pressure related to additional competition in the market. The acquisition of a dry ice business in April 2003 also contributed sales of $2 million in fiscal 2004. 24 Table of Contents Gross Profits Gross profits increased 5%, while the gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points to 52.1% in fiscal 2004 compared to 52.4% in fiscal 2003. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 857,031 $ 835,756 $ 21,275 3 % All Other Operations 129,756 100,892 28,864 29 % $ 986,787 $ 936,648 $ 50,139 5 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $21 million (3%) compared to the prior year. Distributions gross profit margin of 50.3% in fiscal 2004 decreased 60 basis points from 50.9% in fiscal 2003. The lower gross profit margin primarily resulted from a shift in sales mix away from higher margin gas and rent sales and towards lower margin sales of hardgoods. Acquisitions of two distributors of safety products also contributed to the shift in mix. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 51.8% gas and rent compared to 52.6% in fiscal 2003. All Other Operations gross profits increased $29 million (29%) compared to the prior year. Higher gross profits primarily reflect the consolidation of National Welders, higher sales volumes of liquid carbon dioxide sourced from the new Hopewell, Virginia plant and an acquisition. The consolidation of National Welders contributed gross profits of $22 million. The gross profit margin of 55% was flat compared to 54.9% in the prior year. The fourth quarter consolidation of National Welders had an insignificant impact on the gross profit margin. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the impact on the All Other Operations segments gross profit margin would also not have been significant. Operating Expenses SDA expenses increased $34 million (5%) compared to the prior year principally from the consolidation of National Welders, higher distribution related expenses, costs contributed by acquired businesses and fire related losses. The consolidation of National Welders contributed $16 million to the increase in SDA expenses. The increase in distribution related expenses of approximately $5 million was primarily driven by higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the increase in oil prices during fiscal 2004. Acquired businesses contributed approximately $13 million to the increase in SDA expenses. During fiscal 2004, the Company sustained fire related losses at certain of its plants of $2.8 million, which represented the Companys self insurance retention. The prior year included costs of $2.7 million associated with the integration of the packaged gas business acquired from Air Products in February 2002. Acquisition integration expenses were not significant during fiscal 2004. As a percentage of net sales, SDA expenses decreased 50 basis points to 38.6% compared to 39.1% in the prior year. Depreciation expense of $83 million in fiscal 2004 increased $9 million (12%) compared to $74 million in fiscal 2003. The increase reflects depreciation on the current and prior years capital investments in revenue producing assets, including the Hopewell carbon dioxide plant, bulk and micro bulk tanks and medical cylinders. The fourth quarter consolidation of National Welders also contributed approximately $3 million to the increase in depreciation expense. Amortization expense of $5.4 million in fiscal 2004 decreased $1 million compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in amortization expense was primarily attributable to the expiration of certain non compete agreements. 25 Table of Contents Special Charges (Recoveries) In fiscal 2004, a special charge recovery of $776 thousand consisted of lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring charges. The special charge recovery was included in the Distribution segment and represented a change in estimate related to facility exit costs. In fiscal 2003, the Company recognized a special charge of $2.7 million related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products and costs related to the consolidation of certain hardgoods procurement functions. The special charge included facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain facilities and employee severance. The facilities exited and the affected employees were part of the Companys existing operations prior to the acquisition of the Air Products business. Operating Income Operating income increased 8% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The operating income margin increased 20 basis points to 8.9% from 8.7% in the prior year. (In thousands) 2004 2003 Increase Distribution $ 136,449 $ 130,534 $ 5,915 5 % All Other Operations 31,331 25,348 5,983 24 % $ 167,780 $ 155,882 $ 11,898 8 % The Distribution segments operating income margin of 8% in fiscal 2004 was consistent with 7.9% in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2004 operating income margin reflects the lower gross profit margin, described above, effectively offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. The All Other Operations segments operating income margin decreased 50 basis points to 13.3% compared to 13.8% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the operating income margin primarily resulted from higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales driven by the consolidation of National Welders. National Welders has a higher cost structure compared to the other businesses included in the segment. Had National Welders been consolidated for all of fiscal 2004, the operating income margin would have been 11.5%. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled approximately $46 million representing a decrease of $4 million ( 8%) compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in interest expense resulted from lower average outstanding debt levels and lower weighted average interest rates associated with the Companys variable rate debt. The Companys interest expense and average outstanding debt levels were lower despite the July 1, 2003 consolidation of a grantor trust associated with an operating lease and the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $163 million and $159 million at March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates at March 31, 2004 was 57% fixed to 43% variable. 26 Table of Contents Minority Interest and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate Minority interest expense represents the portion of National Welders earnings applicable to the preferred stockholders of National Welders. Minority interest expense in fiscal 2004 represents one quarter of expense as a result of the December 31, 2003 consolidation. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in fiscal 2004 of $4.4 million represents the Companys portion of National Welders net earnings through the date of consolidation. The increase in fiscal 2004 equity earnings compared to fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from a $1.7 million after tax life insurance gain in which National Welders was the named beneficiary. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.3% of pre tax earnings in fiscal 2004 compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2003. Net Earnings Net earnings in fiscal 2004 were $80 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. 27 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2005 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $222 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $211 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2005 operating cash flows resulted from higher net earnings adjusted for non cash items and cash provided by the trade receivables securitization, partially offset by an increase in cash used by working capital. Net earnings adjusted for non cash items provided cash of $246 million versus $194 million in fiscal 2004. Working capital used cash of $52 million in 2005 versus providing cash of $13 million in 2004. Working capital components used cash in fiscal 2005 reflecting higher levels of hardgoods inventory and trade receivables in connection with overall sales growth. The Company increased the level of receivables sold under its trade receivables securitization program generating incremental cash compared to 2004 of $24 million. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 were primarily used to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. Cash from operations in fiscal 2005 includes $20 million of cash provided by National Welders compared to $10 million associated with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The cash flows of National Welders, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders to the Company, are not available to the Company. Prior to the fourth quarter 2004 consolidation of National Welders, the management fee paid by National Welders to the Company was reflected as an investing activity as fees from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash used in investing activities totaled $353 million and primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions of $192 million and capital expenditures of $168 million. Acquisitions in fiscal 2005 primarily consisted of $175 million paid for the BOC acquisition. Capital expenditures were $74 million higher than in fiscal 2004 driven by spending for cylinders and bulk tanks reflecting continued investment to support the Companys strategic sales initiatives, such as those related to medical and bulk gases. In addition, fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included $35 million ($11 million at National Welders) of real estate and tube trailer lease buyouts under a program to purchase long lived assets that were subject to high cost operating leases. For fiscal 2006, the Company estimates that capital spending will approximate 5% of sales. Financing activities provided cash of $139 million primarily from borrowings, which were raised to fund the BOC acquisition. Financing activities also included proceeds of $20 million received from the exercise of stock options. Dividends paid to stockholders during fiscal 2005 used cash of $14 million. Beginning with this annual report on Form 10 K, the Company has changed from a net cash presentation on the balance sheet to a gross presentation. Previously, the Company did not show cash balances as all depository cash and cash overdrafts were combined and the net overdraft was recorded in other current liabilities. In the current presentation, depository cash and cash overdrafts are presented on a gross basis. The Company has adopted the current presentation as it is consistent with the practice among most companies and is also more transparent. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The Company will continue to look for acquisitions to complement its existing businesses and improve its geographic coverage. Capital expenditures, current debt maturities and any future acquisitions will be funded through the use of cash flow from operations, revolving credit facilities, and other financing alternatives. The Company believes that its sources of financing are adequate for its anticipated needs and that it could arrange additional sources of financing for unanticipated requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangement depend on the market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time. 28 Table of Contents Dividends At the end of each quarter during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.045 and $0.040 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 24, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share, representing a 33% increase compared to the prior year quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable June 30, 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2005. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Instruments Senior Credit Agreement On January 14, 2005, the Company amended and restated its senior credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) to extend the maturity date from July 30, 2006 to January 14, 2010 and to provide the Company with more flexibility to invest in growth and or return cash to stockholders. Accordingly, the Credit Agreement significantly reduces the limitations on acquisitions, restricted payments and debt incurrence. The Credit Agreement also allows for the expansion of the Companys trade receivables securitization up to a maximum of $300 million in trade receivables. The Credit Agreement continues to require that the Company maintain certain leverage and coverage ratios. As provided for in the Credit Agreement, the computations of the restrictive covenants include pro forma results of acquired businesses. As such, the amount borrowed to finance an acquisition does not reduce the Companys borrowing capacity by a similar amount. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company has unsecured senior credit facilities that provide revolving credit lines of $308 million and Canadian $50 million and a term loan. As of March 31, 2005, the Company had revolving credit borrowings of approximately $136 million, Canadian $27 million (U.S. $22 million), and term loan borrowings of $96 million. The Company also had commitments under letters of credit of $33 million supported by the Credit Agreement at March 31, 2005. After considering the covenant limitations, as of March 31, 2005, the effective additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was approximately U.S. $159 million. The U.S. dollar borrowings bear interest of LIBOR plus 95 basis points and the Canadian dollar borrowings bear interest at the Canadian Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 95 basis points. As of March 31, 2005, the effective interest rate on the U.S. dollar revolving credit lines, the Canadian dollar credit lines and the U.S. dollar term loan were 3.74%, 4.67% and 4.04%, respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, the Companys domestic subsidiaries guarantee the U.S. borrowings and Canadian borrowings, and the Companys foreign subsidiaries also guarantee the Canadian borrowings. The guarantees are full and unconditional and are made on a joint and several basis. The Company has pledged 100% of the stock of its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries as surety for its obligations under the agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for the release of the guarantees and collateral if the Company attains an investment grade credit rating and maintains such rating for two consecutive quarters. 29 Table of Contents Medium Term Notes At March 31, 2005, the Company had $100 million of medium term notes due September 2006 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%. The medium term notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities. The Company has pledged the stock of its domestic guarantors for the benefit of the note holders. Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long term debt also included acquisition and other notes principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2005, acquisition and other notes totaled approximately $10 million with interest rates ranging from 4% to 9%. Senior Subordinated Notes At March 31, 2005, the Company had $150 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2004 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of July 15, 2014. The 2004 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2004 notes have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2004 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is July 15, 2009 at a price of 103.1% of the principal amount. In addition to the 2004 Notes, at March 31, 2005, the Company had $225 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2001 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of October 1, 2011. The 2001 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.125%, payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2001 notes also have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2001 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is October 1, 2006 at a price of 104.6% of the principal amount. The 2004 Notes and 2001 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The 2004 Notes and 2001 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities. The stock of the Companys domestic subsidiaries is also pledged to the note holders on a subordinated basis. Financial Instruments of the National Welders Joint Venture Pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46R, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2005 and 2004 include the financial obligations of National Welders. National Welders financial obligations are non recourse to the Company, meaning that the creditors of National Welders do not have a claim on the assets of Airgas, Inc. National Welders has a credit agreement (the NWS Credit Agreement) that provides for available credit up to $100 million secured by certain assets. The NWS Credit Agreement provides for a Term Loan A of $26 million, a Term Loan B of $21 million, a Term Loan C of $9 million, and a revolving credit line of $44 million. Term Loan A is repayable in monthly amounts of $254 thousand with a lump sum payment of the outstanding balance at maturity in June 2007. Term Loan B (See subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) matures in July 2006 and Term Loan C matures in 30 Table of Contents September 2006. The revolving credit line matures in June 2007. The NWS Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, limit the ability of National Welders to incur and guarantee new indebtedness, subject National Welders to minimum net worth requirements, and limit its capital expenditures, ownership changes, merger and acquisition activity, and the payment of dividends. At March 31, 2005, National Welders had borrowings under its revolving credit line of $22 million, under Term Loan A of $18 million, under Term Loan B of $21 million, and under Term C of $3.5 million. Interest rates on Term Loans A, B and the revolving credit line are variable and range from LIBOR plus 150 to 225 basis points based on National Welders leverage ratio. At March 31, 2005, the effective interest rate for Term Loans A, B and the revolving credit line was 4.85%. Term Loan C bears a fixed interest rate of 7%. Based on restrictions related to certain leverage ratios, National Welders had additional borrowing capacity under its NWS Credit Agreement of approximately $22 million at March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2005, Term Loan A and the revolving credit line are secured by certain current assets, principally trade receivables and inventory, totaling $30 million, non current assets, principally equipment, totaling $71 million, and Airgas common stock with a market value of $22 million classified as treasury stock and carried at cost of $370 thousand. Term Loan B is secured by a $21 million note receivable from the preferred stockholders of National Welders (See Subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In consolidation, the note receivable is presented as a reduction to the minority interest liability. Term Loan C is secured by a production facility, which had a net book value of approximately $14 million at March 31, 2005. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company and National Welders manage exposure to changes in market interest rates. At March 31, 2005, the Company was party to a total of four interest rate swap agreements. The swap agreements are with major financial institutions and aggregate $100 million in notional principal amount. These swap agreements require the Company to make fixed interest payments based on an average effective rate of 3.59% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on one month and three month LIBOR (average rate of 2.73% at March 31, 2005). The remaining terms of these swap agreements range from between seven months and four years. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties. On March 30, 2005, the Company terminated four variable interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of $125 million. The interest rate swap agreements previously converted a corresponding amount of fixed rate medium term notes and the senior subordinated notes due 2011 to variable rate debt. As a result of swap termination, the Company received $3.9 million in cash. The corresponding gain on the termination has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the notes. National Welders participates in one interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of $21 million on which it makes interest payments based on a fixed rate of 6.72% and receives variable interest payments from its counterparty based on a floating 30 day LIBOR rate of 2.85% at March 31, 2005 (See subsequent events Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable interest rates was approximately 61% fixed to 39% variable at March 31, 2005. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the LIBOR. Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio at March 31, 2005, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $1 million. 31 Table of Contents Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in February 2008, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. During fiscal 2005, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $2,204 million of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $2,177 million in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $190 million at March 31, 2005 and $163 million at March 31, 2004. The transaction has been accounted for as a sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Under the securitization agreement, eligible trade receivables are sold to bank conduits through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying value of the receivables is recognized as Discount on securitization of trade receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings and varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. The Company retains a subordinated interest in the receivables sold, which is recorded at the receivables previous carrying value. A subordinated retained interest of approximately $57 million and $44 million is included in Trade receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys retained interest is generally collected within 60 days. On a monthly basis, management measures the fair value of the retained interest at managements best estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the transferred receivables. Changes in the fair value are recognized as bad debt expense. Actual cash collections may differ from these estimates and would directly affect the fair value of the retained interest. In accordance with a servicing agreement, the Company continues to service, administer and collect the trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits approximate the costs of collections. Debt of Grantor Trust In October 2004, the Company used funds from its revolving credit facilities to refinance its $41 million debt obligation under a sale leaseback arrangement with a grantor trust. Since the Company had previously consolidated the grantor trust in July 2003 in accordance with the adoption of FIN 46, there was no net change in the Companys outstanding debt as a result of the maturity of the sale leaseback arrangement. Employee Benefits Trust Since March 1999, the Company has maintained an Employee Benefits Trust (the Trust) to fund certain future obligations of the Companys employee benefit and compensation plans. From inception through 2001, the Company, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, sold approximately 7 million shares of common stock, previously held as treasury stock, to the Trust. The Company holds promissory notes from the Trust in the amount of common stock purchased by the trust. Shares held by the Trust serve as collateral for the promissory notes and are available to fund certain employee benefit plan obligations as the promissory notes are repaid. The shares held by the Employee Benefits Trust are not considered outstanding for earnings per share purposes until they are released from serving as collateral for the promissory notes. Approximately 1.9 million and 1.2 million shares were issued from the Employee Benefits Trust for employee benefit programs during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of March 31, 2005, the Employee Benefits Trust held 338 thousand shares of Company common stock. The remaining shares were issued from the Trust during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for employee stock option exercises. 32 Table of Contents Inflation While the U.S. inflation rate has been relatively modest for several years, rising costs continue to affect the Companys business. The Company strives to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment and price increases under highly competitive conditions. OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.
