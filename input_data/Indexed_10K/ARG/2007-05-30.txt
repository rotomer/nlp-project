No stock based compensation expense was reflected in prior periods. Fiscal 2007 results also include a charge of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax), or approximately $0.10 per diluted share, for the early extinguishment of debt and a one time tax benefit of $0.02 per diluted share related to a change in the state income tax law in Texas. 19 Table of Contents (2) As discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2006 include an after tax charge of $2.5 million as a result of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, an after tax loss of $1.9 million on the divestiture of Rutland Tool, which was reported as a discontinued operation, and an estimated loss of $2.2 million ($1.4 million after tax) related to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Working capital decreased in fiscal 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in the current portion of long term debt. (3) As discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2005 include integration costs related to the acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. and employee separation costs of $6.4 million ($4 million after tax). Fiscal 2005 also reflected a full year of National Welders as a consolidated affiliate. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for the effect of the consolidation of National Welders on the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) The results for fiscal 2004 include a fourth quarter special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax) reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. Fiscal 2004 results also include the fourth quarter consolidation of the National Welders joint venture in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R). Prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company used the Equity Method of Accounting for its investment in National Welders. Accordingly, the consolidation of National Welders under FIN 46R did not have an impact on the Companys net earnings. (5) The results for fiscal 2003 include special charges of $2.7 million ($2.1 million after tax) consisting of a restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products Chemicals, Inc. (6) During fiscal 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07, $0.06, $0.045 and $0.04 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 8, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share payable June 29, 2007 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2007. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors.

The reclassifications reflect the presentation of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. 20 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Item 7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 OVERVIEW Airgas, Inc. (the Company) had net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (fiscal 2007 or current year) of $3.20 billion compared to $2.83 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006 or prior year). Net sales increased by 13% driven by strong same store sales growth and the impact of acquisitions. Same store sales growth contributed 8% to the increase in total sales. Same store sales growth was driven equally by pricing initiatives and higher sales volumes. Price increases were initiated in response to rising product, operating and distribution costs. Higher sales volumes resulted from the continued strength of the industrial economy, the non residential construction environment, and the continued success of the Companys growth initiatives. Acquisitions continue to be an important component of the Companys growth contributing 5% to the overall increase in net sales. Operating income margin expanded 120 basis points in the current year to 10.7% compared to 9.5% in the prior year reflecting continued operating leverage. Solid sales growth and operating expense discipline resulted in income from continuing operations of $154.4 million or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share in fiscal 2006. Accounting Change Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective method. The new standard requires the Company to estimate the value of stock options issued to employees, including options to purchase shares under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and recognize stock based compensation expense over the period in which the options vest. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company used the intrinsic value method outlined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 to account for stock based compensation. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $15.4 million ($10.9 million after tax) or $0.13 per diluted share. Since the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, no stock based compensation expense was reflected in earnings prior to April 1, 2006. Financing Effective July 25, 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Subject to compliance with certain covenants, the $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility) permits the Company to borrow up to $966 million under a U.S. dollar revolving credit line, up to C$40 million (U.S. $34 million) under a Canadian dollar revolving credit line and up to $600 million under two or more term loans. The Company used borrowings under the term loan provision of the Credit Facility to finance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006 and the remaining $500 million for the Linde bulk gas acquisition that closed on March 9, 2007. The Credit Facility matures on July 25, 2011. On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes due October 1, 2011 (the Notes) at a premium of 104.563% of the principal amount with borrowing under the Companys Credit Facility. In conjunction with the redemption of the Notes, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax), or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 21 Table of Contents Acquisitions During fiscal 2007, the Company completed 13 acquisitions with combined annual sales of approximately $336 million. The largest of these acquisitions include the September 2006 purchase of Houston, Texas based Aeriform Corporation, a distributor of industrial gases and related hardgoods. Aeriform, with 29 locations and 240 employees in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas, generated annual revenue of $65 million. In November 2006, the Company purchased the Union Industrial Gas Group, a distributor of industrial gases and related hardgoods. The Union Industrial Gas Group, with 14 locations and 100 employees in New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana, had annual revenue of $38 million. In January 2007, the Company purchased CFC Refimax, a leading full service refrigerant supplier and reclamation company. CFC Refimax, based in Atlanta, Georgia with 50 employees, generated annual revenue of $19 million. In March 2007, the Company acquired Lindes divested U.S. bulk gas assets. The Linde bulk gas business, consisting of eight air separation units (ASUs) and 300 employees, produced annual revenue of $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. With the acquisition of the Linde bulk gas business, the Company formed a new business unit, Airgas Merchant Gases, to manage production, distribution and administrative functions for seven of the air separation plants. One air separation plant and its aligned sales was transferred to the Companys National Welders joint venture. In connection with the transaction, most of the acquired bulk gas customers and related service equipment was transfered to existing Distribution business units. Airgas Merchant Gases principally operates as an internal supplier of bulk oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the business units in the Distribution business segment. Pending Acquisition On March 29, 2007, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire, for $310 million in cash, a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde AG. The operations to be acquired include branches, warehouses, packaged gas fill plants, and other operations involved in distributing packaged industrial and specialty gases and related hardgoods. The business includes 130 locations in 18 states, with more than 1,400 employees, which generated $346 million in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately 50 percent of the revenue was from gas sales and cylinder rent, with the remainder from sales of welding equipment and supplies. The acquisition will be financed under the Companys Credit Facility. Looking Forward The Company anticipates that fiscal 2008 will be another productive year. The Company expects further expansion of the industrial economy during fiscal 2008 and estimates fiscal 2008 net earnings to be between $2.33 to $2.41 per diluted share. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company estimates that it will earn between $0.52 to $0.54 per diluted share. The estimate of fiscal 2008 net earnings anticipates a supportive sales environment and continued success of pricing actions designed to offset rising costs. The annual earnings guidance does not reflect anticipated earnings from the pending acquisition of Lindes U.S. packaged gas business. In accordance with the Companys standard practice, the earnings guidance, noted above, does not reflect any impact from acquisitions that have not closed at the time the guidance is issued. However, the acquired Linde business, net of integration costs, is expected to be slightly accretive in the first twelve months of operation. 22 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 13% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 driven by strong same store sales growth of 8% and acquisition growth of 5%. Same store sales growth reflected pricing initiatives, volume growth, and strategic product sales gains, driven by the continued strength of the industrial production, energy and non residential construction markets served by the Company. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. Net Sales (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 2,691,814 $ 2,395,938 $ 295,876 12 % All Other Operations 579,671 493,430 86,241 17 % Intercompany eliminations (66,434 ) (59,758 ) (6,676 ) $ 3,205,051 $ 2,829,610 $ 375,441 13 % The Distribution segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases; cylinder and equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, and maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) supplies. Distribution segment sales increased 12% compared to the prior year driven by same store sales growth of $200 million (8%) and sales contributed by both current and prior year acquisitions of $96 million. The increase in Distribution same store sales resulted from higher hardgoods sales of $82 million (8%) and gas and rent sales growth of $105 million (8%). Broad demand from industrial, energy infrastructure and non residential construction sectors helped the Companys core gas and welding hardgoods business. Several of the Companys business units reported double digit growth. Sales growth was also driven by double digit growth of strategic products sales. Strategic products are identified by the Company as those expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall industrial economy and include safety products, medical, specialty, and bulk gases, as well as carbon dioxide products, such as dry ice. Accordingly, the Company has initiatives focused on promoting these products. Approximately 75% of the Distribution segments $96 million sales growth contributed by acquisitions was the result of current year acquisitions. Current year acquisitions attributable to the Distribution segment historically generated annual revenue of approximately $300 million. The largest of the current year acquisitions closed in the second half of the fiscal year, with the Linde bulk gas acquisition closing in March 2007. Fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to contribute more than $200 million to the Distribution segments sales growth in fiscal 2008. Additionally as noted in the overview section above, the pending acquisition of a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde, with annual revenues of $346 million, approximately $50 million of which will be acquired by the Companys joint venture National Welders (which is accounted for in the All Other Operations segment), should also be a significant contributor to fiscal 2008 sales growth. The Distribution segments gas and rent same store sales of 8% reflects both price increases and volume growth. The impact of price increases reflects pricing actions implemented in June 2006 and November 2005. Sales of industrial gases during the current year remained strong reflecting demand from the Companys core industrial markets. Sales of strategic gas products increased 11% in the current 23 Table of Contents year driven by bulk, medical and specialty gas sales gains. Bulk gas sales volumes were up related to growth in micro bulk and the signing of new bulk customer contracts. Medical gas sales growth was attributable to higher demand from the hospital sector as well as success of the Walk O2 Bout medical cylinder program. Rental revenues benefited from the Companys rental welder business that generated 33% same store sales growth in the current year. The rebuilding effort in the Gulf Coast area, power plant construction projects and the strong non residential construction market contributed to the increase in demand for welding machines, gases and consumables. Hardgoods same store sales growth reflects continued volume and pricing gains. The Companys successful Radnor private label brand of products generated sales growth of 11% in the current year, reaching a total of $128 million. Same store sales of safety products increased 10% reflecting the success of the telemarketing operations (telesales) and effective cross selling of safety products to new and existing customers. The All Other Operations segment consists of the Companys Gas Operations Division, Airgas Merchant Gases and the National Welders joint venture. The Gas Operations Division produces and distributes certain gas products, principally carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, specialty gases, anhydrous ammonia and related supplies, services and equipment. Airgas Merchant Gases was formed with the acquisition of the Linde bulk gas business to manage production, distribution and administrative functions for the acquired air separation plants. National Welders is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods based in Charlotte, North Carolina. All Other Operations sales increased $86 million (17%) compared to the prior year resulting from same store sales growth and acquisitions. Same store sales growth of 8% was driven by continued sales gains of National Welders and growth in carbon dioxide products. Sales of dry ice and liquid carbon dioxide were strong contributors to sales growth in the current year reflecting success in the food processing and industrial carbon dioxide markets and the Companys nationwide network of Penguin dry ice retail locations. Sales growth from acquisitions primarily reflects a prior year acquisition of a packaged gas distributor by National Welders. Current year acquisitions reflected in the All Other Operations business segment include CFC Refimax, and the Linde bulk gas business. Current year acquisitions did not significantly impact the current years sales growth as they closed in the fourth quarter. However, the fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to have a significant impact on the All Other Operations sales growth in fiscal 2008. The most significant contributor to the All Other Operations sales growth will be Airgas Merchant Gases. However, Airgas Merchant Gases will principally be a wholesale supplier to the business units in the Distribution business segment. Therefore, the sales of Airgas Merchant Gases to the Distrubution segment will be eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Third party sales from the fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to contribute approximately $55 million to fiscal 2008 sales growth. As noted above, upon closing the pending acquisition of a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde, operations with approximately $50 million in annual revenue would be acquired by the Companys National Welders joint venture, also contributing to the fiscal 2008 sales growth. Gross Profits Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. As disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company reflects distribution costs as elements of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment on the income statement line item Depreciation. Other companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their Cost of Products Sold, and as such the Companys gross profits discussed below may not be comparable to those of other entities. 24 Table of Contents Gross profits increased 15% principally from sales growth and acquisitions. The gross margin in the current period was 51.1% compared to 50.5% in the prior year period. Gross Profit (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 1,336,447 $ 1,172,503 $ 163,944 14 % All Other Operations 301,514 255,129 46,385 18 % $ 1,637,961 $ 1,427,632 $ 210,329 15 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $164 million (14%) compared to the prior year. The Distribution segments gross margin was 49.6% versus 48.9% in the prior year. The increase in the gross margin of 70 basis points reflected the impact of price increases as well as a favorable shift in product mix toward and within gas and rent. Gas and rent as a percentage of the Distribution segments sales was 52.0% in the current year as compared to 51.7% in the prior year. The All Other Operations segments gross profits increased $46 million (18%) primarily from strong sales growth at National Welders and sales volume growth of carbon dioxide products. The segments gross margin increased 30 basis points to 52.0% versus 51.7% in the prior year period driven by improvement in pricing and margin expansion particularly with respect to the anhydrous ammonia product line acquired in June 2005. Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SDA) consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SDA expense decreased 50 basis points to 35.9% compared to 36.4% in the prior year reflecting improved cost leverage and effective cost management. The decrease in SDA expense as a percentage of sales occurred despite $15.4 million or approximately 50 basis points of stock based compensation expense in the current year (as described in the Overview section above). There was no stock based compensation expense in the prior year. SDA expenses increased $118 million (11%) primarily from higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes and the operating costs of acquired businesses. Acquisitions contributed estimated incremental SDA expenses of approximately $30 million in the current year. The increase in SDA expense attributable to factors other than stock based compensation and acquisitions was approximately $72 million or an increase of 7% primarily attributable to salaries and wages and distribution related expenses The increase in salaries and wages reflected increased operational headcounts and overtime to fill cylinders, deliver products and operate facilities to meet increased customer demand. The increase in distribution expenses was attributable to higher fuel and vehicle repair and maintenance costs, which were up approximately $12 million versus the prior year. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise in diesel fuel prices over the past year and the increase in miles driven to support related sales growth . Operating expenses in the prior year include $2.2 million associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Depreciation expense of $139 million increased $16 million (13%) compared to the prior year. Acquired businesses contributed depreciation expense of approximately $3.3 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the current and prior years capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand, primarily cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders, as well as the addition of new fill plants and branch stores. Amortization expense of $8.5 million was $3.4 million higher than the prior year period driven by the amortization of customer lists and non compete agreements associated with acquisitions. 25 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income increased 27% in the current year driven by higher sales levels and margin improvement. Improved cost leverage on sales growth was the primary contributor to a 120 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 10.7% compared to 9.5% in the prior year. Operating Income (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 266,708 $ 208,466 $ 58,242 28 % All Other Operations 74,744 60,292 14,452 24 % $ 341,452 $ 268,758 $ 72,694 27 % Operating income in the Distribution segment increased 28% in the current year. The Distribution segments operating margin increased 120 basis points to 9.9% compared to 8.7% in the prior year. The significant margin improvement was driven by continued operating profit leverage on sales growth and effective management of costs and pricing. Operating income in the All Other Operations segment increased 24% compared to the prior year. The segments operating income margin of 12.9% was 70 basis points higher than 12.2% in the prior year. The increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the strong business momentum of National Welders and the improved anhydrous ammonia business. The acquired Linde bulk gas business is expected to improve the Companys consolidated fiscal 2008 operating income and operating margin. The newly formed Airgas Merchant Gases, accounted for in the All Other Operations segment, will principally act as an internal wholesale supplier to the Distribution segment business units. The business units in the Distribution segment will manage the customer relationships and bill the new bulk gas customers. Since the end customer is served by the Distribution segment companies, the improved operating margin will principally be reflected in the Distribution business segment. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $74 million representing an increase of 17% compared to the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from higher average debt levels associated with acquisitions, a larger securitization program and higher weighted average interest rates related to the Companys variable rate debt instruments, partially offset by the current year refinancing of higher fixed rate debt. In July 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Facility expanded the Companys borrowing capacity, subject to compliance with certain covenants, to $1.6 billion principally at an effective interest rate of LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The Company used the Credit Facility to refinance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006. Additionally, on October 27, 2006, the Company used the Credit Facility to redeem its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes. Based on current interest rates under the revolving credit facility, interest savings from these refinancings are estimated to be $700 thousand per month. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $264 million at March 31, 2007 versus $244 million at March 31, 2006. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. 26 Table of Contents As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2007 was 21% fixed to 79% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $3 million. Loss on Debt Extinguishment On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes at a premium of 104.563% with borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company recognized a third quarter charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax) or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.8% of pre tax earnings in the current year compared to 37.4% in the prior year. The effective income tax rate in the current year reflects a one time tax benefit associated with changes in state income tax law in Texas. Additionally, the current years tax rate reflects the limited deductibility of stock based compensation associated with the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the absence of state tax benefits associated with the loss on the extinguishment of debt. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2006 reflected favorable changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and a favorable adjustment to previously recorded tax liabilities. The Company expects the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 to range from 39% to 39.5% of pre tax earnings. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations in the current year was $154 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, which reflects an after tax loss of $7.9 million from the early extinguishment of debt, or $0.10 per diluted share, stock based compensation expense of $10.9 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share, and $1.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, one time tax benefit associated with changes in state income tax law. Income from continuing operations in the prior period was $128 million, or $1.62 per diluted share. Stock based compensation expense was not recognized in the prior year. Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations In December 2005, the Company divested its business unit Rutland Tool Supply Co., Inc. (Rutland Tool). Consequently, the operating results of Rutland Tool for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are reflected as discontinued operations. For fiscal 2006, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. 27 Table of Contents Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Effective March 31, 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, (FIN 47), and recorded a $2.5 million after tax charge ($0.03 per diluted share) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Net Earnings Net earnings were $154.4 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $123.6 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in the prior year. Pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the preferred stock of National Welders, until June 30, 2009, the preferred stockholders have the option to exchange their 3.2 million shares of National Welders voting redeemable preferred stock either for cash at a price of $17.78 per share or to tender them to the joint venture in exchange for approximately 2.3 million shares of Airgas common stock. If Airgas common stock has a market value of $24.45 per share, the stock and cash redemption options are equivalent. The weighted shares used in the fiscal 2007 and 2006 diluted earnings per share calculations include the assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock. Also see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. 28 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 OVERVIEW The Company had net sales for fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006) of $2.83 billion compared to $2.37 billion for fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005). Net sales increased by 20% driven by strong same store sales growth and the impact of acquisitions. Same store sales growth contributed 11% to the increase in total sales. Acquisitions contributed 9% to the overall increase in net sales. The operating income margin expanded 90 basis points in fiscal 2006 to 9.5% compared to 8.6% in fiscal 2005 reflecting improving cost leverage. Solid sales growth and operating expense discipline resulted in income from continuing operations of $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to $91.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005, a 36% increase. Accounting Change Effective March 31, 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, (FIN 47), and recorded a $2.5 million after tax charge ($0.03 per diluted share) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Discontinued Operations On December 1, 2005, the Company divested its subsidiary, Rutland Tool. Rutland Tool distributed metalworking tools, machine tools and MRO supplies from seven locations and had approximately 180 employees. Rutland Tool generated annual sales of approximately $50 million and an insignificant amount of operating income. As a result of the divestiture, the Company reflected fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 operating results of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. The fiscal 2006 loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. Proceeds from the divestiture were approximately $15 million. The operating results of Rutland Tool were previously reflected in the Distribution business segment. Acquisitions During fiscal 2006, the Company completed 13 acquisitions (including three businesses acquired by the Companys joint venture, National Welders) with combined annual sales of approximately $141 million. The largest of these acquisitions included the June 2005 purchase of the Industrial Products Division of LaRoche Industries, Inc. (LaRoche). LaRoche was a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $65 million. The LaRoche operations were incorporated into a new business unit, Airgas Specialty Products, that was added to the All Other Operations business segment. 29 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 20% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 driven primarily by strong same store sales growth of 11% and acquisitions. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. Net Sales (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 2,395,938 $ 2,035,112 $ 360,826 18 % All Other Operations 493,430 385,611 107,819 28 % Intercompany eliminations (59,758 ) (52,941 ) (6,817 ) $ 2,829,610 $ 2,367,782 $ 461,828 20 % Distribution segment sales increased 18% compared to fiscal 2005 driven by same store sales growth of $245 million (11%) and sales contributed by both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 acquisitions of $116 million. Incremental sales from acquisitions were driven by nine fiscal 2006 acquisitions and the impact of a full year of operations of the July 2004 acquisition of the packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. (BOC). Same store sales growth was driven approximately equally by pricing initiatives and higher sales volumes. Price increases were initiated in response to rising product, operating and distribution costs as well as other factors. Higher sales volumes resulted from the continued strength of the industrial economy and the continued success of the Companys growth initiatives. Same store sales growth of hardgoods was 13%, and gas and rent was 10%, with a majority of the Companys business units reporting double digit growth. Sales growth in the Gulf Coast and southwestern portions of the U.S. was particularly strong reflecting post hurricane demand for equipment, safety products and welding machines. Sales growth was also driven by sales of strategic products. Strategic products were identified by the Company as those expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall industrial economy and include safety products, medical, specialty, and bulk gases, as well as carbon dioxide products, such as dry ice. The Distribution segments same store sales growth for gas and rent of 10% was driven by price increases and volume growth. Broad pricing actions were initiated in March 2005 and November 2005 in response to rising product and delivery costs. Sales growth was achieved across nearly all major product lines, including the largest product line, industrial gases (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, argon, acetylene, etc.). Sales of strategic products, particularly related to bulk, medical and specialty gases, also helped drive the growth in gas and rent same store sales. Sales of bulk, medical, and specialty gases generated combined same store sales growth of 12%. Same store sales growth was also helped by a 31% increase in welding equipment rentals. The increase in Distribution same store sales from hardgoods of $131 million (13%) is attributable to strong volume gains in sales of safety and Radnor private label products. Same store sales of safety products grew 17% in fiscal 2006 benefiting from excellent execution in cross selling and in our telesales operation, the strong industrial economy and reconstruction efforts along the Gulf Coast. Radnor products grew 26% reflecting the rollout of new products and expansion of the Companys branch store core stocking program to acquired locations. Same store sales of hardgoods also benefited from pricing actions taken during fiscal 2006 to offset rising product costs. 30 Table of Contents In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the All Other Operations segment consisted of the Companys Gas Operations Division and its National Welders joint venture. The Gas Operations Division produces and distributes certain gas products, principally carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. Beginning in June 2005, the division also began distributing anhydrous ammonia and related supplies, services and equipment. National Welders is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods based in Charlotte, North Carolina. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany eliminations, increased $101 million compared to fiscal 2005. The acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia business from LaRoche and the subsequent formation of Airgas Specialty Products in June 2005 contributed sales of $67 million in fiscal 2006. Same store sales growth was primarily attributable to National Welders and pricing actions taken by Airgas Specialty Products. Sales of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice also increased modestly. Gross Profits Gross profits increased 17% resulting from higher sales volumes, acquisitions and price increases. The gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points to 50.5% in fiscal 2006 compared to 51.4% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the gross profit margin reflects the acquisition and subsequent growth of the lower margin anhydrous ammonia product line and a shift in sales mix. Gross Profit (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 1,172,503 $ 1,004,828 $ 167,675 17 % All Other Operations 255,129 211,172 43,957 21 % $ 1,427,632 $ 1,216,000 $ 211,632 17 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $168 million (17%) compared to fiscal 2005. Distributions gross profit margin of 48.9% decreased 50 basis points from 49.4% in fiscal 2005. The lower gross profit margin reflects a shift in gas sales mix, including the impact of higher sales growth of lower margin bulk gases, as well as higher same store sales growth of lower margin hardgoods. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 51.7% gas and rent compared to 51.9% in fiscal 2005. Pricing actions taken by the Company in fiscal 2006 helped to mitigate the impact of rising product costs. The All Other Operations segments gross profits increased $44 million primarily from strong sales at National Welders and the addition of the anhydrous ammonia business in fiscal 2006. Although the gross profit dollars for the segment increased, the gross profit margin declined by 310 basis points to 51.7% from 54.8% in fiscal 2005. The gross profit margin decline reflects the acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia product line, which carries a lower margin than other products in this segment, and competitive pressures in the market for dry ice. Operating Expenses As a percentage of net sales, SDA expenses decreased 170 basis points to 36.4% compared to 38.1% in fiscal 2005 resulting from improved cost leverage. SDA expenses increased $129 million (14%) primarily from operating costs of acquired businesses and higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes. As compared with fiscal 2005, acquisitions contributed an estimated additional $62 million to SDA expenses. The SDA expenses contributed by fiscal 2006 acquisitions reflect acquisition integration costs that were $1.9 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 SDA expenses reflect a total of $6.4 million of costs associated with integrating the BOC acquisition as well as employee separation costs. The balance of the increase in SDA expenses is primarily attributable to higher labor costs, distribution related expenses, selling expenses and approximately $2.2 million of incremental costs resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in labor costs reflected costs to fill cylinders and operate facilities to meet increased demand for products as well as normal wage inflation. The increase in distribution expenses is attributable to higher fuel costs and vehicle repair and maintenance expenses. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise in diesel fuel prices and the increase in miles driven to support the higher sales volumes. The increase in selling expenses is attributable to higher sales levels. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation expense of $122 million increased $17 million (16%) compared to $105 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 acquisitions contributed depreciation expense of approximately $8 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects fiscal 2006s and fiscal 2005s capital expenditures to support growth, including purchases of cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders. Amortization expense of $5 million in fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005. Operating Income Operating income increased 33% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 driven by higher sales levels. Cost leverage and the improved operations of the BOC business acquired in fiscal 2005 contributed to a 90 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 9.5% compared to 8.6% in fiscal 2005. Operating Income (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 208,466 $ 157,239 $ 51,227 33 % All Other Operations 60,292 45,215 15,077 33 % $ 268,758 $ 202,454 $ 66,304 33 % Operating income in the Distribution segment increased 33% in fiscal 2006. The Distribution segments operating income margin increased 100 basis points to 8.7% compared to 7.7% in fiscal 2005. The increase in the operating income margin reflects the lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, described above. Fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by integration costs and initial lower margins of the business acquired from BOC. Operating income in the All Other Operations segment increased 33% resulting primarily from the strong business momentum of National Welders as well as the acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia business from LaRoche. The segments operating income margin increased 50 basis points to 12.2% in fiscal 2006 compared to 11.7% in fiscal 2005. The higher operating income margin principally relates to lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by the lower operating margin of the anhydrous ammonia business. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $63 million representing an increase of 13% compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in interest expense primarily resulted from higher debt levels associated with acquisitions and higher weighted average interest rates. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with commercial banks to sell qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $244 million and $190 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2006 was 53% fixed to 47% variable. 32 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 37.4% of pre tax earnings compared to 36.8% in fiscal 2005. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2005 resulted from favorable changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the realization of federal and state tax credits. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to $91.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share in fiscal 2005. Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations As a result of the divestiture of Rutland Tool in December 2005, the Company reflected fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 operating results of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. The fiscal 2006 loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. Proceeds from the divestiture were approximately $15 million. In fiscal 2005, income from discontinued operations was $464 thousand. The operating results of Rutland Tool were previously reflected in the Distribution business segment. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle In conjunction with the adoption of FIN 47 on March 31, 2006, the Company recorded an after tax charge of $2.5 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Net Earnings Net earnings were $123.6 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. Pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the preferred stock of National Welders, until June 30, 2009, the preferred stockholders have the option to exchange their 3.2 million shares of National Welders voting redeemable preferred stock either for cash at a price of $17.78 per share or to tender them to the joint venture in exchange for approximately 2.3 million shares of Airgas common stock. If Airgas common stock has a market value of $24.45 per share, the stock and cash redemption options are equivalent. The weighted shares used in the fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share calculation include the assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock. In fiscal 2005, the conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock was anti dilutive. Also see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. 33 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2007 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $318 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $352 million in fiscal 2006. Net earnings adjusted for non cash items provided cash of $384 million versus $304 million in the prior year. Working capital resulted in a use of cash of $86 million versus a use of $8 million in the prior year. The use of cash for working capital in fiscal 2007 principally reflects a higher level of trade receivables associated with sales growth, a higher level of income tax payments, and the timing of payments to vendors. The Company also increased the amount of receivables sold under its trade receivables securitization program providing cash of $20 million in the current year versus $54 million in the prior year. Cash flows of National Welders, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders to the Company, are not available to the Company. Cash provided by operating activities in the current year included $34 million of cash provided by National Welders versus $23 million in the prior year. Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were used to fund investing activities, such as capital expenditures and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 totaled $923 million and primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash of $688 million was paid in the current year for 13 acquisitions, including the acquisition of Lindes bulk gas business, and holdback settlements. Capital expenditures were $244 million in the current period (including $18 million at National Welders). Capital expenditures reflect investments to support the Companys sales growth initiatives. For example, investments in rental welders by the Companys Red D Arc subsidiary supported its fiscal 2007 same store sales growth of 33%. The Company has also continued to invest in its core business through purchasing cylinders and bulk tanks. Other significant investments included a new carbon dioxide plant and fill plant expansions. The Company expects that fiscal 2008 capital expenditures will approximate 7% of net sales. Financing activities provided net cash of $596 million primarily from net borrowings under the Companys Credit Facility. The additional borrowing was principally used to fund acquisitions. Other sources of cash effectively offset the use of cash within financing activities. Dividends During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07, $0.06 and $0.045 per share, respectively. On May 8, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, which is payable on June 29, 2007 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2007. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. Stock Repurchase Plan Due to certain contemplated acquisitions, in July 2006, the Company suspended the three year share repurchase plan that it initiated in November 2005. No shares of Company common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2007. Since inception, 195,400 shares have been repurchased under the plan and $137.2 million of the original $150 million authorization remains available. The Company continues to focus on using its cash flow for investing in growth opportunities, including future acquisitions, paying down debt and growing its dividend. 34 Table of Contents Financial Instruments Debt Refinancing Effective July 25, 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Subject to compliance with certain covenants, the $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility) permits the Company to borrow up to $966 million under a U.S. dollar revolving credit line, up to C$40 million (U.S. $34 million) under a Canadian dollar revolving credit line and up to $600 million under two or more term loans. The Company used borrowings under the term loan provision of the Credit Facility to finance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006. The remaining $500 million term loan was used to finance the previously announced Linde bulk gas acquisition that closed on March 9, 2007. The Credit Facility will mature on July 25, 2011. As of March 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $1,067 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility: $471 million under the U.S. dollar revolver, C$22 million (U.S. $18 million) under the Canadian dollar revolver and a $578 million under the term loan. The term loans are repayable in quarterly installments of $22.5 million between March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2010. The quarterly installments then increase to $71.2 million from September 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011. The Company also had letters of credit of $34 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The U.S. dollar borrowings and the term loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points and the Canadian dollar borrowings bear interest at the Canadian Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 75 basis points. As of March 31, 2007, the effective interest rates on the U.S. dollar borrowings, the term loans and the Canadian dollar borrowings were 6.09%, 6.10%and 5.20%, respectively. The Companys domestic subsidiaries, exclusive of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity (the domestic guarantors), guarantee the U.S. and Canadian borrowings. The Canadian borrowings are also guaranteed by the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees are full and unconditional and are made on a joint and several basis. The Company has pledged 100% of the stock of its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries as surety for its obligations under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for the release of the guarantees and collateral if the Company attains an investment grade credit rating and a similar release on all other debt. Total Borrowing Capacity and Acquisition Financing At March 31, 2007, approximately $461 million remained unused under the U.S. dollar revolving credit line and approximately C$18 million (U.S. $16 million) remained unused under the Canadian dollar revolving credit line. As of March 31, 2007, the financial covenants of the Credit Facility permitted the Company increase its total borrowings under the Credit Facility or through other debt instruments by approximately $538 million. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment and breach of covenants. In the event of default, repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility may be accelerated. The Company continues to look for acquisition candidates. The financial covenant calculations of the Credit Facility include the pro forma results of acquired businesses. Therefore, total borrowing capacity is not reduced dollar for dollar with acquisition financing. The Company intends to finance the pending acquisition (purchase price of $310 million) of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde AG with borrowings under the revolving credit line of the Credit Facility. A portion of the business to be acquired will be sold by the Company to National Welders. National Welders will secure financing necessary to acquire their portion of the business. The Company believes that it could obtain financing on reasonable terms if its requirements exceed amounts available under the Credit Facility. The terms of any future financing arrangements depend on market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time. 35 Table of Contents Money Market Loan The Company has an agreement with a financial institution that provides access to short term advances not to exceed $30 million for a maximum term of three months. The agreement expires on November 30, 2007, but may be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March 31, 2007, the Company had an outstanding advance under the agreement of $30 million for a term of 90 days bearing interest at 5.75%. Senior Subordinated Notes At March 31, 2007, the Company had $150 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2004 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of July 15, 2014. The 2004 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2004 Notes have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2004 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is July 15, 2009 at a price of 103.125% of the principal amount. The 2004 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The 2004 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the Credit Facility. The stock of the Companys domestic subsidiaries is also pledged to the note holders on a subordinated basis. On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes in full at a premium of 104.563% of the principal amount with proceeds from the Companys revolving credit line. In conjunction with the redemption of the Notes, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax) in October 2006. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long term debt also included acquisition and other notes principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2007, acquisition and other notes totaled approximately $17 million with interest rates ranging from 4% to 8.5%. Financial Instruments of the National Welders Joint Venture Pursuant to the requirements of the FASBs Financial Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R), the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2007 and 2006 include the financial obligations of National Welders. National Welders financial obligations are non recourse to the Company, meaning that the creditors of National Welders do not have a claim on the assets of Airgas, Inc. The National Welders Credit Agreement (the NWS Credit Agreement) provides for a revolving credit line of $100 million, a Term Loan A of $26 million, a Term Loan B of $21 million, and a Term Loan C of $9 million. At March 31, 2007, National Welders had borrowings under its revolving credit line of $73 million and under Term Loan A of $12 million. There were no amounts outstanding under Term loans B or C at March 31, 2007. National Welders also had $681 thousand in acquisition notes and other debt obligations. 36 Table of Contents The NWS revolving credit borrowings mature in August 2009. Term Loan A is repayable in monthly amounts of $254 thousand plus accrued interest with a lump sum payment of the outstanding balance at maturity in March 2011. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit line and Term Loan A ranges from LIBOR plus 70 to 145 basis points varying with National Welders leverage ratio. At March 31, 2007, the effective interest rate for the revolving credit line and Term Loan A was 6.02%. The NWS Credit Agreement also contains certain covenants which, among other things, subject National Welders to minimum net worth requirements, limit the ability of National Welders to incur and guarantee new indebtedness, and limit its capital expenditures, ownership changes, merger and acquisition activity, and the payment of dividends. National Welders had additional borrowing capacity under the NWS Credit Agreement of approximately $27 million at March 31, 2007. Term Loans B and C were previously repaid and provide no additional borrowing capacity. As of March 31, 2007, the revolving credit line and Term Loan A are secured by certain current assets, principally trade receivables and inventory, totaling $38 million, non current assets, principally equipment, totaling $119 million, and Airgas common stock with a market value of $39 million classified as treasury stock and carried at cost of $370 thousand. Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. During fiscal 2007, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $2.70 billion of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $2.68 billion in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $264 million at March 31, 2007 and $244 million at March 31, 2006. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. At March 31, 2007, the Company had six fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $150 million. These swaps effectively convert $150 million of variable interest rate debt associated with the Companys Credit Facility to fixed rate debt. At March 31, 2007, two swap agreements with a total notional amount of $50 million required the Company to make fixed interest payments based on a weighted average effective rate of 4.15% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on a weighted average variable rate of 5.32%. The four other swap agreements with a total notional amount of $100 million required the Company to make fixed interest payments based on a weighted average effective rate of 5.39% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on a weighted average variable rate of 5.35%. The remaining terms of each of these swap agreements are between 15 months to 26 months. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties. National Welders was a party to one interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution with a notional principal amount of $27 million. National Welders is required to make fixed interest payments of 5.36% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparty based on one month LIBOR, which was 5.36% at March 31, 2007. The remaining term of the swap agreement is 26 months. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements, the debt of National Welders, and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2007 was 21% fixed to 79% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over LIBOR. Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $3 million. 37 Table of Contents OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets and business insurance reserves. Uncertainties about future events make these estimates susceptible to change. Management evaluates these estimates regularly and believes they are the best estimates, appropriately made, given the known facts and circumstances. For the three years ended March 31, 2007, there were no material changes in the valuation methods or assumptions used by management. However, actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are critical due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for these matters, their susceptibility to change and the potential impact that different assumptions could have on operating performance. Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes sales returns, sales allowances, and bad debts. The allowance adjusts the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on estimates of accounts that will not ultimately be collected. An allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established as trade receivables age beyond their due date. As past due balances age, higher valuation allowances are established lowering the net carrying value of receivables. The amount of valuation allowance established for each past due period reflects the Companys historical collections experience and current economic conditions and trends. The Company also establishes valuation allowances for specific problem accounts and bankruptcies. The amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions, the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions, the financial condition of individual customers, and the terms of reorganization for accounts emerging from bankruptcy. Changes in these conditions impact the Companys collection experience and may result in the recognition of higher or lower valuation allowances. Management evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company has a low concentration of credit risk due to its broad and diversified customer base across multiple industries and geographic locations, and its relatively low average order size. No individual customer accounts for more than 0.5% of the Companys annual sales. Historically, the Companys sales returns, sales allowances, and bad debts have been in the range of 1.4% to 1.7% of sales. Inventories The Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of the products the Company carries in inventory have long shelf lives and are not subject to technological obsolescence. The Company writes its inventory down to its estimated market value when it believes the market value is below cost. The Company estimates its ability to recover the costs of items in inventory by product type based on its age, the rate at which that product line is turning in inventory, its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The ability of the Company to recover its cost for products in inventory can be affected by factors such as future customer demand, general market conditions and the relationship with significant suppliers. Management evaluates the recoverability of its inventory at least quarterly. In aggregate, inventory turns approximately four times per year. 38 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October 31 of each year or whenever indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value. Implied fair value is estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis for each reporting unit. The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. The Companys analysis uses internally generated budgets and long range forecasts, which are the same budgets and forecasts used for managing operations, awarding management bonuses and seeking alternative or additional financing. The Companys discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in these budgets and forecasts about sales trends, inflation, working capital needs, and forecasted capital expenditures along with an estimate of the reporting units terminal value (the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period) to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys assumptions about working capital needs and capital expenditures are based on historical experience. Terminal values reflect an assumed perpetual growth rate consistent with long term expectations for inflation. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows is a risk adjusted rate consistent with the weighted average cost of capital of peer group companies for a term equal to the forecast period. The Company believes the assumptions used in its discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, the Company may not meet its sales growth and profitability targets, working capital needs and capital expenditures may be higher than forecast, changes in credit markets may result in changes to the Companys discount rate and general business conditions may result in changes to the Companys terminal value assumptions for its reporting units. Based on the October 31, 2006 assessment, the Company does not expect that such changes would result in the recognition of goodwill impairment in the Companys reporting units. Business Insurance Reserves The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile, and general liability claims. During fiscal 2007, these programs had self insured retention of $1 million per occurrence. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Companys self insured retention was $500 thousand per occurrence with an additional aggregate retention of $2.2 million in fiscal 2006 and $1.7 million in fiscal 2005, for claims in excess of $500 thousand. For fiscal 2008, the self insured retention will remain $1 million per occurrence with no additional aggregate retention. The Company reserves for its self insured retention based on individual claim evaluations performed by a qualified third party administrator. The third party administrator establishes loss estimates for known claims based on the current facts and circumstances. These known claims are then developed, through actuarial computations, to reflect the expected ultimate loss for the known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Actuarial computations use the Companys specific loss history, payment patterns, insurance coverage, plus industry trends and other factors to estimate the required reserve for all open claims by policy year and loss type. Reserves for the Companys self insurance retention are evaluated monthly. Semi annually, the Company obtains a third party actuarial report to validate that the computations and assumptions used are consistent with actuarial standards. Certain assumptions used in the actuarial computations are susceptible to change. Loss development factors are influenced by items such as medical inflation, changes in workers compensation laws, and changes in the Companys loss payment patterns, all of which can have a significant influence on the estimated ultimate loss related to the Companys self insured retention. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of open claims may be for amounts more or less than the reserve balances. The Companys operations are spread across a significant number of locations, which helps to mitigate the potential impact of any given event that could give rise to an insurance related loss. Over the last three years, business insurance expense has generally been in the range of 0.8% to 0.9% of sales. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table presents the Companys contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Less than 1 More than 5 Contractual and Off Balance Sheet Obligations Total Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years Years Obligations reflected on the March 31, 2007 Balance Sheet: Long term debt (1) $ 1,350,015 $ 40,296 $ 268,753 $ 889,186 $ 151,780 Estimated interest payments on long term debt (2) 313,849 80,624 137,900 85,225 9,675 Estimated payments (receipts) on interest rate swap agreements (3) (1,200 ) (500 ) (700 ) Off balance sheet obligations as of March 31, 2007: Operating leases (4) 212,889 59,757 90,817 49,546 12,769 Trade receivables securitization (5) 264,400 264,400 Estimated discount on securitization (6) 44,814 14,938 29,876 Letters of credit (7) 34,426 34,426 Purchase obligations: Liquid bulk gas supply agreements (8) 808,021 89,015 165,716 158,750 394,540 Liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements (9) 180,072 15,981 23,700 17,851 122,540 Ammonia supply agreements (10) 87,557 18,469 34,544 34,544 Other purchase commitments (11) 43,996 17,121 11,562 7,983 7,330 Construction commitments (12) 64,974 44,810 20,164 Total $ 3,403,813 $ 413,483 $ 1,046,732 $ 1,163,710 $ 698,634 (1) The less than one year relates to obligations due in fiscal 2008. The 1 to 3 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010. The 3 to 5 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2012. The more than 5 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and beyond. Aggregate long term debt instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2007. Long term debt includes capital lease obligations, which were not material and, therefore, did not warrant separate disclosure. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding long term debt instruments. (2) The future interest payments on the Companys long term debt obligations were estimated based on the current outstanding principal reduced by scheduled maturities in each period presented and interest rates 40 Table of Contents as of March 31, 2007. The estimated interest payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of long term debt outstanding and actual interest rates in future periods. (3) Payments or receipts under interest rate swap agreements result from changes in market interest rates compared to contractual rates and payments to be exchanged between the parties to the agreements. The estimated receipts in future periods were determined based on interest rates as of March 31, 2007. Actual receipts or payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual interest rates in future periods. (4) The Companys operating leases include approximately $140 million in fleet vehicles under long term operating leases. The Company guarantees a residual value of $18 million related to its leased vehicles. (5) The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. Under the securitization agreement, on a monthly basis, trade receivables are sold to three commercial banks through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Proceeds received from the sale of receivables were used by the Company to reduce its borrowings under its Credit Facility. The securitization agreement is a form of off balance sheet financing. Also see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (6) The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market interest rates. The estimated discount in future periods is based on receivables sold and interest rates as of March 31, 2007. The actual discount recognized in future periods may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of receivables sold and market rates. (7) Letters of credit are guarantees of payment to third parties. The Companys letters of credit principally back obligations associated with the Companys self insured retention on workers compensation, automobile and general liability claims. The letters of credit are supported by the Companys Credit Facility. (8) In addition to the gas volumes supplied by the recently formed Airgas Merchant Gases, the Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases. The Company has a long term take or pay supply agreement, in effect through September 1, 2017, under which Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) will supply at least 35% of the Companys bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon requirements, exclusive of the volumes produced by the Company and those purchased under the Linde supply agreements noted below. Additionally, the Company purchases helium under the terms of the supply agreement. Based on the volume of fiscal 2007 purchases, the Air Products supply agreement represents approximately $50 million annually in liquid bulk gas purchases. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2007 purchases. The Company and Linde AG as successor to BOC entered into a long term take or pay supply agreement to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon. The agreement will expire in July 2019 and represents approximately $3 million in annual bulk gas purchases. In September and October 2006, the Company and Linde AG entered into a long term take or pay supply agreements to purchase helium. The total annual commitment amount under the Linde agreements is approximately $28 million. The Company also participates in a long term agreement with Praxair to swap production of bulk nitrogen, oxygen, and argon through 2014. The Praxair agreement represents approximately $7 million annually. 41 Table of Contents The supply agreements above contain periodic adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analysis. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. (9) The Company is a party to long term take or pay supply agreements for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide. The aggregate obligations under the supply agreements represent approximately 20% of the Companys annual carbon dioxide requirements. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2007 purchases. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the carbon dioxide supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. Certain of the liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements contain market pricing subject to certain economic indices. (10) The Company purchases ammonia from a variety of sources. With one of those sources, the Company has minimum purchase commitments under supply agreements, which is perpetual pending a 180 day written notification of termination from either party. (11) Other purchase commitments primarily include property, plant and equipment expenditures. (12) Construction commitments represent outstanding commitments to customers to build and operate air separation plants in Carrollton, KY and New Carlisle, IN. The projects are expected to begin operating in the spring of 2009. 42 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. SFAS 155 addresses the application of SFAS 133 to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. SFAS 155 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 155 and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. SFAS 156 requires that an entity recognize a servicing asset or liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a service contract under certain situations. SFAS 156 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 156 and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued EITF No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement. EITF 06 3 requires companies to disclose the presentation of any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer (e.g. sales and use tax) as either gross or net in the accounting principles included in the notes to the financial statements. EITF 06 3 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will disclose its policy when EITF 06 3 is adopted. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions in an enterprises financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date in order to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the provisions of FIN 48 will be applied to all tax positions accounted for under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, upon initial adoption. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company has not completed its final assessment of the impact of FIN 48, but adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies to the fair value requirements as applicable in other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 157 and has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February of 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 159 and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements. 43 Table of Contents Forward looking Statements This report contains statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Companys borrowing agreements. Interest rate swap agreements are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company has not, and will not establish any interest risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources. The Company maintains the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt within parameters established by management under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Including the effect of interest rate swap agreements on the Companys debt and off balance sheet financing agreements, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt was 21% to 79% at March 31, 2007. The ratio includes the effect of the fixed and variable rate debt of National Welders. Counterparties to interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long term credit ratings of A or better. In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non performance by the counterparties. The table below summarizes the Companys market risks associated with long term debt obligations, interest rate swaps and LIBOR based agreements as of March 31, 2007. For long term debt obligations, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate swaps and LIBOR based agreements, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period. 45 Table of Contents Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Fixed Rate Debt Acquisition and other notes $ 6 $ 5 $ 4 $ $ $ 2 $ 17 $ 17 Interest expense $ 0.9 $ 0.6 $ 0.3 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 2.2 Average interest rate 5.59 % 5.65 % 5.32 % 5.32 % 4.99 % 4.99 % Senior subordinated notes due 2014 $ $ $ $ $ $ 150 $ 150 $ 146 Interest expense $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 19 $ 64 Interest rate 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % National Welders: Acquisition and other notes $ 0.7 $ $ $ $ $ $ 0.7 $ .07 Interest expense $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Interest rate 7.00 % Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Variable Rate Debt Revolving credit facilities $ $ $ $ $ 489 $ $ 489 $ 489 Interest expense $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 10 $ $ 130 Interest rate (a) 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % Term loan $ $ 90 $ 90 $ 236 $ 162 $ $ 578 $ 578 Interest expense $ 34 $ 28 $ 23 $ 15 $ 2 $ $ 102 Interest rate (a) 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % Money market loans $ 30 $ $ $ $ $ $ 30 $ 30 Interest expense $ 1.2 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1.2 Interest rate (a) 5.75 % National Welders: Revolving credit facility $ $ $ 73 $ $ $ $ 73 $ 73 Interest expense $ 4.4 $ 4.4 $ 1.8 $ $ $ $ 10.6 Interest rate (a) 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % Term loan A $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ $ $ 12 $ 12 Interest expense $ 0.7 $ 0.6 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 $ $ $ 2.0 Interest rate (a) 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % 46 Table of Contents Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Interest Rate Swaps: 6 Swaps (Receive Variable)/Pay Fixed Notional amounts $ $ 100 $ 50 $ $ $ $ 150 $ (.04 ) Swap payments/(receipts) $ (0.5 ) $ (0.6 ) $ (0.1 ) $ $ $ $ (1.2 ) $100 million notional amount Variable Receive rate 5.35% Weighted average pay rate 5.39% $50 million notional amount Variable Receive rate 5.32% Weighted average pay rate 4.15% National Welders: 1 Swap (Receive Variable)/Pay Fixed Notional amounts $ $ $ 27 $ $ $ $ 27 $ Variable Receive rate 5.35% $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Weighted average pay rate 5.36% Other Off Balance Sheet LIBOR based agreements: Trade receivable securitization (b) $ $ $ 264 $ $ $ $ 264 $ 264 Discount on securitization $ 15 $ 15 $ 15 $ $ $ $ 45 (a) The variable rate of U.S. Credit Facility and term loan is based on LIBOR as of March 31, 2007.

(b) The trade receivables securitization agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. Limitations of the tabular presentation As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March 31, 2007, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Companys credit rating. Foreign Currency Rate Risk Canadian subsidiaries of the Company are funded with local currency debt. The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 47 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2006 include an after tax charge of $2.5 million as a result of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, an after tax loss of $1.9 million on the divestiture of Rutland Tool, which was reported as a discontinued operation, and an estimated loss of $2.2 million ($1.4 million after tax) related to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Working capital decreased in fiscal 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in the current portion of long term debt. (3) As discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2005 include integration costs related to the acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. and employee separation costs of $6.4 million ($4 million after tax). Fiscal 2005 also reflected a full year of National Welders as a consolidated affiliate. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for the effect of the consolidation of National Welders on the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) The results for fiscal 2004 include a fourth quarter special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax) reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. Fiscal 2004 results also include the fourth quarter consolidation of the National Welders joint venture in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R). Prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company used the Equity Method of Accounting for its investment in National Welders. Accordingly, the consolidation of National Welders under FIN 46R did not have an impact on the Companys net earnings. (5) The results for fiscal 2003 include special charges of $2.7 million ($2.1 million after tax) consisting of a restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products Chemicals, Inc. (6) During fiscal 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07, $0.06, $0.045 and $0.04 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 8, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share payable June 29, 2007 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2007. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. (7) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications reflect the presentation of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. 20 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Item 7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 OVERVIEW Airgas, Inc. (the Company) had net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (fiscal 2007 or current year) of $3.20 billion compared to $2.83 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006 or prior year). Net sales increased by 13% driven by strong same store sales growth and the impact of acquisitions. Same store sales growth contributed 8% to the increase in total sales. Same store sales growth was driven equally by pricing initiatives and higher sales volumes. Price increases were initiated in response to rising product, operating and distribution costs. Higher sales volumes resulted from the continued strength of the industrial economy, the non residential construction environment, and the continued success of the Companys growth initiatives. Acquisitions continue to be an important component of the Companys growth contributing 5% to the overall increase in net sales. Operating income margin expanded 120 basis points in the current year to 10.7% compared to 9.5% in the prior year reflecting continued operating leverage. Solid sales growth and operating expense discipline resulted in income from continuing operations of $154.4 million or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share in fiscal 2006. Accounting Change Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective method. The new standard requires the Company to estimate the value of stock options issued to employees, including options to purchase shares under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and recognize stock based compensation expense over the period in which the options vest. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company used the intrinsic value method outlined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 to account for stock based compensation. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $15.4 million ($10.9 million after tax) or $0.13 per diluted share. Since the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, no stock based compensation expense was reflected in earnings prior to April 1, 2006. Financing Effective July 25, 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Subject to compliance with certain covenants, the $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility) permits the Company to borrow up to $966 million under a U.S. dollar revolving credit line, up to C$40 million (U.S. $34 million) under a Canadian dollar revolving credit line and up to $600 million under two or more term loans. The Company used borrowings under the term loan provision of the Credit Facility to finance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006 and the remaining $500 million for the Linde bulk gas acquisition that closed on March 9, 2007. The Credit Facility matures on July 25, 2011. On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes due October 1, 2011 (the Notes) at a premium of 104.563% of the principal amount with borrowing under the Companys Credit Facility. In conjunction with the redemption of the Notes, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax), or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 21 Table of Contents Acquisitions During fiscal 2007, the Company completed 13 acquisitions with combined annual sales of approximately $336 million. The largest of these acquisitions include the September 2006 purchase of Houston, Texas based Aeriform Corporation, a distributor of industrial gases and related hardgoods. Aeriform, with 29 locations and 240 employees in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas, generated annual revenue of $65 million. In November 2006, the Company purchased the Union Industrial Gas Group, a distributor of industrial gases and related hardgoods. The Union Industrial Gas Group, with 14 locations and 100 employees in New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana, had annual revenue of $38 million. In January 2007, the Company purchased CFC Refimax, a leading full service refrigerant supplier and reclamation company. CFC Refimax, based in Atlanta, Georgia with 50 employees, generated annual revenue of $19 million. In March 2007, the Company acquired Lindes divested U.S. bulk gas assets. The Linde bulk gas business, consisting of eight air separation units (ASUs) and 300 employees, produced annual revenue of $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. With the acquisition of the Linde bulk gas business, the Company formed a new business unit, Airgas Merchant Gases, to manage production, distribution and administrative functions for seven of the air separation plants. One air separation plant and its aligned sales was transferred to the Companys National Welders joint venture. In connection with the transaction, most of the acquired bulk gas customers and related service equipment was transfered to existing Distribution business units. Airgas Merchant Gases principally operates as an internal supplier of bulk oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the business units in the Distribution business segment. Pending Acquisition On March 29, 2007, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire, for $310 million in cash, a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde AG. The operations to be acquired include branches, warehouses, packaged gas fill plants, and other operations involved in distributing packaged industrial and specialty gases and related hardgoods. The business includes 130 locations in 18 states, with more than 1,400 employees, which generated $346 million in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately 50 percent of the revenue was from gas sales and cylinder rent, with the remainder from sales of welding equipment and supplies. The acquisition will be financed under the Companys Credit Facility. Looking Forward The Company anticipates that fiscal 2008 will be another productive year. The Company expects further expansion of the industrial economy during fiscal 2008 and estimates fiscal 2008 net earnings to be between $2.33 to $2.41 per diluted share. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company estimates that it will earn between $0.52 to $0.54 per diluted share. The estimate of fiscal 2008 net earnings anticipates a supportive sales environment and continued success of pricing actions designed to offset rising costs. The annual earnings guidance does not reflect anticipated earnings from the pending acquisition of Lindes U.S. packaged gas business. In accordance with the Companys standard practice, the earnings guidance, noted above, does not reflect any impact from acquisitions that have not closed at the time the guidance is issued. However, the acquired Linde business, net of integration costs, is expected to be slightly accretive in the first twelve months of operation. 22 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 13% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 driven by strong same store sales growth of 8% and acquisition growth of 5%. Same store sales growth reflected pricing initiatives, volume growth, and strategic product sales gains, driven by the continued strength of the industrial production, energy and non residential construction markets served by the Company. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. Net Sales (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 2,691,814 $ 2,395,938 $ 295,876 12 % All Other Operations 579,671 493,430 86,241 17 % Intercompany eliminations (66,434 ) (59,758 ) (6,676 ) $ 3,205,051 $ 2,829,610 $ 375,441 13 % The Distribution segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases; cylinder and equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, and maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) supplies. Distribution segment sales increased 12% compared to the prior year driven by same store sales growth of $200 million (8%) and sales contributed by both current and prior year acquisitions of $96 million. The increase in Distribution same store sales resulted from higher hardgoods sales of $82 million (8%) and gas and rent sales growth of $105 million (8%). Broad demand from industrial, energy infrastructure and non residential construction sectors helped the Companys core gas and welding hardgoods business. Several of the Companys business units reported double digit growth. Sales growth was also driven by double digit growth of strategic products sales. Strategic products are identified by the Company as those expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall industrial economy and include safety products, medical, specialty, and bulk gases, as well as carbon dioxide products, such as dry ice. Accordingly, the Company has initiatives focused on promoting these products. Approximately 75% of the Distribution segments $96 million sales growth contributed by acquisitions was the result of current year acquisitions. Current year acquisitions attributable to the Distribution segment historically generated annual revenue of approximately $300 million. The largest of the current year acquisitions closed in the second half of the fiscal year, with the Linde bulk gas acquisition closing in March 2007. Fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to contribute more than $200 million to the Distribution segments sales growth in fiscal 2008. Additionally as noted in the overview section above, the pending acquisition of a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde, with annual revenues of $346 million, approximately $50 million of which will be acquired by the Companys joint venture National Welders (which is accounted for in the All Other Operations segment), should also be a significant contributor to fiscal 2008 sales growth. The Distribution segments gas and rent same store sales of 8% reflects both price increases and volume growth. The impact of price increases reflects pricing actions implemented in June 2006 and November 2005. Sales of industrial gases during the current year remained strong reflecting demand from the Companys core industrial markets. Sales of strategic gas products increased 11% in the current 23 Table of Contents year driven by bulk, medical and specialty gas sales gains. Bulk gas sales volumes were up related to growth in micro bulk and the signing of new bulk customer contracts. Medical gas sales growth was attributable to higher demand from the hospital sector as well as success of the Walk O2 Bout medical cylinder program. Rental revenues benefited from the Companys rental welder business that generated 33% same store sales growth in the current year. The rebuilding effort in the Gulf Coast area, power plant construction projects and the strong non residential construction market contributed to the increase in demand for welding machines, gases and consumables. Hardgoods same store sales growth reflects continued volume and pricing gains. The Companys successful Radnor private label brand of products generated sales growth of 11% in the current year, reaching a total of $128 million. Same store sales of safety products increased 10% reflecting the success of the telemarketing operations (telesales) and effective cross selling of safety products to new and existing customers. The All Other Operations segment consists of the Companys Gas Operations Division, Airgas Merchant Gases and the National Welders joint venture. The Gas Operations Division produces and distributes certain gas products, principally carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, specialty gases, anhydrous ammonia and related supplies, services and equipment. Airgas Merchant Gases was formed with the acquisition of the Linde bulk gas business to manage production, distribution and administrative functions for the acquired air separation plants. National Welders is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods based in Charlotte, North Carolina. All Other Operations sales increased $86 million (17%) compared to the prior year resulting from same store sales growth and acquisitions. Same store sales growth of 8% was driven by continued sales gains of National Welders and growth in carbon dioxide products. Sales of dry ice and liquid carbon dioxide were strong contributors to sales growth in the current year reflecting success in the food processing and industrial carbon dioxide markets and the Companys nationwide network of Penguin dry ice retail locations. Sales growth from acquisitions primarily reflects a prior year acquisition of a packaged gas distributor by National Welders. Current year acquisitions reflected in the All Other Operations business segment include CFC Refimax, and the Linde bulk gas business. Current year acquisitions did not significantly impact the current years sales growth as they closed in the fourth quarter. However, the fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to have a significant impact on the All Other Operations sales growth in fiscal 2008. The most significant contributor to the All Other Operations sales growth will be Airgas Merchant Gases. However, Airgas Merchant Gases will principally be a wholesale supplier to the business units in the Distribution business segment. Therefore, the sales of Airgas Merchant Gases to the Distrubution segment will be eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Third party sales from the fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to contribute approximately $55 million to fiscal 2008 sales growth. As noted above, upon closing the pending acquisition of a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde, operations with approximately $50 million in annual revenue would be acquired by the Companys National Welders joint venture, also contributing to the fiscal 2008 sales growth. Gross Profits Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. As disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company reflects distribution costs as elements of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment on the income statement line item Depreciation. Other companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their Cost of Products Sold, and as such the Companys gross profits discussed below may not be comparable to those of other entities. 24 Table of Contents Gross profits increased 15% principally from sales growth and acquisitions. The gross margin in the current period was 51.1% compared to 50.5% in the prior year period. Gross Profit (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 1,336,447 $ 1,172,503 $ 163,944 14 % All Other Operations 301,514 255,129 46,385 18 % $ 1,637,961 $ 1,427,632 $ 210,329 15 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $164 million (14%) compared to the prior year. The Distribution segments gross margin was 49.6% versus 48.9% in the prior year. The increase in the gross margin of 70 basis points reflected the impact of price increases as well as a favorable shift in product mix toward and within gas and rent. Gas and rent as a percentage of the Distribution segments sales was 52.0% in the current year as compared to 51.7% in the prior year. The All Other Operations segments gross profits increased $46 million (18%) primarily from strong sales growth at National Welders and sales volume growth of carbon dioxide products. The segments gross margin increased 30 basis points to 52.0% versus 51.7% in the prior year period driven by improvement in pricing and margin expansion particularly with respect to the anhydrous ammonia product line acquired in June 2005. Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SDA) consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SDA expense decreased 50 basis points to 35.9% compared to 36.4% in the prior year reflecting improved cost leverage and effective cost management. The decrease in SDA expense as a percentage of sales occurred despite $15.4 million or approximately 50 basis points of stock based compensation expense in the current year (as described in the Overview section above). There was no stock based compensation expense in the prior year. SDA expenses increased $118 million (11%) primarily from higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes and the operating costs of acquired businesses. Acquisitions contributed estimated incremental SDA expenses of approximately $30 million in the current year. The increase in SDA expense attributable to factors other than stock based compensation and acquisitions was approximately $72 million or an increase of 7% primarily attributable to salaries and wages and distribution related expenses The increase in salaries and wages reflected increased operational headcounts and overtime to fill cylinders, deliver products and operate facilities to meet increased customer demand. The increase in distribution expenses was attributable to higher fuel and vehicle repair and maintenance costs, which were up approximately $12 million versus the prior year. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise in diesel fuel prices over the past year and the increase in miles driven to support related sales growth . Operating expenses in the prior year include $2.2 million associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Depreciation expense of $139 million increased $16 million (13%) compared to the prior year. Acquired businesses contributed depreciation expense of approximately $3.3 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the current and prior years capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand, primarily cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders, as well as the addition of new fill plants and branch stores. Amortization expense of $8.5 million was $3.4 million higher than the prior year period driven by the amortization of customer lists and non compete agreements associated with acquisitions. 25 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income increased 27% in the current year driven by higher sales levels and margin improvement. Improved cost leverage on sales growth was the primary contributor to a 120 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 10.7% compared to 9.5% in the prior year. Operating Income (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 266,708 $ 208,466 $ 58,242 28 % All Other Operations 74,744 60,292 14,452 24 % $ 341,452 $ 268,758 $ 72,694 27 % Operating income in the Distribution segment increased 28% in the current year. The Distribution segments operating margin increased 120 basis points to 9.9% compared to 8.7% in the prior year. The significant margin improvement was driven by continued operating profit leverage on sales growth and effective management of costs and pricing. Operating income in the All Other Operations segment increased 24% compared to the prior year. The segments operating income margin of 12.9% was 70 basis points higher than 12.2% in the prior year. The increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the strong business momentum of National Welders and the improved anhydrous ammonia business. The acquired Linde bulk gas business is expected to improve the Companys consolidated fiscal 2008 operating income and operating margin. The newly formed Airgas Merchant Gases, accounted for in the All Other Operations segment, will principally act as an internal wholesale supplier to the Distribution segment business units. The business units in the Distribution segment will manage the customer relationships and bill the new bulk gas customers. Since the end customer is served by the Distribution segment companies, the improved operating margin will principally be reflected in the Distribution business segment. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $74 million representing an increase of 17% compared to the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from higher average debt levels associated with acquisitions, a larger securitization program and higher weighted average interest rates related to the Companys variable rate debt instruments, partially offset by the current year refinancing of higher fixed rate debt. In July 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Facility expanded the Companys borrowing capacity, subject to compliance with certain covenants, to $1.6 billion principally at an effective interest rate of LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The Company used the Credit Facility to refinance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006. Additionally, on October 27, 2006, the Company used the Credit Facility to redeem its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes. Based on current interest rates under the revolving credit facility, interest savings from these refinancings are estimated to be $700 thousand per month. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $264 million at March 31, 2007 versus $244 million at March 31, 2006. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. 26 Table of Contents As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2007 was 21% fixed to 79% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $3 million. Loss on Debt Extinguishment On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes at a premium of 104.563% with borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company recognized a third quarter charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax) or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.8% of pre tax earnings in the current year compared to 37.4% in the prior year. The effective income tax rate in the current year reflects a one time tax benefit associated with changes in state income tax law in Texas. Additionally, the current years tax rate reflects the limited deductibility of stock based compensation associated with the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the absence of state tax benefits associated with the loss on the extinguishment of debt. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2006 reflected favorable changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and a favorable adjustment to previously recorded tax liabilities. The Company expects the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 to range from 39% to 39.5% of pre tax earnings. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations in the current year was $154 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, which reflects an after tax loss of $7.9 million from the early extinguishment of debt, or $0.10 per diluted share, stock based compensation expense of $10.9 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share, and $1.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, one time tax benefit associated with changes in state income tax law. Income from continuing operations in the prior period was $128 million, or $1.62 per diluted share. Stock based compensation expense was not recognized in the prior year. Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations In December 2005, the Company divested its business unit Rutland Tool Supply Co., Inc. (Rutland Tool). Consequently, the operating results of Rutland Tool for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are reflected as discontinued operations. For fiscal 2006, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. 27 Table of Contents Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Effective March 31, 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, (FIN 47), and recorded a $2.5 million after tax charge ($0.03 per diluted share) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Net Earnings Net earnings were $154.4 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $123.6 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in the prior year. Pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the preferred stock of National Welders, until June 30, 2009, the preferred stockholders have the option to exchange their 3.2 million shares of National Welders voting redeemable preferred stock either for cash at a price of $17.78 per share or to tender them to the joint venture in exchange for approximately 2.3 million shares of Airgas common stock. If Airgas common stock has a market value of $24.45 per share, the stock and cash redemption options are equivalent. The weighted shares used in the fiscal 2007 and 2006 diluted earnings per share calculations include the assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock. Also see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. 28 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 OVERVIEW The Company had net sales for fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006) of $2.83 billion compared to $2.37 billion for fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005). Net sales increased by 20% driven by strong same store sales growth and the impact of acquisitions. Same store sales growth contributed 11% to the increase in total sales. Acquisitions contributed 9% to the overall increase in net sales. The operating income margin expanded 90 basis points in fiscal 2006 to 9.5% compared to 8.6% in fiscal 2005 reflecting improving cost leverage. Solid sales growth and operating expense discipline resulted in income from continuing operations of $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to $91.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005, a 36% increase. Accounting Change Effective March 31, 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, (FIN 47), and recorded a $2.5 million after tax charge ($0.03 per diluted share) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Discontinued Operations On December 1, 2005, the Company divested its subsidiary, Rutland Tool. Rutland Tool distributed metalworking tools, machine tools and MRO supplies from seven locations and had approximately 180 employees. Rutland Tool generated annual sales of approximately $50 million and an insignificant amount of operating income. As a result of the divestiture, the Company reflected fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 operating results of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. The fiscal 2006 loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. Proceeds from the divestiture were approximately $15 million. The operating results of Rutland Tool were previously reflected in the Distribution business segment. Acquisitions During fiscal 2006, the Company completed 13 acquisitions (including three businesses acquired by the Companys joint venture, National Welders) with combined annual sales of approximately $141 million. The largest of these acquisitions included the June 2005 purchase of the Industrial Products Division of LaRoche Industries, Inc. (LaRoche). LaRoche was a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $65 million. The LaRoche operations were incorporated into a new business unit, Airgas Specialty Products, that was added to the All Other Operations business segment. 29 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 20% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 driven primarily by strong same store sales growth of 11% and acquisitions. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. Net Sales (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 2,395,938 $ 2,035,112 $ 360,826 18 % All Other Operations 493,430 385,611 107,819 28 % Intercompany eliminations (59,758 ) (52,941 ) (6,817 ) $ 2,829,610 $ 2,367,782 $ 461,828 20 % Distribution segment sales increased 18% compared to fiscal 2005 driven by same store sales growth of $245 million (11%) and sales contributed by both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 acquisitions of $116 million. Incremental sales from acquisitions were driven by nine fiscal 2006 acquisitions and the impact of a full year of operations of the July 2004 acquisition of the packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. (BOC). Same store sales growth was driven approximately equally by pricing initiatives and higher sales volumes. Price increases were initiated in response to rising product, operating and distribution costs as well as other factors. Higher sales volumes resulted from the continued strength of the industrial economy and the continued success of the Companys growth initiatives. Same store sales growth of hardgoods was 13%, and gas and rent was 10%, with a majority of the Companys business units reporting double digit growth. Sales growth in the Gulf Coast and southwestern portions of the U.S. was particularly strong reflecting post hurricane demand for equipment, safety products and welding machines. Sales growth was also driven by sales of strategic products. Strategic products were identified by the Company as those expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall industrial economy and include safety products, medical, specialty, and bulk gases, as well as carbon dioxide products, such as dry ice. The Distribution segments same store sales growth for gas and rent of 10% was driven by price increases and volume growth. Broad pricing actions were initiated in March 2005 and November 2005 in response to rising product and delivery costs. Sales growth was achieved across nearly all major product lines, including the largest product line, industrial gases (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, argon, acetylene, etc.). Sales of strategic products, particularly related to bulk, medical and specialty gases, also helped drive the growth in gas and rent same store sales. Sales of bulk, medical, and specialty gases generated combined same store sales growth of 12%. Same store sales growth was also helped by a 31% increase in welding equipment rentals. The increase in Distribution same store sales from hardgoods of $131 million (13%) is attributable to strong volume gains in sales of safety and Radnor private label products. Same store sales of safety products grew 17% in fiscal 2006 benefiting from excellent execution in cross selling and in our telesales operation, the strong industrial economy and reconstruction efforts along the Gulf Coast. Radnor products grew 26% reflecting the rollout of new products and expansion of the Companys branch store core stocking program to acquired locations. Same store sales of hardgoods also benefited from pricing actions taken during fiscal 2006 to offset rising product costs. 30 Table of Contents In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the All Other Operations segment consisted of the Companys Gas Operations Division and its National Welders joint venture. The Gas Operations Division produces and distributes certain gas products, principally carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. Beginning in June 2005, the division also began distributing anhydrous ammonia and related supplies, services and equipment. National Welders is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods based in Charlotte, North Carolina. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany eliminations, increased $101 million compared to fiscal 2005. The acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia business from LaRoche and the subsequent formation of Airgas Specialty Products in June 2005 contributed sales of $67 million in fiscal 2006. Same store sales growth was primarily attributable to National Welders and pricing actions taken by Airgas Specialty Products. Sales of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice also increased modestly. Gross Profits Gross profits increased 17% resulting from higher sales volumes, acquisitions and price increases. The gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points to 50.5% in fiscal 2006 compared to 51.4% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the gross profit margin reflects the acquisition and subsequent growth of the lower margin anhydrous ammonia product line and a shift in sales mix. Gross Profit (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 1,172,503 $ 1,004,828 $ 167,675 17 % All Other Operations 255,129 211,172 43,957 21 % $ 1,427,632 $ 1,216,000 $ 211,632 17 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $168 million (17%) compared to fiscal 2005. Distributions gross profit margin of 48.9% decreased 50 basis points from 49.4% in fiscal 2005. The lower gross profit margin reflects a shift in gas sales mix, including the impact of higher sales growth of lower margin bulk gases, as well as higher same store sales growth of lower margin hardgoods. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 51.7% gas and rent compared to 51.9% in fiscal 2005. Pricing actions taken by the Company in fiscal 2006 helped to mitigate the impact of rising product costs. The All Other Operations segments gross profits increased $44 million primarily from strong sales at National Welders and the addition of the anhydrous ammonia business in fiscal 2006. Although the gross profit dollars for the segment increased, the gross profit margin declined by 310 basis points to 51.7% from 54.8% in fiscal 2005. The gross profit margin decline reflects the acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia product line, which carries a lower margin than other products in this segment, and competitive pressures in the market for dry ice. Operating Expenses As a percentage of net sales, SDA expenses decreased 170 basis points to 36.4% compared to 38.1% in fiscal 2005 resulting from improved cost leverage. SDA expenses increased $129 million (14%) primarily from operating costs of acquired businesses and higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes. As compared with fiscal 2005, acquisitions contributed an estimated additional $62 million to SDA expenses. The SDA expenses contributed by fiscal 2006 acquisitions reflect acquisition integration costs that were $1.9 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 SDA expenses reflect a total of $6.4 million of costs associated with integrating the BOC acquisition as well as employee separation costs. The balance of the increase in SDA expenses is primarily attributable to higher labor costs, distribution related expenses, selling expenses and approximately $2.2 million of incremental costs resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in labor costs reflected costs to fill cylinders and operate facilities to meet increased demand for products as well as normal wage inflation. The increase in distribution expenses is attributable to higher fuel costs and vehicle repair and maintenance expenses. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise in diesel fuel prices and the increase in miles driven to support the higher sales volumes. The increase in selling expenses is attributable to higher sales levels. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation expense of $122 million increased $17 million (16%) compared to $105 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 acquisitions contributed depreciation expense of approximately $8 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects fiscal 2006s and fiscal 2005s capital expenditures to support growth, including purchases of cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders. Amortization expense of $5 million in fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005. Operating Income Operating income increased 33% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 driven by higher sales levels. Cost leverage and the improved operations of the BOC business acquired in fiscal 2005 contributed to a 90 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 9.5% compared to 8.6% in fiscal 2005. Operating Income (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 208,466 $ 157,239 $ 51,227 33 % All Other Operations 60,292 45,215 15,077 33 % $ 268,758 $ 202,454 $ 66,304 33 % Operating income in the Distribution segment increased 33% in fiscal 2006. The Distribution segments operating income margin increased 100 basis points to 8.7% compared to 7.7% in fiscal 2005. The increase in the operating income margin reflects the lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, described above. Fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by integration costs and initial lower margins of the business acquired from BOC. Operating income in the All Other Operations segment increased 33% resulting primarily from the strong business momentum of National Welders as well as the acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia business from LaRoche. The segments operating income margin increased 50 basis points to 12.2% in fiscal 2006 compared to 11.7% in fiscal 2005. The higher operating income margin principally relates to lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by the lower operating margin of the anhydrous ammonia business. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $63 million representing an increase of 13% compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in interest expense primarily resulted from higher debt levels associated with acquisitions and higher weighted average interest rates. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with commercial banks to sell qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $244 million and $190 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2006 was 53% fixed to 47% variable. 32 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 37.4% of pre tax earnings compared to 36.8% in fiscal 2005. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2005 resulted from favorable changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the realization of federal and state tax credits. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to $91.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share in fiscal 2005. Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations As a result of the divestiture of Rutland Tool in December 2005, the Company reflected fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 operating results of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. The fiscal 2006 loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. Proceeds from the divestiture were approximately $15 million. In fiscal 2005, income from discontinued operations was $464 thousand. The operating results of Rutland Tool were previously reflected in the Distribution business segment. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle In conjunction with the adoption of FIN 47 on March 31, 2006, the Company recorded an after tax charge of $2.5 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Net Earnings Net earnings were $123.6 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. Pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the preferred stock of National Welders, until June 30, 2009, the preferred stockholders have the option to exchange their 3.2 million shares of National Welders voting redeemable preferred stock either for cash at a price of $17.78 per share or to tender them to the joint venture in exchange for approximately 2.3 million shares of Airgas common stock. If Airgas common stock has a market value of $24.45 per share, the stock and cash redemption options are equivalent. The weighted shares used in the fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share calculation include the assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock. In fiscal 2005, the conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock was anti dilutive. Also see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. 33 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2007 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $318 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $352 million in fiscal 2006. Net earnings adjusted for non cash items provided cash of $384 million versus $304 million in the prior year. Working capital resulted in a use of cash of $86 million versus a use of $8 million in the prior year. The use of cash for working capital in fiscal 2007 principally reflects a higher level of trade receivables associated with sales growth, a higher level of income tax payments, and the timing of payments to vendors. The Company also increased the amount of receivables sold under its trade receivables securitization program providing cash of $20 million in the current year versus $54 million in the prior year. Cash flows of National Welders, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders to the Company, are not available to the Company. Cash provided by operating activities in the current year included $34 million of cash provided by National Welders versus $23 million in the prior year. Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were used to fund investing activities, such as capital expenditures and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 totaled $923 million and primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash of $688 million was paid in the current year for 13 acquisitions, including the acquisition of Lindes bulk gas business, and holdback settlements. Capital expenditures were $244 million in the current period (including $18 million at National Welders). Capital expenditures reflect investments to support the Companys sales growth initiatives. For example, investments in rental welders by the Companys Red D Arc subsidiary supported its fiscal 2007 same store sales growth of 33%. The Company has also continued to invest in its core business through purchasing cylinders and bulk tanks. Other significant investments included a new carbon dioxide plant and fill plant expansions. The Company expects that fiscal 2008 capital expenditures will approximate 7% of net sales. Financing activities provided net cash of $596 million primarily from net borrowings under the Companys Credit Facility. The additional borrowing was principally used to fund acquisitions. Other sources of cash effectively offset the use of cash within financing activities. Dividends During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07, $0.06 and $0.045 per share, respectively. On May 8, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, which is payable on June 29, 2007 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2007. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. Stock Repurchase Plan Due to certain contemplated acquisitions, in July 2006, the Company suspended the three year share repurchase plan that it initiated in November 2005. No shares of Company common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2007. Since inception, 195,400 shares have been repurchased under the plan and $137.2 million of the original $150 million authorization remains available. The Company continues to focus on using its cash flow for investing in growth opportunities, including future acquisitions, paying down debt and growing its dividend. 34 Table of Contents Financial Instruments Debt Refinancing Effective July 25, 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Subject to compliance with certain covenants, the $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility) permits the Company to borrow up to $966 million under a U.S. dollar revolving credit line, up to C$40 million (U.S. $34 million) under a Canadian dollar revolving credit line and up to $600 million under two or more term loans. The Company used borrowings under the term loan provision of the Credit Facility to finance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006. The remaining $500 million term loan was used to finance the previously announced Linde bulk gas acquisition that closed on March 9, 2007. The Credit Facility will mature on July 25, 2011. As of March 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $1,067 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility: $471 million under the U.S. dollar revolver, C$22 million (U.S. $18 million) under the Canadian dollar revolver and a $578 million under the term loan. The term loans are repayable in quarterly installments of $22.5 million between March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2010. The quarterly installments then increase to $71.2 million from September 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011. The Company also had letters of credit of $34 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The U.S. dollar borrowings and the term loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points and the Canadian dollar borrowings bear interest at the Canadian Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 75 basis points. As of March 31, 2007, the effective interest rates on the U.S. dollar borrowings, the term loans and the Canadian dollar borrowings were 6.09%, 6.10%and 5.20%, respectively. The Companys domestic subsidiaries, exclusive of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity (the domestic guarantors), guarantee the U.S. and Canadian borrowings. The Canadian borrowings are also guaranteed by the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees are full and unconditional and are made on a joint and several basis. The Company has pledged 100% of the stock of its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries as surety for its obligations under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for the release of the guarantees and collateral if the Company attains an investment grade credit rating and a similar release on all other debt. Total Borrowing Capacity and Acquisition Financing At March 31, 2007, approximately $461 million remained unused under the U.S. dollar revolving credit line and approximately C$18 million (U.S. $16 million) remained unused under the Canadian dollar revolving credit line. As of March 31, 2007, the financial covenants of the Credit Facility permitted the Company increase its total borrowings under the Credit Facility or through other debt instruments by approximately $538 million. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment and breach of covenants. In the event of default, repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility may be accelerated. The Company continues to look for acquisition candidates. The financial covenant calculations of the Credit Facility include the pro forma results of acquired businesses. Therefore, total borrowing capacity is not reduced dollar for dollar with acquisition financing. The Company intends to finance the pending acquisition (purchase price of $310 million) of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde AG with borrowings under the revolving credit line of the Credit Facility. A portion of the business to be acquired will be sold by the Company to National Welders. National Welders will secure financing necessary to acquire their portion of the business. The Company believes that it could obtain financing on reasonable terms if its requirements exceed amounts available under the Credit Facility. The terms of any future financing arrangements depend on market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time. 35 Table of Contents Money Market Loan The Company has an agreement with a financial institution that provides access to short term advances not to exceed $30 million for a maximum term of three months. The agreement expires on November 30, 2007, but may be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March 31, 2007, the Company had an outstanding advance under the agreement of $30 million for a term of 90 days bearing interest at 5.75%. Senior Subordinated Notes At March 31, 2007, the Company had $150 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2004 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of July 15, 2014. The 2004 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2004 Notes have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2004 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is July 15, 2009 at a price of 103.125% of the principal amount. The 2004 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The 2004 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the Credit Facility. The stock of the Companys domestic subsidiaries is also pledged to the note holders on a subordinated basis. On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes in full at a premium of 104.563% of the principal amount with proceeds from the Companys revolving credit line. In conjunction with the redemption of the Notes, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax) in October 2006. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long term debt also included acquisition and other notes principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2007, acquisition and other notes totaled approximately $17 million with interest rates ranging from 4% to 8.5%. Financial Instruments of the National Welders Joint Venture Pursuant to the requirements of the FASBs Financial Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R), the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2007 and 2006 include the financial obligations of National Welders. National Welders financial obligations are non recourse to the Company, meaning that the creditors of National Welders do not have a claim on the assets of Airgas, Inc. The National Welders Credit Agreement (the NWS Credit Agreement) provides for a revolving credit line of $100 million, a Term Loan A of $26 million, a Term Loan B of $21 million, and a Term Loan C of $9 million. At March 31, 2007, National Welders had borrowings under its revolving credit line of $73 million and under Term Loan A of $12 million. There were no amounts outstanding under Term loans B or C at March 31, 2007. National Welders also had $681 thousand in acquisition notes and other debt obligations. 36 Table of Contents The NWS revolving credit borrowings mature in August 2009. Term Loan A is repayable in monthly amounts of $254 thousand plus accrued interest with a lump sum payment of the outstanding balance at maturity in March 2011. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit line and Term Loan A ranges from LIBOR plus 70 to 145 basis points varying with National Welders leverage ratio. At March 31, 2007, the effective interest rate for the revolving credit line and Term Loan A was 6.02%. The NWS Credit Agreement also contains certain covenants which, among other things, subject National Welders to minimum net worth requirements, limit the ability of National Welders to incur and guarantee new indebtedness, and limit its capital expenditures, ownership changes, merger and acquisition activity, and the payment of dividends. National Welders had additional borrowing capacity under the NWS Credit Agreement of approximately $27 million at March 31, 2007. Term Loans B and C were previously repaid and provide no additional borrowing capacity. As of March 31, 2007, the revolving credit line and Term Loan A are secured by certain current assets, principally trade receivables and inventory, totaling $38 million, non current assets, principally equipment, totaling $119 million, and Airgas common stock with a market value of $39 million classified as treasury stock and carried at cost of $370 thousand. Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. During fiscal 2007, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $2.70 billion of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $2.68 billion in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $264 million at March 31, 2007 and $244 million at March 31, 2006. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. At March 31, 2007, the Company had six fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $150 million. These swaps effectively convert $150 million of variable interest rate debt associated with the Companys Credit Facility to fixed rate debt. At March 31, 2007, two swap agreements with a total notional amount of $50 million required the Company to make fixed interest payments based on a weighted average effective rate of 4.15% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on a weighted average variable rate of 5.32%. The four other swap agreements with a total notional amount of $100 million required the Company to make fixed interest payments based on a weighted average effective rate of 5.39% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on a weighted average variable rate of 5.35%. The remaining terms of each of these swap agreements are between 15 months to 26 months. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties. National Welders was a party to one interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution with a notional principal amount of $27 million. National Welders is required to make fixed interest payments of 5.36% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparty based on one month LIBOR, which was 5.36% at March 31, 2007. The remaining term of the swap agreement is 26 months. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements, the debt of National Welders, and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2007 was 21% fixed to 79% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over LIBOR. Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $3 million. 37 Table of Contents OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets and business insurance reserves. Uncertainties about future events make these estimates susceptible to change. Management evaluates these estimates regularly and believes they are the best estimates, appropriately made, given the known facts and circumstances. For the three years ended March 31, 2007, there were no material changes in the valuation methods or assumptions used by management. However, actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are critical due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for these matters, their susceptibility to change and the potential impact that different assumptions could have on operating performance. Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes sales returns, sales allowances, and bad debts. The allowance adjusts the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on estimates of accounts that will not ultimately be collected. An allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established as trade receivables age beyond their due date. As past due balances age, higher valuation allowances are established lowering the net carrying value of receivables. The amount of valuation allowance established for each past due period reflects the Companys historical collections experience and current economic conditions and trends. The Company also establishes valuation allowances for specific problem accounts and bankruptcies. The amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions, the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions, the financial condition of individual customers, and the terms of reorganization for accounts emerging from bankruptcy. Changes in these conditions impact the Companys collection experience and may result in the recognition of higher or lower valuation allowances. Management evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company has a low concentration of credit risk due to its broad and diversified customer base across multiple industries and geographic locations, and its relatively low average order size. No individual customer accounts for more than 0.5% of the Companys annual sales. Historically, the Companys sales returns, sales allowances, and bad debts have been in the range of 1.4% to 1.7% of sales. Inventories The Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of the products the Company carries in inventory have long shelf lives and are not subject to technological obsolescence. The Company writes its inventory down to its estimated market value when it believes the market value is below cost. The Company estimates its ability to recover the costs of items in inventory by product type based on its age, the rate at which that product line is turning in inventory, its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The ability of the Company to recover its cost for products in inventory can be affected by factors such as future customer demand, general market conditions and the relationship with significant suppliers. Management evaluates the recoverability of its inventory at least quarterly. In aggregate, inventory turns approximately four times per year. 38 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October 31 of each year or whenever indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value. Implied fair value is estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis for each reporting unit. The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. The Companys analysis uses internally generated budgets and long range forecasts, which are the same budgets and forecasts used for managing operations, awarding management bonuses and seeking alternative or additional financing. The Companys discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in these budgets and forecasts about sales trends, inflation, working capital needs, and forecasted capital expenditures along with an estimate of the reporting units terminal value (the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period) to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys assumptions about working capital needs and capital expenditures are based on historical experience. Terminal values reflect an assumed perpetual growth rate consistent with long term expectations for inflation. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows is a risk adjusted rate consistent with the weighted average cost of capital of peer group companies for a term equal to the forecast period. The Company believes the assumptions used in its discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, the Company may not meet its sales growth and profitability targets, working capital needs and capital expenditures may be higher than forecast, changes in credit markets may result in changes to the Companys discount rate and general business conditions may result in changes to the Companys terminal value assumptions for its reporting units. Based on the October 31, 2006 assessment, the Company does not expect that such changes would result in the recognition of goodwill impairment in the Companys reporting units. Business Insurance Reserves The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile, and general liability claims. During fiscal 2007, these programs had self insured retention of $1 million per occurrence. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Companys self insured retention was $500 thousand per occurrence with an additional aggregate retention of $2.2 million in fiscal 2006 and $1.7 million in fiscal 2005, for claims in excess of $500 thousand. For fiscal 2008, the self insured retention will remain $1 million per occurrence with no additional aggregate retention. The Company reserves for its self insured retention based on individual claim evaluations performed by a qualified third party administrator. The third party administrator establishes loss estimates for known claims based on the current facts and circumstances. These known claims are then developed, through actuarial computations, to reflect the expected ultimate loss for the known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Actuarial computations use the Companys specific loss history, payment patterns, insurance coverage, plus industry trends and other factors to estimate the required reserve for all open claims by policy year and loss type. Reserves for the Companys self insurance retention are evaluated monthly. Semi annually, the Company obtains a third party actuarial report to validate that the computations and assumptions used are consistent with actuarial standards. Certain assumptions used in the actuarial computations are susceptible to change. Loss development factors are influenced by items such as medical inflation, changes in workers compensation laws, and changes in the Companys loss payment patterns, all of which can have a significant influence on the estimated ultimate loss related to the Companys self insured retention. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of open claims may be for amounts more or less than the reserve balances. The Companys operations are spread across a significant number of locations, which helps to mitigate the potential impact of any given event that could give rise to an insurance related loss. Over the last three years, business insurance expense has generally been in the range of 0.8% to 0.9% of sales. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table presents the Companys contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Less than 1 More than 5 Contractual and Off Balance Sheet Obligations Total Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years Years Obligations reflected on the March 31, 2007 Balance Sheet: Long term debt (1) $ 1,350,015 $ 40,296 $ 268,753 $ 889,186 $ 151,780 Estimated interest payments on long term debt (2) 313,849 80,624 137,900 85,225 9,675 Estimated payments (receipts) on interest rate swap agreements (3) (1,200 ) (500 ) (700 ) Off balance sheet obligations as of March 31, 2007: Operating leases (4) 212,889 59,757 90,817 49,546 12,769 Trade receivables securitization (5) 264,400 264,400 Estimated discount on securitization (6) 44,814 14,938 29,876 Letters of credit (7) 34,426 34,426 Purchase obligations: Liquid bulk gas supply agreements (8) 808,021 89,015 165,716 158,750 394,540 Liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements (9) 180,072 15,981 23,700 17,851 122,540 Ammonia supply agreements (10) 87,557 18,469 34,544 34,544 Other purchase commitments (11) 43,996 17,121 11,562 7,983 7,330 Construction commitments (12) 64,974 44,810 20,164 Total $ 3,403,813 $ 413,483 $ 1,046,732 $ 1,163,710 $ 698,634 (1) The less than one year relates to obligations due in fiscal 2008.

The more than 5 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and beyond. Aggregate long term debt instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2007. Long term debt includes capital lease obligations, which were not material and, therefore, did not warrant separate disclosure. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding long term debt instruments. (2) The future interest payments on the Companys long term debt obligations were estimated based on the current outstanding principal reduced by scheduled maturities in each period presented and interest rates 40 Table of Contents as of March 31, 2007. The estimated interest payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of long term debt outstanding and actual interest rates in future periods. (3) Payments or receipts under interest rate swap agreements result from changes in market interest rates compared to contractual rates and payments to be exchanged between the parties to the agreements. The estimated receipts in future periods were determined based on interest rates as of March 31, 2007. Actual receipts or payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual interest rates in future periods. (4) The Companys operating leases include approximately $140 million in fleet vehicles under long term operating leases. The Company guarantees a residual value of $18 million related to its leased vehicles. (5) The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. Under the securitization agreement, on a monthly basis, trade receivables are sold to three commercial banks through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Proceeds received from the sale of receivables were used by the Company to reduce its borrowings under its Credit Facility. The securitization agreement is a form of off balance sheet financing. Also see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (6) The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market interest rates. The estimated discount in future periods is based on receivables sold and interest rates as of March 31, 2007. The actual discount recognized in future periods may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of receivables sold and market rates. (7) Letters of credit are guarantees of payment to third parties. The Companys letters of credit principally back obligations associated with the Companys self insured retention on workers compensation, automobile and general liability claims. The letters of credit are supported by the Companys Credit Facility. (8) In addition to the gas volumes supplied by the recently formed Airgas Merchant Gases, the Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases. The Company has a long term take or pay supply agreement, in effect through September 1, 2017, under which Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) will supply at least 35% of the Companys bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon requirements, exclusive of the volumes produced by the Company and those purchased under the Linde supply agreements noted below. Additionally, the Company purchases helium under the terms of the supply agreement. Based on the volume of fiscal 2007 purchases, the Air Products supply agreement represents approximately $50 million annually in liquid bulk gas purchases. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2007 purchases. The Company and Linde AG as successor to BOC entered into a long term take or pay supply agreement to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon. The agreement will expire in July 2019 and represents approximately $3 million in annual bulk gas purchases. In September and October 2006, the Company and Linde AG entered into a long term take or pay supply agreements to purchase helium. The total annual commitment amount under the Linde agreements is approximately $28 million. The Company also participates in a long term agreement with Praxair to swap production of bulk nitrogen, oxygen, and argon through 2014. The Praxair agreement represents approximately $7 million annually. 41 Table of Contents The supply agreements above contain periodic adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analysis. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. (9) The Company is a party to long term take or pay supply agreements for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide. The aggregate obligations under the supply agreements represent approximately 20% of the Companys annual carbon dioxide requirements. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2007 purchases. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the carbon dioxide supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. Certain of the liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements contain market pricing subject to certain economic indices. (10) The Company purchases ammonia from a variety of sources. With one of those sources, the Company has minimum purchase commitments under supply agreements, which is perpetual pending a 180 day written notification of termination from either party. (11) Other purchase commitments primarily include property, plant and equipment expenditures. (12) Construction commitments represent outstanding commitments to customers to build and operate air separation plants in Carrollton, KY and New Carlisle, IN. The projects are expected to begin operating in the spring of 2009. 42 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Companys borrowing agreements. Interest rate swap agreements are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company has not, and will not establish any interest risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources. The Company maintains the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt within parameters established by management under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Including the effect of interest rate swap agreements on the Companys debt and off balance sheet financing agreements, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt was 21% to 79% at March 31, 2007. The ratio includes the effect of the fixed and variable rate debt of National Welders. Counterparties to interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long term credit ratings of A or better. In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non performance by the counterparties. The table below summarizes the Companys market risks associated with long term debt obligations, interest rate swaps and LIBOR based agreements as of March 31, 2007. For long term debt obligations, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate swaps and LIBOR based agreements, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period. 45 Table of Contents Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Fixed Rate Debt Acquisition and other notes $ 6 $ 5 $ 4 $ $ $ 2 $ 17 $ 17 Interest expense $ 0.9 $ 0.6 $ 0.3 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 2.2 Average interest rate 5.59 % 5.65 % 5.32 % 5.32 % 4.99 % 4.99 % Senior subordinated notes due 2014 $ $ $ $ $ $ 150 $ 150 $ 146 Interest expense $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 19 $ 64 Interest rate 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % National Welders: Acquisition and other notes $ 0.7 $ $ $ $ $ $ 0.7 $ .07 Interest expense $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Interest rate 7.00 % Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Variable Rate Debt Revolving credit facilities $ $ $ $ $ 489 $ $ 489 $ 489 Interest expense $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 10 $ $ 130 Interest rate (a) 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % Term loan $ $ 90 $ 90 $ 236 $ 162 $ $ 578 $ 578 Interest expense $ 34 $ 28 $ 23 $ 15 $ 2 $ $ 102 Interest rate (a) 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % Money market loans $ 30 $ $ $ $ $ $ 30 $ 30 Interest expense $ 1.2 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1.2 Interest rate (a) 5.75 % National Welders: Revolving credit facility $ $ $ 73 $ $ $ $ 73 $ 73 Interest expense $ 4.4 $ 4.4 $ 1.8 $ $ $ $ 10.6 Interest rate (a) 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % Term loan A $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ $ $ 12 $ 12 Interest expense $ 0.7 $ 0.6 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 $ $ $ 2.0 Interest rate (a) 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % 46 Table of Contents Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Interest Rate Swaps: 6 Swaps (Receive Variable)/Pay Fixed Notional amounts $ $ 100 $ 50 $ $ $ $ 150 $ (.04 ) Swap payments/(receipts) $ (0.5 ) $ (0.6 ) $ (0.1 ) $ $ $ $ (1.2 ) $100 million notional amount Variable Receive rate 5.35% Weighted average pay rate 5.39% $50 million notional amount Variable Receive rate 5.32% Weighted average pay rate 4.15% National Welders: 1 Swap (Receive Variable)/Pay Fixed Notional amounts $ $ $ 27 $ $ $ $ 27 $ Variable Receive rate 5.35% $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Weighted average pay rate 5.36% Other Off Balance Sheet LIBOR based agreements: Trade receivable securitization (b) $ $ $ 264 $ $ $ $ 264 $ 264 Discount on securitization $ 15 $ 15 $ 15 $ $ $ $ 45 (a) The variable rate of U.S. Credit Facility and term loan is based on LIBOR as of March 31, 2007.

(b) The trade receivables securitization agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. Limitations of the tabular presentation As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March 31, 2007, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Companys credit rating. Foreign Currency Rate Risk Canadian subsidiaries of the Company are funded with local currency debt. The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 47 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the results for fiscal 2005 include integration costs related to the acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. and employee separation costs of $6.4 million ($4 million after tax). Fiscal 2005 also reflected a full year of National Welders as a consolidated affiliate. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for the effect of the consolidation of National Welders on the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) The results for fiscal 2004 include a fourth quarter special charge recovery of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax) reflecting lower estimates of the ultimate cost of prior years restructuring activities. Fiscal 2004 results also include the fourth quarter consolidation of the National Welders joint venture in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R). Prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company used the Equity Method of Accounting for its investment in National Welders. Accordingly, the consolidation of National Welders under FIN 46R did not have an impact on the Companys net earnings. (5) The results for fiscal 2003 include special charges of $2.7 million ($2.1 million after tax) consisting of a restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products Chemicals, Inc. (6) During fiscal 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07, $0.06, $0.045 and $0.04 per share, respectively. In addition, on May 8, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share payable June 29, 2007 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2007. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. (7) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications reflect the presentation of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. 20 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Item 7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 OVERVIEW Airgas, Inc. (the Company) had net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (fiscal 2007 or current year) of $3.20 billion compared to $2.83 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006 or prior year). Net sales increased by 13% driven by strong same store sales growth and the impact of acquisitions. Same store sales growth contributed 8% to the increase in total sales. Same store sales growth was driven equally by pricing initiatives and higher sales volumes. Price increases were initiated in response to rising product, operating and distribution costs. Higher sales volumes resulted from the continued strength of the industrial economy, the non residential construction environment, and the continued success of the Companys growth initiatives. Acquisitions continue to be an important component of the Companys growth contributing 5% to the overall increase in net sales. Operating income margin expanded 120 basis points in the current year to 10.7% compared to 9.5% in the prior year reflecting continued operating leverage. Solid sales growth and operating expense discipline resulted in income from continuing operations of $154.4 million or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share in fiscal 2006. Accounting Change Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective method. The new standard requires the Company to estimate the value of stock options issued to employees, including options to purchase shares under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and recognize stock based compensation expense over the period in which the options vest. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company used the intrinsic value method outlined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 to account for stock based compensation. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $15.4 million ($10.9 million after tax) or $0.13 per diluted share. Since the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, no stock based compensation expense was reflected in earnings prior to April 1, 2006. Financing Effective July 25, 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Subject to compliance with certain covenants, the $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility) permits the Company to borrow up to $966 million under a U.S. dollar revolving credit line, up to C$40 million (U.S. $34 million) under a Canadian dollar revolving credit line and up to $600 million under two or more term loans. The Company used borrowings under the term loan provision of the Credit Facility to finance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006 and the remaining $500 million for the Linde bulk gas acquisition that closed on March 9, 2007. The Credit Facility matures on July 25, 2011. On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes due October 1, 2011 (the Notes) at a premium of 104.563% of the principal amount with borrowing under the Companys Credit Facility. In conjunction with the redemption of the Notes, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax), or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 21 Table of Contents Acquisitions During fiscal 2007, the Company completed 13 acquisitions with combined annual sales of approximately $336 million. The largest of these acquisitions include the September 2006 purchase of Houston, Texas based Aeriform Corporation, a distributor of industrial gases and related hardgoods. Aeriform, with 29 locations and 240 employees in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas, generated annual revenue of $65 million. In November 2006, the Company purchased the Union Industrial Gas Group, a distributor of industrial gases and related hardgoods. The Union Industrial Gas Group, with 14 locations and 100 employees in New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana, had annual revenue of $38 million. In January 2007, the Company purchased CFC Refimax, a leading full service refrigerant supplier and reclamation company. CFC Refimax, based in Atlanta, Georgia with 50 employees, generated annual revenue of $19 million. In March 2007, the Company acquired Lindes divested U.S. bulk gas assets. The Linde bulk gas business, consisting of eight air separation units (ASUs) and 300 employees, produced annual revenue of $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. With the acquisition of the Linde bulk gas business, the Company formed a new business unit, Airgas Merchant Gases, to manage production, distribution and administrative functions for seven of the air separation plants. One air separation plant and its aligned sales was transferred to the Companys National Welders joint venture. In connection with the transaction, most of the acquired bulk gas customers and related service equipment was transfered to existing Distribution business units. Airgas Merchant Gases principally operates as an internal supplier of bulk oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the business units in the Distribution business segment. Pending Acquisition On March 29, 2007, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire, for $310 million in cash, a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde AG. The operations to be acquired include branches, warehouses, packaged gas fill plants, and other operations involved in distributing packaged industrial and specialty gases and related hardgoods. The business includes 130 locations in 18 states, with more than 1,400 employees, which generated $346 million in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately 50 percent of the revenue was from gas sales and cylinder rent, with the remainder from sales of welding equipment and supplies. The acquisition will be financed under the Companys Credit Facility. Looking Forward The Company anticipates that fiscal 2008 will be another productive year. The Company expects further expansion of the industrial economy during fiscal 2008 and estimates fiscal 2008 net earnings to be between $2.33 to $2.41 per diluted share. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company estimates that it will earn between $0.52 to $0.54 per diluted share. The estimate of fiscal 2008 net earnings anticipates a supportive sales environment and continued success of pricing actions designed to offset rising costs. The annual earnings guidance does not reflect anticipated earnings from the pending acquisition of Lindes U.S. packaged gas business. In accordance with the Companys standard practice, the earnings guidance, noted above, does not reflect any impact from acquisitions that have not closed at the time the guidance is issued. However, the acquired Linde business, net of integration costs, is expected to be slightly accretive in the first twelve months of operation. 22 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 13% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 driven by strong same store sales growth of 8% and acquisition growth of 5%. Same store sales growth reflected pricing initiatives, volume growth, and strategic product sales gains, driven by the continued strength of the industrial production, energy and non residential construction markets served by the Company. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. Net Sales (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 2,691,814 $ 2,395,938 $ 295,876 12 % All Other Operations 579,671 493,430 86,241 17 % Intercompany eliminations (66,434 ) (59,758 ) (6,676 ) $ 3,205,051 $ 2,829,610 $ 375,441 13 % The Distribution segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases; cylinder and equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, and maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) supplies. Distribution segment sales increased 12% compared to the prior year driven by same store sales growth of $200 million (8%) and sales contributed by both current and prior year acquisitions of $96 million. The increase in Distribution same store sales resulted from higher hardgoods sales of $82 million (8%) and gas and rent sales growth of $105 million (8%). Broad demand from industrial, energy infrastructure and non residential construction sectors helped the Companys core gas and welding hardgoods business. Several of the Companys business units reported double digit growth. Sales growth was also driven by double digit growth of strategic products sales. Strategic products are identified by the Company as those expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall industrial economy and include safety products, medical, specialty, and bulk gases, as well as carbon dioxide products, such as dry ice. Accordingly, the Company has initiatives focused on promoting these products. Approximately 75% of the Distribution segments $96 million sales growth contributed by acquisitions was the result of current year acquisitions. Current year acquisitions attributable to the Distribution segment historically generated annual revenue of approximately $300 million. The largest of the current year acquisitions closed in the second half of the fiscal year, with the Linde bulk gas acquisition closing in March 2007. Fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to contribute more than $200 million to the Distribution segments sales growth in fiscal 2008. Additionally as noted in the overview section above, the pending acquisition of a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde, with annual revenues of $346 million, approximately $50 million of which will be acquired by the Companys joint venture National Welders (which is accounted for in the All Other Operations segment), should also be a significant contributor to fiscal 2008 sales growth. The Distribution segments gas and rent same store sales of 8% reflects both price increases and volume growth. The impact of price increases reflects pricing actions implemented in June 2006 and November 2005. Sales of industrial gases during the current year remained strong reflecting demand from the Companys core industrial markets. Sales of strategic gas products increased 11% in the current 23 Table of Contents year driven by bulk, medical and specialty gas sales gains. Bulk gas sales volumes were up related to growth in micro bulk and the signing of new bulk customer contracts. Medical gas sales growth was attributable to higher demand from the hospital sector as well as success of the Walk O2 Bout medical cylinder program. Rental revenues benefited from the Companys rental welder business that generated 33% same store sales growth in the current year. The rebuilding effort in the Gulf Coast area, power plant construction projects and the strong non residential construction market contributed to the increase in demand for welding machines, gases and consumables. Hardgoods same store sales growth reflects continued volume and pricing gains. The Companys successful Radnor private label brand of products generated sales growth of 11% in the current year, reaching a total of $128 million. Same store sales of safety products increased 10% reflecting the success of the telemarketing operations (telesales) and effective cross selling of safety products to new and existing customers. The All Other Operations segment consists of the Companys Gas Operations Division, Airgas Merchant Gases and the National Welders joint venture. The Gas Operations Division produces and distributes certain gas products, principally carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, specialty gases, anhydrous ammonia and related supplies, services and equipment. Airgas Merchant Gases was formed with the acquisition of the Linde bulk gas business to manage production, distribution and administrative functions for the acquired air separation plants. National Welders is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods based in Charlotte, North Carolina. All Other Operations sales increased $86 million (17%) compared to the prior year resulting from same store sales growth and acquisitions. Same store sales growth of 8% was driven by continued sales gains of National Welders and growth in carbon dioxide products. Sales of dry ice and liquid carbon dioxide were strong contributors to sales growth in the current year reflecting success in the food processing and industrial carbon dioxide markets and the Companys nationwide network of Penguin dry ice retail locations. Sales growth from acquisitions primarily reflects a prior year acquisition of a packaged gas distributor by National Welders. Current year acquisitions reflected in the All Other Operations business segment include CFC Refimax, and the Linde bulk gas business. Current year acquisitions did not significantly impact the current years sales growth as they closed in the fourth quarter. However, the fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to have a significant impact on the All Other Operations sales growth in fiscal 2008. The most significant contributor to the All Other Operations sales growth will be Airgas Merchant Gases. However, Airgas Merchant Gases will principally be a wholesale supplier to the business units in the Distribution business segment. Therefore, the sales of Airgas Merchant Gases to the Distrubution segment will be eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Third party sales from the fiscal 2007 acquisitions are expected to contribute approximately $55 million to fiscal 2008 sales growth. As noted above, upon closing the pending acquisition of a significant part of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde, operations with approximately $50 million in annual revenue would be acquired by the Companys National Welders joint venture, also contributing to the fiscal 2008 sales growth. Gross Profits Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. As disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company reflects distribution costs as elements of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment on the income statement line item Depreciation. Other companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their Cost of Products Sold, and as such the Companys gross profits discussed below may not be comparable to those of other entities. 24 Table of Contents Gross profits increased 15% principally from sales growth and acquisitions. The gross margin in the current period was 51.1% compared to 50.5% in the prior year period. Gross Profit (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 1,336,447 $ 1,172,503 $ 163,944 14 % All Other Operations 301,514 255,129 46,385 18 % $ 1,637,961 $ 1,427,632 $ 210,329 15 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $164 million (14%) compared to the prior year. The Distribution segments gross margin was 49.6% versus 48.9% in the prior year. The increase in the gross margin of 70 basis points reflected the impact of price increases as well as a favorable shift in product mix toward and within gas and rent. Gas and rent as a percentage of the Distribution segments sales was 52.0% in the current year as compared to 51.7% in the prior year. The All Other Operations segments gross profits increased $46 million (18%) primarily from strong sales growth at National Welders and sales volume growth of carbon dioxide products. The segments gross margin increased 30 basis points to 52.0% versus 51.7% in the prior year period driven by improvement in pricing and margin expansion particularly with respect to the anhydrous ammonia product line acquired in June 2005. Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SDA) consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SDA expense decreased 50 basis points to 35.9% compared to 36.4% in the prior year reflecting improved cost leverage and effective cost management. The decrease in SDA expense as a percentage of sales occurred despite $15.4 million or approximately 50 basis points of stock based compensation expense in the current year (as described in the Overview section above). There was no stock based compensation expense in the prior year. SDA expenses increased $118 million (11%) primarily from higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes and the operating costs of acquired businesses. Acquisitions contributed estimated incremental SDA expenses of approximately $30 million in the current year. The increase in SDA expense attributable to factors other than stock based compensation and acquisitions was approximately $72 million or an increase of 7% primarily attributable to salaries and wages and distribution related expenses The increase in salaries and wages reflected increased operational headcounts and overtime to fill cylinders, deliver products and operate facilities to meet increased customer demand. The increase in distribution expenses was attributable to higher fuel and vehicle repair and maintenance costs, which were up approximately $12 million versus the prior year. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise in diesel fuel prices over the past year and the increase in miles driven to support related sales growth . Operating expenses in the prior year include $2.2 million associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Depreciation expense of $139 million increased $16 million (13%) compared to the prior year. Acquired businesses contributed depreciation expense of approximately $3.3 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the current and prior years capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand, primarily cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders, as well as the addition of new fill plants and branch stores. Amortization expense of $8.5 million was $3.4 million higher than the prior year period driven by the amortization of customer lists and non compete agreements associated with acquisitions. 25 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income increased 27% in the current year driven by higher sales levels and margin improvement. Improved cost leverage on sales growth was the primary contributor to a 120 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 10.7% compared to 9.5% in the prior year. Operating Income (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 266,708 $ 208,466 $ 58,242 28 % All Other Operations 74,744 60,292 14,452 24 % $ 341,452 $ 268,758 $ 72,694 27 % Operating income in the Distribution segment increased 28% in the current year. The Distribution segments operating margin increased 120 basis points to 9.9% compared to 8.7% in the prior year. The significant margin improvement was driven by continued operating profit leverage on sales growth and effective management of costs and pricing. Operating income in the All Other Operations segment increased 24% compared to the prior year. The segments operating income margin of 12.9% was 70 basis points higher than 12.2% in the prior year. The increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the strong business momentum of National Welders and the improved anhydrous ammonia business. The acquired Linde bulk gas business is expected to improve the Companys consolidated fiscal 2008 operating income and operating margin. The newly formed Airgas Merchant Gases, accounted for in the All Other Operations segment, will principally act as an internal wholesale supplier to the Distribution segment business units. The business units in the Distribution segment will manage the customer relationships and bill the new bulk gas customers. Since the end customer is served by the Distribution segment companies, the improved operating margin will principally be reflected in the Distribution business segment. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $74 million representing an increase of 17% compared to the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from higher average debt levels associated with acquisitions, a larger securitization program and higher weighted average interest rates related to the Companys variable rate debt instruments, partially offset by the current year refinancing of higher fixed rate debt. In July 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Facility expanded the Companys borrowing capacity, subject to compliance with certain covenants, to $1.6 billion principally at an effective interest rate of LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The Company used the Credit Facility to refinance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006. Additionally, on October 27, 2006, the Company used the Credit Facility to redeem its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes. Based on current interest rates under the revolving credit facility, interest savings from these refinancings are estimated to be $700 thousand per month. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $264 million at March 31, 2007 versus $244 million at March 31, 2006. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. 26 Table of Contents As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2007 was 21% fixed to 79% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $3 million. Loss on Debt Extinguishment On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes at a premium of 104.563% with borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company recognized a third quarter charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax) or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.8% of pre tax earnings in the current year compared to 37.4% in the prior year. The effective income tax rate in the current year reflects a one time tax benefit associated with changes in state income tax law in Texas. Additionally, the current years tax rate reflects the limited deductibility of stock based compensation associated with the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the absence of state tax benefits associated with the loss on the extinguishment of debt. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2006 reflected favorable changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and a favorable adjustment to previously recorded tax liabilities. The Company expects the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 to range from 39% to 39.5% of pre tax earnings. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations in the current year was $154 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, which reflects an after tax loss of $7.9 million from the early extinguishment of debt, or $0.10 per diluted share, stock based compensation expense of $10.9 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share, and $1.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, one time tax benefit associated with changes in state income tax law. Income from continuing operations in the prior period was $128 million, or $1.62 per diluted share. Stock based compensation expense was not recognized in the prior year. Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations In December 2005, the Company divested its business unit Rutland Tool Supply Co., Inc. (Rutland Tool). Consequently, the operating results of Rutland Tool for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are reflected as discontinued operations. For fiscal 2006, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. 27 Table of Contents Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Effective March 31, 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, (FIN 47), and recorded a $2.5 million after tax charge ($0.03 per diluted share) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Net Earnings Net earnings were $154.4 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $123.6 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in the prior year. Pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the preferred stock of National Welders, until June 30, 2009, the preferred stockholders have the option to exchange their 3.2 million shares of National Welders voting redeemable preferred stock either for cash at a price of $17.78 per share or to tender them to the joint venture in exchange for approximately 2.3 million shares of Airgas common stock. If Airgas common stock has a market value of $24.45 per share, the stock and cash redemption options are equivalent. The weighted shares used in the fiscal 2007 and 2006 diluted earnings per share calculations include the assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock. Also see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. 28 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 OVERVIEW The Company had net sales for fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006) of $2.83 billion compared to $2.37 billion for fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005). Net sales increased by 20% driven by strong same store sales growth and the impact of acquisitions. Same store sales growth contributed 11% to the increase in total sales. Acquisitions contributed 9% to the overall increase in net sales. The operating income margin expanded 90 basis points in fiscal 2006 to 9.5% compared to 8.6% in fiscal 2005 reflecting improving cost leverage. Solid sales growth and operating expense discipline resulted in income from continuing operations of $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to $91.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005, a 36% increase. Accounting Change Effective March 31, 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, (FIN 47), and recorded a $2.5 million after tax charge ($0.03 per diluted share) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Discontinued Operations On December 1, 2005, the Company divested its subsidiary, Rutland Tool. Rutland Tool distributed metalworking tools, machine tools and MRO supplies from seven locations and had approximately 180 employees. Rutland Tool generated annual sales of approximately $50 million and an insignificant amount of operating income. As a result of the divestiture, the Company reflected fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 operating results of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. The fiscal 2006 loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. Proceeds from the divestiture were approximately $15 million. The operating results of Rutland Tool were previously reflected in the Distribution business segment. Acquisitions During fiscal 2006, the Company completed 13 acquisitions (including three businesses acquired by the Companys joint venture, National Welders) with combined annual sales of approximately $141 million. The largest of these acquisitions included the June 2005 purchase of the Industrial Products Division of LaRoche Industries, Inc. (LaRoche). LaRoche was a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $65 million. The LaRoche operations were incorporated into a new business unit, Airgas Specialty Products, that was added to the All Other Operations business segment. 29 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 20% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 driven primarily by strong same store sales growth of 11% and acquisitions. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution segment. Net Sales (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 2,395,938 $ 2,035,112 $ 360,826 18 % All Other Operations 493,430 385,611 107,819 28 % Intercompany eliminations (59,758 ) (52,941 ) (6,817 ) $ 2,829,610 $ 2,367,782 $ 461,828 20 % Distribution segment sales increased 18% compared to fiscal 2005 driven by same store sales growth of $245 million (11%) and sales contributed by both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 acquisitions of $116 million. Incremental sales from acquisitions were driven by nine fiscal 2006 acquisitions and the impact of a full year of operations of the July 2004 acquisition of the packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. (BOC). Same store sales growth was driven approximately equally by pricing initiatives and higher sales volumes. Price increases were initiated in response to rising product, operating and distribution costs as well as other factors. Higher sales volumes resulted from the continued strength of the industrial economy and the continued success of the Companys growth initiatives. Same store sales growth of hardgoods was 13%, and gas and rent was 10%, with a majority of the Companys business units reporting double digit growth. Sales growth in the Gulf Coast and southwestern portions of the U.S. was particularly strong reflecting post hurricane demand for equipment, safety products and welding machines. Sales growth was also driven by sales of strategic products. Strategic products were identified by the Company as those expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall industrial economy and include safety products, medical, specialty, and bulk gases, as well as carbon dioxide products, such as dry ice. The Distribution segments same store sales growth for gas and rent of 10% was driven by price increases and volume growth. Broad pricing actions were initiated in March 2005 and November 2005 in response to rising product and delivery costs. Sales growth was achieved across nearly all major product lines, including the largest product line, industrial gases (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, argon, acetylene, etc.). Sales of strategic products, particularly related to bulk, medical and specialty gases, also helped drive the growth in gas and rent same store sales. Sales of bulk, medical, and specialty gases generated combined same store sales growth of 12%. Same store sales growth was also helped by a 31% increase in welding equipment rentals. The increase in Distribution same store sales from hardgoods of $131 million (13%) is attributable to strong volume gains in sales of safety and Radnor private label products. Same store sales of safety products grew 17% in fiscal 2006 benefiting from excellent execution in cross selling and in our telesales operation, the strong industrial economy and reconstruction efforts along the Gulf Coast. Radnor products grew 26% reflecting the rollout of new products and expansion of the Companys branch store core stocking program to acquired locations. Same store sales of hardgoods also benefited from pricing actions taken during fiscal 2006 to offset rising product costs. 30 Table of Contents In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the All Other Operations segment consisted of the Companys Gas Operations Division and its National Welders joint venture. The Gas Operations Division produces and distributes certain gas products, principally carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. Beginning in June 2005, the division also began distributing anhydrous ammonia and related supplies, services and equipment. National Welders is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods based in Charlotte, North Carolina. All Other Operations sales, net of intercompany eliminations, increased $101 million compared to fiscal 2005. The acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia business from LaRoche and the subsequent formation of Airgas Specialty Products in June 2005 contributed sales of $67 million in fiscal 2006. Same store sales growth was primarily attributable to National Welders and pricing actions taken by Airgas Specialty Products. Sales of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice also increased modestly. Gross Profits Gross profits increased 17% resulting from higher sales volumes, acquisitions and price increases. The gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points to 50.5% in fiscal 2006 compared to 51.4% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the gross profit margin reflects the acquisition and subsequent growth of the lower margin anhydrous ammonia product line and a shift in sales mix. Gross Profit (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 1,172,503 $ 1,004,828 $ 167,675 17 % All Other Operations 255,129 211,172 43,957 21 % $ 1,427,632 $ 1,216,000 $ 211,632 17 % The Distribution segments gross profits increased $168 million (17%) compared to fiscal 2005. Distributions gross profit margin of 48.9% decreased 50 basis points from 49.4% in fiscal 2005. The lower gross profit margin reflects a shift in gas sales mix, including the impact of higher sales growth of lower margin bulk gases, as well as higher same store sales growth of lower margin hardgoods. The Distribution segments sales consisted of 51.7% gas and rent compared to 51.9% in fiscal 2005. Pricing actions taken by the Company in fiscal 2006 helped to mitigate the impact of rising product costs. The All Other Operations segments gross profits increased $44 million primarily from strong sales at National Welders and the addition of the anhydrous ammonia business in fiscal 2006. Although the gross profit dollars for the segment increased, the gross profit margin declined by 310 basis points to 51.7% from 54.8% in fiscal 2005. The gross profit margin decline reflects the acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia product line, which carries a lower margin than other products in this segment, and competitive pressures in the market for dry ice. Operating Expenses As a percentage of net sales, SDA expenses decreased 170 basis points to 36.4% compared to 38.1% in fiscal 2005 resulting from improved cost leverage. SDA expenses increased $129 million (14%) primarily from operating costs of acquired businesses and higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes. As compared with fiscal 2005, acquisitions contributed an estimated additional $62 million to SDA expenses. The SDA expenses contributed by fiscal 2006 acquisitions reflect acquisition integration costs that were $1.9 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 SDA expenses reflect a total of $6.4 million of costs associated with integrating the BOC acquisition as well as employee separation costs. The balance of the increase in SDA expenses is primarily attributable to higher labor costs, distribution related expenses, selling expenses and approximately $2.2 million of incremental costs resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in labor costs reflected costs to fill cylinders and operate facilities to meet increased demand for products as well as normal wage inflation. The increase in distribution expenses is attributable to higher fuel costs and vehicle repair and maintenance expenses. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise in diesel fuel prices and the increase in miles driven to support the higher sales volumes. The increase in selling expenses is attributable to higher sales levels. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation expense of $122 million increased $17 million (16%) compared to $105 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 acquisitions contributed depreciation expense of approximately $8 million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects fiscal 2006s and fiscal 2005s capital expenditures to support growth, including purchases of cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders. Amortization expense of $5 million in fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005. Operating Income Operating income increased 33% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 driven by higher sales levels. Cost leverage and the improved operations of the BOC business acquired in fiscal 2005 contributed to a 90 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 9.5% compared to 8.6% in fiscal 2005. Operating Income (In thousands) 2006 2005 Increase Distribution $ 208,466 $ 157,239 $ 51,227 33 % All Other Operations 60,292 45,215 15,077 33 % $ 268,758 $ 202,454 $ 66,304 33 % Operating income in the Distribution segment increased 33% in fiscal 2006. The Distribution segments operating income margin increased 100 basis points to 8.7% compared to 7.7% in fiscal 2005. The increase in the operating income margin reflects the lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, described above. Fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by integration costs and initial lower margins of the business acquired from BOC. Operating income in the All Other Operations segment increased 33% resulting primarily from the strong business momentum of National Welders as well as the acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia business from LaRoche. The segments operating income margin increased 50 basis points to 12.2% in fiscal 2006 compared to 11.7% in fiscal 2005. The higher operating income margin principally relates to lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by the lower operating margin of the anhydrous ammonia business. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $63 million representing an increase of 13% compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in interest expense primarily resulted from higher debt levels associated with acquisitions and higher weighted average interest rates. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with commercial banks to sell qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $244 million and $190 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2006 was 53% fixed to 47% variable. 32 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 37.4% of pre tax earnings compared to 36.8% in fiscal 2005. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2005 resulted from favorable changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the realization of federal and state tax credits. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $127.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to $91.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share in fiscal 2005. Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations As a result of the divestiture of Rutland Tool in December 2005, the Company reflected fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 operating results of Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. The fiscal 2006 loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. Proceeds from the divestiture were approximately $15 million. In fiscal 2005, income from discontinued operations was $464 thousand. The operating results of Rutland Tool were previously reflected in the Distribution business segment. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle In conjunction with the adoption of FIN 47 on March 31, 2006, the Company recorded an after tax charge of $2.5 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The ongoing annual expense resulting from the adoption of FIN 47 is not material. Net Earnings Net earnings were $123.6 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to $92 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. Pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the preferred stock of National Welders, until June 30, 2009, the preferred stockholders have the option to exchange their 3.2 million shares of National Welders voting redeemable preferred stock either for cash at a price of $17.78 per share or to tender them to the joint venture in exchange for approximately 2.3 million shares of Airgas common stock. If Airgas common stock has a market value of $24.45 per share, the stock and cash redemption options are equivalent. The weighted shares used in the fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share calculation include the assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock. In fiscal 2005, the conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock was anti dilutive. Also see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. 33 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2007 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $318 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $352 million in fiscal 2006. Net earnings adjusted for non cash items provided cash of $384 million versus $304 million in the prior year. Working capital resulted in a use of cash of $86 million versus a use of $8 million in the prior year. The use of cash for working capital in fiscal 2007 principally reflects a higher level of trade receivables associated with sales growth, a higher level of income tax payments, and the timing of payments to vendors. The Company also increased the amount of receivables sold under its trade receivables securitization program providing cash of $20 million in the current year versus $54 million in the prior year. Cash flows of National Welders, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders to the Company, are not available to the Company. Cash provided by operating activities in the current year included $34 million of cash provided by National Welders versus $23 million in the prior year. Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were used to fund investing activities, such as capital expenditures and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 totaled $923 million and primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash of $688 million was paid in the current year for 13 acquisitions, including the acquisition of Lindes bulk gas business, and holdback settlements. Capital expenditures were $244 million in the current period (including $18 million at National Welders). Capital expenditures reflect investments to support the Companys sales growth initiatives. For example, investments in rental welders by the Companys Red D Arc subsidiary supported its fiscal 2007 same store sales growth of 33%. The Company has also continued to invest in its core business through purchasing cylinders and bulk tanks. Other significant investments included a new carbon dioxide plant and fill plant expansions. The Company expects that fiscal 2008 capital expenditures will approximate 7% of net sales. Financing activities provided net cash of $596 million primarily from net borrowings under the Companys Credit Facility. The additional borrowing was principally used to fund acquisitions. Other sources of cash effectively offset the use of cash within financing activities. Dividends During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07, $0.06 and $0.045 per share, respectively. On May 8, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, which is payable on June 29, 2007 to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2007. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. Stock Repurchase Plan Due to certain contemplated acquisitions, in July 2006, the Company suspended the three year share repurchase plan that it initiated in November 2005. No shares of Company common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2007. Since inception, 195,400 shares have been repurchased under the plan and $137.2 million of the original $150 million authorization remains available. The Company continues to focus on using its cash flow for investing in growth opportunities, including future acquisitions, paying down debt and growing its dividend. 34 Table of Contents Financial Instruments Debt Refinancing Effective July 25, 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Subject to compliance with certain covenants, the $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility) permits the Company to borrow up to $966 million under a U.S. dollar revolving credit line, up to C$40 million (U.S. $34 million) under a Canadian dollar revolving credit line and up to $600 million under two or more term loans. The Company used borrowings under the term loan provision of the Credit Facility to finance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006. The remaining $500 million term loan was used to finance the previously announced Linde bulk gas acquisition that closed on March 9, 2007. The Credit Facility will mature on July 25, 2011. As of March 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $1,067 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility: $471 million under the U.S. dollar revolver, C$22 million (U.S. $18 million) under the Canadian dollar revolver and a $578 million under the term loan. The term loans are repayable in quarterly installments of $22.5 million between March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2010. The quarterly installments then increase to $71.2 million from September 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011. The Company also had letters of credit of $34 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The U.S. dollar borrowings and the term loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points and the Canadian dollar borrowings bear interest at the Canadian Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 75 basis points. As of March 31, 2007, the effective interest rates on the U.S. dollar borrowings, the term loans and the Canadian dollar borrowings were 6.09%, 6.10%and 5.20%, respectively. The Companys domestic subsidiaries, exclusive of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity (the domestic guarantors), guarantee the U.S. and Canadian borrowings. The Canadian borrowings are also guaranteed by the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees are full and unconditional and are made on a joint and several basis. The Company has pledged 100% of the stock of its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries as surety for its obligations under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for the release of the guarantees and collateral if the Company attains an investment grade credit rating and a similar release on all other debt. Total Borrowing Capacity and Acquisition Financing At March 31, 2007, approximately $461 million remained unused under the U.S. dollar revolving credit line and approximately C$18 million (U.S. $16 million) remained unused under the Canadian dollar revolving credit line. As of March 31, 2007, the financial covenants of the Credit Facility permitted the Company increase its total borrowings under the Credit Facility or through other debt instruments by approximately $538 million. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment and breach of covenants. In the event of default, repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility may be accelerated. The Company continues to look for acquisition candidates. The financial covenant calculations of the Credit Facility include the pro forma results of acquired businesses. Therefore, total borrowing capacity is not reduced dollar for dollar with acquisition financing. The Company intends to finance the pending acquisition (purchase price of $310 million) of the U.S. packaged gas business of Linde AG with borrowings under the revolving credit line of the Credit Facility. A portion of the business to be acquired will be sold by the Company to National Welders. National Welders will secure financing necessary to acquire their portion of the business. The Company believes that it could obtain financing on reasonable terms if its requirements exceed amounts available under the Credit Facility. The terms of any future financing arrangements depend on market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time. 35 Table of Contents Money Market Loan The Company has an agreement with a financial institution that provides access to short term advances not to exceed $30 million for a maximum term of three months. The agreement expires on November 30, 2007, but may be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March 31, 2007, the Company had an outstanding advance under the agreement of $30 million for a term of 90 days bearing interest at 5.75%. Senior Subordinated Notes At March 31, 2007, the Company had $150 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2004 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of July 15, 2014. The 2004 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2004 Notes have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2004 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is July 15, 2009 at a price of 103.125% of the principal amount. The 2004 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The 2004 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the Credit Facility. The stock of the Companys domestic subsidiaries is also pledged to the note holders on a subordinated basis. On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes in full at a premium of 104.563% of the principal amount with proceeds from the Companys revolving credit line. In conjunction with the redemption of the Notes, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax) in October 2006. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long term debt also included acquisition and other notes principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2007, acquisition and other notes totaled approximately $17 million with interest rates ranging from 4% to 8.5%. Financial Instruments of the National Welders Joint Venture Pursuant to the requirements of the FASBs Financial Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R), the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2007 and 2006 include the financial obligations of National Welders. National Welders financial obligations are non recourse to the Company, meaning that the creditors of National Welders do not have a claim on the assets of Airgas, Inc. The National Welders Credit Agreement (the NWS Credit Agreement) provides for a revolving credit line of $100 million, a Term Loan A of $26 million, a Term Loan B of $21 million, and a Term Loan C of $9 million. At March 31, 2007, National Welders had borrowings under its revolving credit line of $73 million and under Term Loan A of $12 million. There were no amounts outstanding under Term loans B or C at March 31, 2007. National Welders also had $681 thousand in acquisition notes and other debt obligations. 36 Table of Contents The NWS revolving credit borrowings mature in August 2009. Term Loan A is repayable in monthly amounts of $254 thousand plus accrued interest with a lump sum payment of the outstanding balance at maturity in March 2011. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit line and Term Loan A ranges from LIBOR plus 70 to 145 basis points varying with National Welders leverage ratio. At March 31, 2007, the effective interest rate for the revolving credit line and Term Loan A was 6.02%. The NWS Credit Agreement also contains certain covenants which, among other things, subject National Welders to minimum net worth requirements, limit the ability of National Welders to incur and guarantee new indebtedness, and limit its capital expenditures, ownership changes, merger and acquisition activity, and the payment of dividends. National Welders had additional borrowing capacity under the NWS Credit Agreement of approximately $27 million at March 31, 2007. Term Loans B and C were previously repaid and provide no additional borrowing capacity. As of March 31, 2007, the revolving credit line and Term Loan A are secured by certain current assets, principally trade receivables and inventory, totaling $38 million, non current assets, principally equipment, totaling $119 million, and Airgas common stock with a market value of $39 million classified as treasury stock and carried at cost of $370 thousand. Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. During fiscal 2007, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $2.70 billion of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $2.68 billion in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $264 million at March 31, 2007 and $244 million at March 31, 2006. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. At March 31, 2007, the Company had six fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $150 million. These swaps effectively convert $150 million of variable interest rate debt associated with the Companys Credit Facility to fixed rate debt. At March 31, 2007, two swap agreements with a total notional amount of $50 million required the Company to make fixed interest payments based on a weighted average effective rate of 4.15% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on a weighted average variable rate of 5.32%. The four other swap agreements with a total notional amount of $100 million required the Company to make fixed interest payments based on a weighted average effective rate of 5.39% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on a weighted average variable rate of 5.35%. The remaining terms of each of these swap agreements are between 15 months to 26 months. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties. National Welders was a party to one interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution with a notional principal amount of $27 million. National Welders is required to make fixed interest payments of 5.36% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparty based on one month LIBOR, which was 5.36% at March 31, 2007. The remaining term of the swap agreement is 26 months. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements, the debt of National Welders, and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2007 was 21% fixed to 79% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over LIBOR. Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $3 million. 37 Table of Contents OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets and business insurance reserves. Uncertainties about future events make these estimates susceptible to change. Management evaluates these estimates regularly and believes they are the best estimates, appropriately made, given the known facts and circumstances. For the three years ended March 31, 2007, there were no material changes in the valuation methods or assumptions used by management. However, actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are critical due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for these matters, their susceptibility to change and the potential impact that different assumptions could have on operating performance. Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes sales returns, sales allowances, and bad debts. The allowance adjusts the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on estimates of accounts that will not ultimately be collected. An allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established as trade receivables age beyond their due date. As past due balances age, higher valuation allowances are established lowering the net carrying value of receivables. The amount of valuation allowance established for each past due period reflects the Companys historical collections experience and current economic conditions and trends. The Company also establishes valuation allowances for specific problem accounts and bankruptcies. The amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions, the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions, the financial condition of individual customers, and the terms of reorganization for accounts emerging from bankruptcy. Changes in these conditions impact the Companys collection experience and may result in the recognition of higher or lower valuation allowances. Management evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company has a low concentration of credit risk due to its broad and diversified customer base across multiple industries and geographic locations, and its relatively low average order size. No individual customer accounts for more than 0.5% of the Companys annual sales. Historically, the Companys sales returns, sales allowances, and bad debts have been in the range of 1.4% to 1.7% of sales. Inventories The Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of the products the Company carries in inventory have long shelf lives and are not subject to technological obsolescence. The Company writes its inventory down to its estimated market value when it believes the market value is below cost. The Company estimates its ability to recover the costs of items in inventory by product type based on its age, the rate at which that product line is turning in inventory, its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The ability of the Company to recover its cost for products in inventory can be affected by factors such as future customer demand, general market conditions and the relationship with significant suppliers. Management evaluates the recoverability of its inventory at least quarterly. In aggregate, inventory turns approximately four times per year. 38 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October 31 of each year or whenever indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value. Implied fair value is estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis for each reporting unit. The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. The Companys analysis uses internally generated budgets and long range forecasts, which are the same budgets and forecasts used for managing operations, awarding management bonuses and seeking alternative or additional financing. The Companys discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in these budgets and forecasts about sales trends, inflation, working capital needs, and forecasted capital expenditures along with an estimate of the reporting units terminal value (the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period) to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys assumptions about working capital needs and capital expenditures are based on historical experience. Terminal values reflect an assumed perpetual growth rate consistent with long term expectations for inflation. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows is a risk adjusted rate consistent with the weighted average cost of capital of peer group companies for a term equal to the forecast period. The Company believes the assumptions used in its discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, the Company may not meet its sales growth and profitability targets, working capital needs and capital expenditures may be higher than forecast, changes in credit markets may result in changes to the Companys discount rate and general business conditions may result in changes to the Companys terminal value assumptions for its reporting units. Based on the October 31, 2006 assessment, the Company does not expect that such changes would result in the recognition of goodwill impairment in the Companys reporting units. Business Insurance Reserves The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile, and general liability claims. During fiscal 2007, these programs had self insured retention of $1 million per occurrence. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Companys self insured retention was $500 thousand per occurrence with an additional aggregate retention of $2.2 million in fiscal 2006 and $1.7 million in fiscal 2005, for claims in excess of $500 thousand. For fiscal 2008, the self insured retention will remain $1 million per occurrence with no additional aggregate retention. The Company reserves for its self insured retention based on individual claim evaluations performed by a qualified third party administrator. The third party administrator establishes loss estimates for known claims based on the current facts and circumstances. These known claims are then developed, through actuarial computations, to reflect the expected ultimate loss for the known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Actuarial computations use the Companys specific loss history, payment patterns, insurance coverage, plus industry trends and other factors to estimate the required reserve for all open claims by policy year and loss type. Reserves for the Companys self insurance retention are evaluated monthly. Semi annually, the Company obtains a third party actuarial report to validate that the computations and assumptions used are consistent with actuarial standards. Certain assumptions used in the actuarial computations are susceptible to change. Loss development factors are influenced by items such as medical inflation, changes in workers compensation laws, and changes in the Companys loss payment patterns, all of which can have a significant influence on the estimated ultimate loss related to the Companys self insured retention. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of open claims may be for amounts more or less than the reserve balances. The Companys operations are spread across a significant number of locations, which helps to mitigate the potential impact of any given event that could give rise to an insurance related loss. Over the last three years, business insurance expense has generally been in the range of 0.8% to 0.9% of sales. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table presents the Companys contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Less than 1 More than 5 Contractual and Off Balance Sheet Obligations Total Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years Years Obligations reflected on the March 31, 2007 Balance Sheet: Long term debt (1) $ 1,350,015 $ 40,296 $ 268,753 $ 889,186 $ 151,780 Estimated interest payments on long term debt (2) 313,849 80,624 137,900 85,225 9,675 Estimated payments (receipts) on interest rate swap agreements (3) (1,200 ) (500 ) (700 ) Off balance sheet obligations as of March 31, 2007: Operating leases (4) 212,889 59,757 90,817 49,546 12,769 Trade receivables securitization (5) 264,400 264,400 Estimated discount on securitization (6) 44,814 14,938 29,876 Letters of credit (7) 34,426 34,426 Purchase obligations: Liquid bulk gas supply agreements (8) 808,021 89,015 165,716 158,750 394,540 Liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements (9) 180,072 15,981 23,700 17,851 122,540 Ammonia supply agreements (10) 87,557 18,469 34,544 34,544 Other purchase commitments (11) 43,996 17,121 11,562 7,983 7,330 Construction commitments (12) 64,974 44,810 20,164 Total $ 3,403,813 $ 413,483 $ 1,046,732 $ 1,163,710 $ 698,634 (1) The less than one year relates to obligations due in fiscal 2008. The 1 to 3 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010. The 3 to 5 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2012. The more than 5 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and beyond. Aggregate long term debt instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2007. Long term debt includes capital lease obligations, which were not material and, therefore, did not warrant separate disclosure. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding long term debt instruments. (2) The future interest payments on the Companys long term debt obligations were estimated based on the current outstanding principal reduced by scheduled maturities in each period presented and interest rates 40 Table of Contents as of March 31, 2007. The estimated interest payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of long term debt outstanding and actual interest rates in future periods. (3) Payments or receipts under interest rate swap agreements result from changes in market interest rates compared to contractual rates and payments to be exchanged between the parties to the agreements. The estimated receipts in future periods were determined based on interest rates as of March 31, 2007. Actual receipts or payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual interest rates in future periods. (4) The Companys operating leases include approximately $140 million in fleet vehicles under long term operating leases. The Company guarantees a residual value of $18 million related to its leased vehicles. (5) The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $285 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. Under the securitization agreement, on a monthly basis, trade receivables are sold to three commercial banks through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Proceeds received from the sale of receivables were used by the Company to reduce its borrowings under its Credit Facility. The securitization agreement is a form of off balance sheet financing. Also see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (6) The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market interest rates. The estimated discount in future periods is based on receivables sold and interest rates as of March 31, 2007. The actual discount recognized in future periods may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of receivables sold and market rates. (7) Letters of credit are guarantees of payment to third parties. The Companys letters of credit principally back obligations associated with the Companys self insured retention on workers compensation, automobile and general liability claims. The letters of credit are supported by the Companys Credit Facility. (8) In addition to the gas volumes supplied by the recently formed Airgas Merchant Gases, the Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases. The Company has a long term take or pay supply agreement, in effect through September 1, 2017, under which Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) will supply at least 35% of the Companys bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon requirements, exclusive of the volumes produced by the Company and those purchased under the Linde supply agreements noted below. Additionally, the Company purchases helium under the terms of the supply agreement. Based on the volume of fiscal 2007 purchases, the Air Products supply agreement represents approximately $50 million annually in liquid bulk gas purchases. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2007 purchases. The Company and Linde AG as successor to BOC entered into a long term take or pay supply agreement to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon. The agreement will expire in July 2019 and represents approximately $3 million in annual bulk gas purchases. In September and October 2006, the Company and Linde AG entered into a long term take or pay supply agreements to purchase helium. The total annual commitment amount under the Linde agreements is approximately $28 million. The Company also participates in a long term agreement with Praxair to swap production of bulk nitrogen, oxygen, and argon through 2014. The Praxair agreement represents approximately $7 million annually. 41 Table of Contents The supply agreements above contain periodic adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analysis. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. (9) The Company is a party to long term take or pay supply agreements for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide. The aggregate obligations under the supply agreements represent approximately 20% of the Companys annual carbon dioxide requirements. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2007 purchases. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the carbon dioxide supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. Certain of the liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements contain market pricing subject to certain economic indices. (10) The Company purchases ammonia from a variety of sources. With one of those sources, the Company has minimum purchase commitments under supply agreements, which is perpetual pending a 180 day written notification of termination from either party. (11) Other purchase commitments primarily include property, plant and equipment expenditures. (12) Construction commitments represent outstanding commitments to customers to build and operate air separation plants in Carrollton, KY and New Carlisle, IN. The projects are expected to begin operating in the spring of 2009. 42 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. SFAS 155 addresses the application of SFAS 133 to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. SFAS 155 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 155 and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. SFAS 156 requires that an entity recognize a servicing asset or liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a service contract under certain situations. SFAS 156 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 156 and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued EITF No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement. EITF 06 3 requires companies to disclose the presentation of any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer (e.g. sales and use tax) as either gross or net in the accounting principles included in the notes to the financial statements. EITF 06 3 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will disclose its policy when EITF 06 3 is adopted. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions in an enterprises financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date in order to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the provisions of FIN 48 will be applied to all tax positions accounted for under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, upon initial adoption. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company has not completed its final assessment of the impact of FIN 48, but adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies to the fair value requirements as applicable in other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 157 and has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February of 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 159 and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements. 43 Table of Contents Forward looking Statements This report contains statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Companys borrowing agreements. Interest rate swap agreements are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company has not, and will not establish any interest risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources. The Company maintains the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt within parameters established by management under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Including the effect of interest rate swap agreements on the Companys debt and off balance sheet financing agreements, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt was 21% to 79% at March 31, 2007. The ratio includes the effect of the fixed and variable rate debt of National Welders. Counterparties to interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long term credit ratings of A or better. In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non performance by the counterparties. The table below summarizes the Companys market risks associated with long term debt obligations, interest rate swaps and LIBOR based agreements as of March 31, 2007. For long term debt obligations, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate swaps and LIBOR based agreements, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period. 45 Table of Contents Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Fixed Rate Debt Acquisition and other notes $ 6 $ 5 $ 4 $ $ $ 2 $ 17 $ 17 Interest expense $ 0.9 $ 0.6 $ 0.3 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 2.2 Average interest rate 5.59 % 5.65 % 5.32 % 5.32 % 4.99 % 4.99 % Senior subordinated notes due 2014 $ $ $ $ $ $ 150 $ 150 $ 146 Interest expense $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 19 $ 64 Interest rate 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % 6.25 % National Welders: Acquisition and other notes $ 0.7 $ $ $ $ $ $ 0.7 $ .07 Interest expense $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Interest rate 7.00 % Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Variable Rate Debt Revolving credit facilities $ $ $ $ $ 489 $ $ 489 $ 489 Interest expense $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 10 $ $ 130 Interest rate (a) 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % 6.06 % Term loan $ $ 90 $ 90 $ 236 $ 162 $ $ 578 $ 578 Interest expense $ 34 $ 28 $ 23 $ 15 $ 2 $ $ 102 Interest rate (a) 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % 6.10 % Money market loans $ 30 $ $ $ $ $ $ 30 $ 30 Interest expense $ 1.2 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1.2 Interest rate (a) 5.75 % National Welders: Revolving credit facility $ $ $ 73 $ $ $ $ 73 $ 73 Interest expense $ 4.4 $ 4.4 $ 1.8 $ $ $ $ 10.6 Interest rate (a) 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % Term loan A $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ $ $ 12 $ 12 Interest expense $ 0.7 $ 0.6 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 $ $ $ 2.0 Interest rate (a) 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % 6.02 % 46 Table of Contents Fiscal year of Maturity Fair (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Value Interest Rate Swaps: 6 Swaps (Receive Variable)/Pay Fixed Notional amounts $ $ 100 $ 50 $ $ $ $ 150 $ (.04 ) Swap payments/(receipts) $ (0.5 ) $ (0.6 ) $ (0.1 ) $ $ $ $ (1.2 ) $100 million notional amount Variable Receive rate 5.35% Weighted average pay rate 5.39% $50 million notional amount Variable Receive rate 5.32% Weighted average pay rate 4.15% National Welders: 1 Swap (Receive Variable)/Pay Fixed Notional amounts $ $ $ 27 $ $ $ $ 27 $ Variable Receive rate 5.35% $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Weighted average pay rate 5.36% Other Off Balance Sheet LIBOR based agreements: Trade receivable securitization (b) $ $ $ 264 $ $ $ $ 264 $ 264 Discount on securitization $ 15 $ 15 $ 15 $ $ $ $ 45 (a) The variable rate of U.S. Credit Facility and term loan is based on LIBOR as of March 31, 2007. The variable rate of the Canadian dollar portion of the Credit Facility is the rate on Canadian Bankers Acceptances outstanding as of March 31, 2007. (b) The trade receivables securitization agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. Limitations of the tabular presentation As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March 31, 2007, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Companys credit rating. Foreign Currency Rate Risk Canadian subsidiaries of the Company are funded with local currency debt. The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 47 Table of Contents
