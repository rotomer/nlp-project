ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 OVERVIEW Airgas, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Airgas or the Company) had net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 (fiscal 2008 or current year) of $4 billion compared to $3.2 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (fiscal 2007 or prior year). Net sales increased by 25% in fiscal 2008 driven by the impact of current and prior year acquisitions and strong same store sales growth. Acquisitions accounted for 18% of overall sales growth, primarily driven by the two Linde AG acquisitions, described below. Same store sales growth contributed 7% to the increase in total sales, driven equally by pricing and higher sales volumes. Sales growth related to pricing reflected price increases, which were designed to offset rising product, operating and distribution costs. Higher sales volumes resulted from continued strength in the following: energy and infrastructure construction, medical, food products, environmental, analytical and life sciences customer segments, as well as modest growth of other industrial markets served by the Company. The Companys strategic products and related growth initiatives, described below, also contributed significantly to overall sales growth in fiscal 2008. Strong operating leverage on sales growth resulted in a 120 basis point expansion in the operating income margin to 11.9% in fiscal 2008 compared to 10.7% in the prior year. Net earnings per diluted share grew 39% to $2.66 in fiscal 2008 versus $1.92 in the prior year. Fiscal 2008 included a one time, non cash charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to the conversion of National Welders Supply Company, Inc. (National Welders) from a joint venture to a 100% owned subsidiary, and $0.01 per diluted share tax benefit related to a change in state tax law. Fiscal 2007 included a charge of approximately $0.10 per diluted share from the redemption of the Companys 9.125% senior subordinated notes and a $0.02 per diluted share tax benefit from a change in state income tax law. Acquisitions Fiscal 2008 was a landmark acquisition year for the Company with a total of 18 businesses acquired that generate aggregate annual revenues of more than $500 million. The largest of these acquisitions was the June 30, 2007 acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas operations of Linde AG (Linde Packaged Gas) for $310 million in cash. The acquisition of Linde Packaged Gas included 130 locations in 18 states, with more than 1,400 employees. The acquired business is involved in the distribution of packaged gases and related hardgoods. Linde Packaged Gas generated $346 million in annual revenues during calendar year 2006. Of the 130 locations acquired, 113 locations were merged into the operations of seven regional companies in the Distribution business segment while 17 branches were merged into the operations of National Welders, included in the All Other Operations business segment. In addition, during fiscal 2008, the Company acquired 17 other businesses and settled acquisition holdback liabilities for cash consideration of $170 million. These other acquired businesses generated aggregate annual revenues of more than $160 million. Fiscal 2008 financial results also reflect the impact of prior year acquisitions. The most significant of these was the March 9, 2007 acquisition of the divested U.S. bulk gas assets of Linde AG (Linde Bulk Gas) for $495 million in cash. The Linde Bulk Gas acquisition included eight air separation plants and related bulk gas business with about 300 employees. The acquired business produces and distributes oxygen, nitrogen and argon and generated $176 million in annual revenues during calendar year 2006. 22 Table of Contents The acquired business was renamed Airgas Merchant Gases and now manages production, distribution and administrative functions for seven of the air separation plants. One air separation plant and its aligned sales were transferred to National Welders. Airgas Merchant Gases is reflected in the Companys All Other Operations business segment. Most of the acquired Linde Bulk Gas customers and related service equipment were transferred to existing Distribution business units. Airgas Merchant Gases principally operates as an internal supplier of bulk oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the business units in the Distribution business segment. National Welders Exchange Transaction On July 3, 2007, the preferred stockholders of National Welders exchanged their preferred shares of National Welders for 2.47 million shares of Airgas common stock (the National Welders Exchange Transaction). Upon the exchange, National Welders, formerly a consolidated joint venture, became a 100% owned subsidiary of Airgas. As part of the negotiated exchange, in addition to the shares of Airgas common stock the preferred stockholders had the option to acquire, the Company issued an additional 144 thousand Airgas shares (included in the 2.47 million shares) to the preferred stockholders, which resulted in a one time net after tax charge of $2.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. In connection with the National Welders Exchange Transaction, the Company amended its senior credit facility to increase the size of its U.S. dollar revolving credit line by $100 million to refinance National Welders debt assumed in the transaction. See Note 13 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a description of the National Welders Exchange Transaction. Strategic Products Sales of strategic products generated strong growth of 10% in fiscal 2008. Strategic products include safety products, medical, specialty and bulk gases as well as carbon dioxide and dry ice. The Company has focused on these products over the last decade to broaden its product portfolio and diversify against traditional industrial cyclicality. Many of the strategic products are sold to customers in non cyclical sectors of the economy, including medical, life sciences, food processing and environmental markets. In addition, some of these products represent a strong cross selling opportunity within our broad base of existing customers. The Company believes its focus on these strategic products and markets will help to mitigate the impact of a slowing economic environment. Supply Constraints The industrial gas industry is working through supply constraints related to certain gases, such as helium, argon and carbon dioxide. Throughout fiscal 2008, there has been an industry wide helium shortage resulting in a significant increase in helium costs and reduced volumes available for sale. More recently, the Companys helium supply constraints have been mitigated through new supply agreements and relaxed allocations. The Companys position in argon is also constrained, but has improved recently, as new sources have eased some of the supply issues and gas production capacity is at its highest during the winter months due to lower ambient air temperatures. The Company believes that it will continue to be able to keep its customers supplied by constantly evaluating and improving product sourcing strategies. In some areas of the country, carbon dioxide is also under pressure, as old supply sources have been depleted without being replaced. In October 2007, the Company announced an agreement with Shell Oil to build a 450 ton per day plant in Deer Park, Texas, to better serve the Houston and South Texas areas. The Deer Park plant is expected to begin operating by January 2009. The Company also announced a joint marketing alliance with Renew Energy, LLC, Wisconsins newest and largest ethanol plant, which will enable Airgas carbon dioxide subsidiary to market beverage grade liquid carbon dioxide co product from the plant. The Company began distributing carbon dioxide under the marketing alliance in March 2008. The Company will continue to search for new supply sources of carbon dioxide in areas in which supply is limited. 23 Table of Contents Reinstated Stock Repurchase Plan In November 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan (the Repurchase Plan) that provided the Company with the authorization to repurchase up to $150 million of its common stock. The Repurchase Plan was suspended in July 2006 while the Company consummated its acquisitions of Linde AGs U.S. bulk and packaged gas assets. In March 2008, the Company reinstated its Repurchase Plan and repurchased 496 thousand shares for $21.6 million. As of March 31, 2008, the Company has the remaining authorization to spend up to $116 million on future purchases of its common stock under the Repurchase Plan. 24 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 25% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 driven by acquisition growth of 18% and strong same store sales growth of 7%. Pricing and volume sales gains contributed equally to same store sales growth. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from the All Other Operations business segment to the Distribution business segment. Net Sales (In thousands) 2008 2007 Increase Distribution $ 3,344,064 $ 2,691,814 $ 652,250 24 % All Other Operations 839,757 579,671 260,086 45 % Intercompany eliminations (166,797 ) (66,434 ) (100,363 ) $ 4,017,024 $ 3,205,051 $ 811,973 25 % The Distribution business segments principal products include industrial, medical specialty gases, and process chemicals; cylinder and equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, and maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) supplies. Distribution business segment sales increased 24% compared to the prior year driven by sales contributed by both current and prior year acquisitions of $431 million and same store sales growth of $221 million (7%). Sales growth from acquired businesses was principally attributable to the acquisitions of Linde Bulk Gas and Linde Packaged Gas customers that are now served by the Distribution business segment. The increase in Distribution same store sales resulted from gas and rent same store sales growth of $135 million (8%) and higher hardgoods sales of $86 million (6%). Strong same store sales growth in the Companys core gas and welding hardgoods business reflected broad based demand from industrial markets as well as strong demand in the energy and infrastructure construction sectors, which include projects such as power plants, refineries, pipelines, water treatment plants, bridges and airports. The Distribution business segments sales were also driven by strong sales growth of strategic products. Fiscal 2008 acquisitions are expected to contribute more than $180 million to the Distribution business segment sales growth in fiscal 2009. The Distribution segments gas and rent same store sales growth of 8% reflects both price increases and volume growth, which contributed equally to sales growth. Sales of strategic gas products increased 12% driven by bulk, medical and specialty gas sales gains. Bulk gas sales volumes were up 14% reflecting volume growth from enhanced production capabilities and expanded geographic market coverage associated with the Linde Bulk Gas acquisition. The Companys strong position as a bulk gas distributor also helped increase the number of new bulk customer contracts signed during the year. Medical gas sales grew 9% attributable to continued success with the hospital, physician and dental care markets, all of which have strong future growth prospects. The Walk O2 Bout medical cylinder program tailored for the respiratory therapy market also contributed to medical gas sales. Strong specialty gas sales growth of 12% was driven by demand from key customers in bio tech, life sciences, research, and environmental monitoring markets. The Company expects these specialty gas markets to continue to propel 25 Table of Contents specialty gas sales growth in the future. Rental revenues benefited from the Companys rental welder business that generated 24% same store sales growth in the current year. The Companys rental welder business was helped by its sales concentration in energy and infrastructure construction. Hardgoods same store sales growth of 6% reflects both volume and price gains, which contributed about equally to growth. The Companys successful RADNOR private label brand of products generated sales growth of 24% in the current year, reaching a total of $159 million. Sales of Radnor brand products were helped by the stocking of these products in the branch stores obtained from the Linde Packaged Gas acquisition. Same store sales of safety products increased 8% resulting from the success of the telemarketing operations (telesales) and effective cross selling of safety products to new and existing customers. Hardgoods same store sales growth slowed to 4% in the fourth quarter driven by lower volumes reflecting the recent slowness in certain industrial markets. The All Other Operations business segment consists of the Companys Gas Operations Division, Airgas Merchant Gases and National Welders. The Gas Operations Division produces and or distributes certain gas products, principally carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, specialty gases, anhydrous ammonia, refrigerants and related supplies, services and equipment. The Linde Bulk Gas business acquired in March 2007 and renamed Airgas Merchant Gases manages production, distribution and administrative functions for the acquired air separation plants. Airgas Merchant Gases principally acts as an internal wholesale supplier to the Distribution business segment. The business units in the Distribution business segment manage the customer relationships and bill the bulk gas customers. Accordingly, the majority of the operating profits related to bulk gas sales are reported in the Distribution business segment. National Welders is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods principally in North Carolina and South Carolina. Fiscal 2008 sales of the All Other Operations business segment increased $260 million (45%) compared to the prior year resulting from acquisitions and same store sales growth. Acquisitions contributed 36% to the segments sales growth, which was primarily driven by sales of $109 million of acquired sales from Airgas Merchant Gases. Sales of Airgas Merchant Gases to the Distribution business segment also drove much of the increase in intercompany sales, which are eliminated in consolidation. The addition of National Welders portion of the acquired Linde Packaged Gas business contributed $44 million to acquired sales. Other acquisitions in this segment included refrigerant businesses, which contributed $37 million to acquired sales. Same store sales growth of 9% was driven by sales gains of anhydrous ammonia, refrigerant and carbon dioxide products. Sales volume gains of ammonia resulted from strong demand from customers in the chemical production industry. Sales growth of refrigerants was driven by higher volumes, particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as customers sourced product in advance of the warmer summer months. Sales growth of carbon dioxide and dry ice reflected continued success in the food processing, food and beverage service, pharmaceutical and biotech industries. 26 Table of Contents Gross Profits Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. As disclosed in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the Company reflects distribution costs as an element of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings line Depreciation. Other companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their Cost of Products Sold and, as such, the Companys gross profits discussed below may not be comparable to those of other entities. Gross profits increased 28% principally from acquisitions and sales growth. The gross margin in the current year increased 90 basis points to 52.0% compared to 51.1% in the prior year, with the increase driven primarily by a favorable shift in product mix towards higher margin gas as well as the impact of pricing. Gross Profit (In thousands) 2008 2007 Increase Distribution $ 1,671,883 $ 1,336,447 $ 335,436 25 % All Other Operations 418,715 301,514 117,201 39 % $ 2,090,598 $ 1,637,961 $ 452,637 28 % The Distribution business segments gross profits increased 25% compared to the prior year. The Distribution business segments gross margin was 50% versus 49.6% in the prior year. The 40 basis point increase in the gross margin reflected the favorable shift in product mix toward gas and rent as well as the impact of price increases. Gas and rent as a percentage of the Distribution business segments sales was 54.1% in the current year as compared to 52.0% in the prior year. The All Other Operations business segments gross profits increased 39% primarily from acquisitions. Gross profit growth of 30% from acquisitions was principally due to Airgas Merchant Gases, the addition of National Welders portion of the Linde Packaged Gas acquisition and the acquired refrigerant businesses. The remaining gross profit growth of 9% was primarily driven by strong sales growth of anhydrous ammonia, refrigerant and carbon dioxide products. The segments gross margin decreased 210 basis points to 49.9% versus 52.0% in the prior year driven by the addition of Airgas Merchant Gases, which has lower gross margins than the other businesses in the All Other Operations business segment. Airgas Merchant Gases acts as an internal wholesale supplier of bulk gases to business units in the Distribution business segment. Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative (SDA) expenses consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SDA expense decreased 40 basis points to 35.5% compared to 35.9% in the prior year reflecting improved cost leverage and effective cost management. SDA expenses increased $276 million (24%) primarily from operating costs of acquired businesses and higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes. Acquisitions contributed estimated incremental SDA expenses of approximately $186 million in the current year, including integration expenses of $10 million principally related to the Linde Packaged Gas acquisition. The increase in SDA expense attributable to factors other than acquisitions was approximately $90 million, or an increase of 7%, primarily due to salaries and wages and distribution related expenses. 27 Table of Contents The increase in salaries and wages reflected increased operational headcounts, wage inflation, and overtime to fill cylinders, deliver products and operate facilities to meet increased customer demand. The increase in distribution expenses was attributable to higher fuel and vehicle repair and maintenance costs. Higher fuel and vehicle maintenance costs were related to the increase in miles driven to support sales growth. Average diesel fuel prices were also higher versus the prior year. Depreciation expense of $176 million increased $37 million (27%) compared to the prior year. Acquired businesses added approximately $28 million to depreciation expense. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the current and prior years capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand, primarily cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders, as well as the addition of new fill plants and branch stores. Amortization expense of $14 million was $5 million (64%) higher than the prior year driven by the amortization of customer lists and non compete agreements associated with acquisitions. Operating Income Operating income increased 39% in the current year driven by higher sales levels and margin improvement. Improved cost leverage on sales growth was the primary contributor to a 120 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 11.9% compared to 10.7% in the prior year. Acquisition integration costs principally associated with the Linde Packaged Gas acquisition reduced the operating income margin by approximately 25 basis points. Operating Income (In thousands) 2008 2007 Increase Distribution $ 388,100 $ 266,708 $ 121,392 46 % All Other Operations 88,046 74,744 13,302 18 % $ 476,146 $ 341,452 $ 134,694 39 % Operating income in the Distribution business segment increased 46% in the current year. The Distribution business segments operating income margin increased 170 basis points to 11.6% compared to 9.9% in the prior year. The significant margin improvement was driven by continued operating profit leverage on sales growth, effective management of costs and pricing and the addition of the distribution customers from the Linde Bulk Gas business, which contributed approximately 80 basis points of the operating margin increase. Acquisition integration costs primarily related to the Linde Packaged Gas acquisition reduced the Distribution business segments operating income margin by approximately 25 basis points. Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment increased 18% compared to the prior year, principally driven by acquisitions. The segments operating income margin of 10.5% was 240 basis points lower than 12.9% in the prior year. Airgas Merchant Gases internal transfer pricing on sales to the Distribution business segment was responsible for 150 basis points of the operating income margin decline. Another factor contributing to the decline in the operating income margin was the addition of National Welders portion of the Linde Packaged Gas acquisition and its related integration costs. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $107 million representing an increase of 45% compared to the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from higher average debt levels associated with acquisitions and a larger securitization program, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates related to the Companys variable rate debt instruments and the refinancing of the 9.125% senior subordinated notes in the prior year. See the discussion of the refinancing of the senior subordinated notes under the section Loss on Debt Extinguishment, below. 28 Table of Contents The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $360 million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $360 million at March 31, 2008 versus $264 million at March 31, 2007. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at March 31, 2008 was 40% fixed to 60% variable. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $3 million. Loss on Debt Extinguishment On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes at a premium of 104.563% with borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax), or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.9% of pre tax earnings in the current year compared to 38.8% in the prior year. The current and prior year periods include tax benefits associated with a change in the Texas state income tax law, which reduced the effective tax rate by 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively. The prior year tax benefit resulted from the initial change in the law and the current year tax benefit was based on additional guidance issued by the state of Texas. These tax benefits reflect the reduction of deferred tax liabilities previously established for temporary differences under the prior state tax law. The fiscal 2007 tax rate also reflects the absence of state tax benefits associated with the loss on the extinguishment of debt. Net Earnings Net earnings were $223 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, compared to $154 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, in the prior year. The current year included a one time, non cash charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to the conversion of National Welders from a joint venture to a 100% owned subsidiary, and $0.01 per diluted share tax benefit related to a change in Texas state income tax law. The prior year period included a charge of approximately $0.10 per diluted share from the early extinguishment of debt and a $0.02 per diluted share tax benefit from a change in Texas state income tax law. 29 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 OVERVIEW The Company had net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (fiscal 2007) of $3.20 billion compared to $2.83 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006). Net sales increased by 13% driven by strong same store sales growth and the impact of acquisitions. Same store sales growth contributed 8% to the increase in total sales. Same store sales growth was driven equally by pricing initiatives and higher sales volumes. Price increases were initiated in response to rising product, operating and distribution costs. Higher sales volumes resulted from the continued strength of the industrial economy, the non residential construction environment, and the continued success of the Companys growth initiatives. Acquisitions continue to be an important component of the Companys growth contributing 5% to the overall increase in net sales. Operating income margin expanded 120 basis points in fiscal 2007 to 10.7% compared to 9.5% in fiscal 2006 reflecting continued operating leverage. Solid sales growth and operating expense discipline resulted in income from continuing operations of $154 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $128 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. Accounting Change Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R), using the modified prospective method. The standard requires the Company to estimate the value of stock options issued to employees, including options to purchase shares under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and recognize stock based compensation expense over the period in which the options vest. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company used the intrinsic value method outlined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, to account for stock based compensation. In fiscal 2007, the Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $15.4 million ($10.9 million after tax), or $0.13 per diluted share. Since the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, no stock based compensation expense was reflected in earnings prior to April 1, 2006. Acquisitions During fiscal 2007, the Company completed 13 acquisitions with combined annual sales of approximately $336 million. These acquisitions included the September 2006 purchase of Houston, Texas based Aeriform Corporation, a distributor of industrial gases and related hardgoods. Aeriform, with 29 locations and 240 employees in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas, generated annual revenue of $65 million. In November 2006, the Company purchased the Union Industrial Gas Group, a distributor of industrial gases and related hardgoods. The Union Industrial Gas Group, with 14 locations and 100 employees in New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana, had annual revenue of $38 million. In January 2007, the Company purchased CFC Refimax, a leading full service refrigerant supplier and reclamation company. CFC Refimax, based in Atlanta, Georgia with 50 employees, generated annual revenue of $19 million. In March 2007, the Company completed the Linde Bulk Gas acquisition. The Linde Bulk Gas acquisition, consisting of eight air separation units (ASUs) and 300 employees, produced annual revenue of $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The total aggregate purchase price for the fiscal 2007 acquisitions was $688 million, of which $495 million was paid for the Linde Bulk Gas acquisition. 30 Table of Contents Financing In July 2006, the Company amended and restated its senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The increased borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility provided the Company with financing to close the March 2007 Linde Bulk Gas acquisition, refinance $100 million of its 7.75% medium term notes in September 2006, and redeem its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes (the Notes). The Notes, which would have matured on October 1, 2011, were redeemed at a premium of 104.563% of the principal amount with borrowings under the Companys credit facility. In conjunction with the redemption of the Notes, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax), or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 31 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 13% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 driven by strong same store sales growth of 8% and acquisition growth of 5%. Same store sales growth reflected pricing initiatives, volume growth, and strategic product sales gains, driven by the continued strength of the industrial production, energy and infrastructure construction markets served by the Company. The Company estimates same store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from All Other Operations to the Distribution business segment. Net Sales (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 2,691,814 $ 2,395,938 $ 295,876 12 % All Other Operations 579,671 493,430 86,241 17 % Intercompany eliminations (66,434 ) (59,758 ) (6,676 ) $ 3,205,051 $ 2,829,610 $ 375,441 13 % Distribution business segment sales increased 12% compared to fiscal 2006 driven by same store sales growth of $200 million (8%) and sales contributed by acquisitions of $96 million (4%). The increase in Distribution same store sales resulted from higher hardgoods sales of $95 million (8%) and gas and rent sales growth of $105 million (8%). Broad demand from industrial, energy, and infrastructure construction sectors helped the Companys core gas and welding hardgoods business. Several of the Companys business units reported double digit growth. Sales growth was also driven by double digit growth of strategic products sales. Fiscal 2007 acquisitions attributable to the Distribution business segment historically generated annual revenue of approximately $300 million. The largest of the fiscal 2007 acquisitions closed in the second half of the fiscal year, with the Linde Bulk Gas acquisition closing in March 2007. The Distribution business segments gas and rent same store sales increase of 8% reflects both price increases and volume growth. Sales of industrial gases during fiscal 2007 remained strong reflecting demand from the Companys core industrial markets. Sales of strategic gas products increased 11% in fiscal 2007 driven by bulk, medical and specialty gas sales gains. Bulk gas sales volumes were up related to growth in micro bulk and the signing of new bulk customer contracts. Medical gas sales growth was attributable to higher demand from the hospital sector as well as success of the Walk O2 Bout medical cylinder program. Rental revenues benefited from the Companys rental welder business that generated 33% same store sales growth in fiscal 2007. The rebuilding effort in the Gulf Coast area, power plant construction projects and the strong infrastructure construction market contributed to the increase in demand for welding machines, gases and consumables. Hardgoods same store sales growth reflects continued volume and pricing gains. The Companys successful RADNOR private label brand of products generated sales growth of 11% in fiscal 2007, reaching a total of $128 million. Same store sales of safety products increased 10% reflecting the success of the telemarketing operations (telesales) and effective cross selling of safety products to new and existing customers. All Other Operations business segments sales increased $86 million (17%) compared to fiscal 32 Table of Contents 2006 resulting from same store sales growth and acquisitions. Same store sales growth of 8% was driven by continued sales gains of National Welders and growth in carbon dioxide products. Sales of dry ice and liquid carbon dioxide were strong contributors to sales growth in fiscal 2007 reflecting success in the food processing and industrial carbon dioxide markets and the Companys nationwide network of Penguin dry ice retail locations. Sales growth from acquisitions primarily reflects a fiscal 2006 acquisition of a packaged gas distributor by National Welders. Fiscal 2007 acquisitions reflected in the All Other Operations business segment include CFC Refimax, and the Linde Bulk Gas business. Fiscal 2007 acquisitions did not significantly impact the fiscal years sales growth as they closed in the fourth quarter. Gross Profits Gross profits increased 15% principally from sales growth and acquisitions. The gross margin was 51.1% compared to 50.5% in fiscal 2006. Gross Profit (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 1,336,447 $ 1,172,503 $ 163,944 14 % All Other Operations 301,514 255,129 46,385 18 % $ 1,637,961 $ 1,427,632 $ 210,329 15 % The Distribution business segments gross profits increased $164 million (14%) compared to fiscal 2006. The Distribution segments gross margin was 49.6% versus 48.9% in fiscal 2006. The increase in the gross margin of 70 basis points reflected the impact of price increases as well as a favorable shift in product mix toward and within gas and rent. Gas and rent as a percentage of the Distribution business segments sales was 52.0% compared to 51.7% in fiscal 2006. The All Other Operations business segments gross profits increased $46 million (18%) primarily from strong sales growth at National Welders and sales volume growth of carbon dioxide products. The segments gross margin increased 30 basis points to 52.0% versus 51.7% in fiscal 2006 driven by improvement in pricing and margin expansion, particularly with respect to the anhydrous ammonia product line acquired in June 2005. Operating Expenses As a percentage of net sales, SDA expense decreased 50 basis points to 35.9% compared to 36.4% in fiscal 2006 reflecting improved cost leverage and effective cost management. The decrease in SDA expense as a percentage of sales occurred despite $15.4 million, or approximately 50 basis points, of stock based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 (as described in the Overview section above). There was no stock based compensation expense in fiscal 2006. SDA expenses increased $118 million (11%) primarily from higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes and the operating costs of acquired businesses. Acquisitions contributed estimated incremental SDA expenses of approximately $30 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in SDA expense attributable to factors other than stock based compensation and acquisitions was approximately $72 million, or an increase of 7%, primarily attributable to salaries and wages and distribution related expenses. The increase in salaries and wages reflected increased operational headcounts and overtime to fill cylinders, deliver products and operate facilities to meet increased customer demand. The increase in distribution expenses was attributable to higher fuel and vehicle repair and maintenance costs, which were up approximately $12 million versus fiscal 2006. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise in diesel fuel prices and the increase in miles driven to support related sales growth. Operating expenses in fiscal 2006 included $2.2 million associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 33 Table of Contents Depreciation expense of $139 million increased $16 million (13%) compared to fiscal 2006. Acquired businesses added approximately $3 million of depreciation expense. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects fiscal 2007 and 2006 capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand, primarily cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders, as well as the addition of new fill plants and branch stores. Amortization expense of $9 million was $3 million higher than fiscal 2006 driven by the amortization of customer lists and non compete agreements associated with acquisitions. Operating Income Operating income increased 27% in fiscal 2007 driven by higher sales levels and margin improvement. Improved cost leverage on sales growth was the primary contributor to a 120 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 10.7% compared to 9.5% in fiscal 2006. Operating Income (In thousands) 2007 2006 Increase Distribution $ 266,708 $ 208,466 $ 58,242 28 % All Other Operations 74,744 60,292 14,452 24 % $ 341,452 $ 268,758 $ 72,694 27 % Operating income in the Distribution business segment increased 28% in fiscal 2007. The Distribution business segments operating margin increased 120 basis points to 9.9% compared to 8.7% in fiscal 2006. The significant margin improvement was driven by continued operating profit leverage on sales growth and effective management of costs and pricing. Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment increased 24% compared to fiscal 2006. The segments operating income margin of 12.9% was 70 basis points higher than 12.2% in fiscal 2006. The increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the strong business momentum of National Welders and the improved anhydrous ammonia business. Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $74 million representing an increase of 17% compared to fiscal 2006. The increase primarily resulted from higher average debt levels associated with acquisitions, a larger securitization program and higher weighted average interest rates related to the Companys variable rate debt instruments, partially offset by the refinancing of higher fixed rate debt, as discussed in the Overview section. The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $264 million at March 31, 2007 versus $244 million at March 31, 2006. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. 34 Table of Contents Loss on Debt Extinguishment On October 27, 2006, the Company redeemed its $225 million 9.125% senior subordinated notes at a premium of 104.563% with borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company recognized a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax), or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The charge related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.8% of pre tax earnings in fiscal 2007 compared to 37.4% in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate reflects a tax benefit associated with changes in state income tax law in Texas, which reduced the effective tax rate by 0.7%. Additionally, the fiscal 2007 tax rate reflects the limited deductibility of stock based compensation associated with the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the absence of state tax benefits associated with the loss on the extinguishment of debt. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2006 reflected favorable changes in valuation allowances associated with state tax net operating loss carryforwards and a favorable adjustment to previously recorded tax liabilities. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 was $154 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, which reflects an after tax loss of $7.9 million from the early extinguishment of debt, or $0.10 per diluted share, stock based compensation expense of $10.9 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share, and $1.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, tax benefit associated with changes in state income tax law. Income from continuing operations in fiscal 2006 was $128 million, or $1.62 per diluted share. Stock based compensation expense was not recognized in fiscal 2006. Loss from Discontinued Operations In December 2005, the Company divested its business unit Rutland Tool Supply Co., Inc. (Rutland Tool). Consequently, the operating results of Rutland Tool for fiscal 2006 are reflected as discontinued operations. For fiscal 2006, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.4 million, which principally represented a loss on the sale of the business. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Effective March 31, 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, (FIN 47), and recorded a $2.5 million after tax charge ($0.03 per diluted share) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Net Earnings Fiscal 2007 net earnings were $154 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $124 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. 35 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2008 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $550 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $326 million in fiscal 2007. Net earnings adjusted for non cash and non operating items provided cash of $508 million versus $384 million in the prior year. Working capital resulted in a use of cash of $51 million versus a use of $77 million in the prior year. The use of cash for working capital in fiscal 2008 principally reflects a higher level of inventory and trade receivables associated with sales growth. In connection with an amendment in fiscal 2008 that expanded the size of the trade receivables securitization program, the Company increased the amount of receivables sold under the program, which provided cash of $96 million. The cash provided by the securitization program was used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit line. Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were used to repay debt incurred through the acquisition of businesses, as well as to fund investing activities such as capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2008 totaled $739 million and primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash of $480 million was paid in the current year for 18 acquisitions, including the Linde Packaged Gas acquisition, and acquisition holdback settlements. Capital expenditures of $267 million reflected investments to support the Companys sales growth initiatives, such as air separation plants being constructed in Carrollton, Kentucky and New Carlisle, Indiana. The Company has also continued to invest in its core business through purchasing cylinders and bulk tanks. Financing activities provided net cash of $207 million primarily from net borrowings under the Companys portfolio of debt funding sources (see Financial Instruments discussed below). Other sources of cash effectively offset the uses of cash within financing activities. Dividends At the end of June, September and December 2007, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.09 per share. In January 2008, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share, representing a 33% increase from the previous quarterly dividend. The dividend declared in January 2008 was paid at the end of March 2008. On May 20, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share, which is payable on June 30, 2008 to stockholders of record as of June 12, 2008. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 and $0.06 per share, respectively. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. 36 Table of Contents Financial Instruments Senior Credit Facility The Company maintains a senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The $1.7 billion senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility) permits the Company to borrow up to $1,066 million under a U.S. dollar revolving credit line, up to C$40 million (U.S. $39 million) under a Canadian dollar revolving credit line and up to $600 million under two or more term loans. The Company used borrowings under the term loan provision of the Credit Facility to finance the $100 million maturity of its 7.75% medium term notes on September 15, 2006. The remaining $500 million term loan was used to finance the Linde Bulk Gas acquisition that closed on March 9, 2007. The Credit Facility will mature on July 25, 2011. As of March 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $1,371 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility: $859 million under the U.S. dollar revolver, C$25 million (U.S. $24 million) under the Canadian dollar revolver and $488 million under the term loans. The term loans are repayable in quarterly installments of $22.5 million through June 30, 2010. The quarterly installments then increase to $71.2 million from September 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011. Principal payments due in fiscal 2009 on the term loans are classified as Long term debt in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, based on the Companys ability and intention to refinance the payments with borrowings under its long term revolving credit facilities. The Company also had outstanding letters of credit of $35 million issued under the Credit Facility. The U.S. dollar borrowings and the term loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points and the Canadian dollar borrowings bear interest at the Canadian Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 75 basis points. As of March 31, 2008, the average effective interest rates on the U.S. dollar borrowings, the rate on the term loans and the average Canadian dollar borrowings were 3.62%, 3.45% and 4.50%, respectively. Total Borrowing Capacity As of March 31, 2008, approximately $171 million remained unused under the U.S. dollar revolving credit line and approximately C$15 million (U.S. $15 million) remained unused under the Canadian dollar revolving credit line. As of March 31, 2008, the financial covenants of the Credit Facility permitted the Company to increase its total borrowings under the Credit Facility or through other debt instruments by approximately $847 million. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment and breach covenants. In the event of default, repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility may be accelerated. The Companys domestic subsidiaries, exclusive of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity (the domestic subsidiaries), guarantee the U.S. and Canadian borrowings. The Canadian borrowings are also guaranteed by the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees are full and unconditional and are made on a joint and several basis. The Company has pledged 100% of the stock of its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries as surety for its obligations under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for the release of the guarantees and collateral if the Company attains an investment grade credit rating and a similar release on all other debt. The Company continues to look for acquisition candidates. The financial covenant calculations of the Credit Facility include the pro forma results of acquired businesses. Therefore, total borrowing capacity is not reduced dollar for dollar with acquisition financing. 37 Table of Contents The Company continually evaluates alternative financing and believes that it could obtain financing on reasonable terms. The terms of any future financing arrangements depend on market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time. Money Market Loans The Company has an agreement with a financial institution that provides access to short term advances not to exceed $30 million for a maximum term of three months. The agreement expires on June 30, 2008, but is expected to be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March 31, 2008, the Company had an outstanding advance under the agreement of $30 million, which bears interest at 3.32%. The Company also entered into an agreement with another financial institution that provides access to short term advances not to exceed $35 million. The advances are generally for overnight or up to seven days. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March 31, 2008, there were no short term advances outstanding under this agreement. Senior Subordinated Notes At March 31, 2008, the Company had $150 million of senior subordinated notes (the 2004 Notes) outstanding with a maturity date of July 15, 2014. The 2004 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2004 Notes have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2004 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is July 15, 2009 at a price of 103.125% of the principal amount. The 2004 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The 2004 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the Credit Facility. Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long term debt also included acquisition and other notes principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2008, acquisition and other notes totaled $29.3 million and had an average interest rate of approximately 6%, and an average life maturity of approximately two years. Refinancing of National Welders Debt Effective July 3, 2007, the Company amended its Credit Facility to increase the size of its U.S. dollar revolving credit line by $100 million to $1,066 million. As discussed in Note 13 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, National Welders became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company on July 3, 2007. Concurrently, National Welders debt of $87.5 million was refinanced by the Company under the expanded U.S. dollar revolving credit line. 38 Table of Contents Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis. In December 2007, the Company amended the agreement adding its 100% owned subsidiaries, National Welders and Airgas Merchant Gases, LLC, as originators of trade receivables and expanded the size of the facility to $360 million. The agreement will expire in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. During the year ended March 31, 2008, the Company sold $3.75 billion of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $3.65 billion in collections on those receivables. The amount of receivables sold under the agreement was $360 million at March 31, 2008 and $264 million at March 31, 2007. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The Companys involvement with derivative instruments is limited to highly effective fixed interest rate swap agreements used to manage well defined interest rate risk exposures. At March 31, 2008, the Company had nineteen fixed interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $602 million. These swaps effectively convert $602 million of variable interest rate debt associated with the Companys Credit Facility to fixed rate debt. At March 31, 2008, these swap agreements required the Company to make fixed interest payments based on a weighted average effective rate of 4.94% and receive variable interest payments from the counterparties based on a weighted average variable rate of 2.90%. The remaining terms of each of these swap agreements range from 2 to 30 months. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties. As of March 31, 2008, the Companys ratio of fixed to variable rate debt was 40% fixed to 60% variable, including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization. A majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over LIBOR. Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio at March 31, 2008, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase by approximately $3 million. OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets and business insurance reserves. Uncertainties about future events make these estimates susceptible to change. Management evaluates these estimates regularly and believes they are the best estimates, appropriately made, given the known facts and circumstances. For the three years ended March 31, 2008, there were no material changes in the valuation methods or assumptions used by management. However, actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are critical due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for these matters, their susceptibility to change and the potential impact that different assumptions could have on operating performance. 39 Table of Contents Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes sales returns, sales allowances, and bad debts. The allowance adjusts the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on estimates of accounts that will not ultimately be collected. An allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established as trade receivables age beyond their due date. As past due balances age, higher valuation allowances are established lowering the net carrying value of receivables. The amount of valuation allowance established for each past due period reflects the Companys historical collections experience and current economic conditions and trends. The Company also establishes valuation allowances for specific problem accounts and bankruptcies. The amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions, the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions, the financial condition of individual customers, and the terms of reorganization for accounts emerging from bankruptcy. Changes in these conditions impact the Companys collection experience and may result in the recognition of higher or lower valuation allowances. Management evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company has a low concentration of credit risk due to its broad and diversified customer base across multiple industries and geographic locations, and its relatively low average order size. No individual customer accounts for more than 0.5% of the Companys annual sales. Historically, the Companys sales returns, sales allowances, and bad debts have been in the range of 1.4% to 1.7% of sales. Inventories The Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of the products the Company carries in inventory have long shelf lives and are not subject to technological obsolescence. The Company writes its inventory down to its estimated market value when it believes the market value is below cost. The Company estimates its ability to recover the costs of items in inventory by product type based on its age, the rate at which that product line is turning in inventory, its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The ability of the Company to recover its cost for products in inventory can be affected by factors such as future customer demand, general market conditions and the relationship with significant suppliers. Management evaluates the recoverability of its inventory at least quarterly. In aggregate, inventory turns at just over four times per year. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS 142). Under SFAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October 31 of each year or whenever indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value. Implied fair value is estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis for each reporting unit. The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. The Companys analysis uses internally generated budgets and long range forecasts, which are the same budgets and forecasts used for managing operations, awarding management bonuses and seeking alternative or additional financing. The Companys discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in these budgets and forecasts about sales trends, inflation, working capital needs, and forecasted capital expenditures along with an estimate of the reporting units terminal value (the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period) to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys assumptions about working capital needs and capital expenditures are based on historical 40 Table of Contents experience. Terminal values reflect an assumed perpetual growth rate consistent with long term expectations for inflation. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows is a risk adjusted rate consistent with the weighted average cost of capital of peer group companies for a term equal to the forecast period. The Company believes the assumptions used in its discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, the Company may not meet its sales growth and profitability targets, working capital needs and capital expenditures may be higher than forecast, changes in credit markets may result in changes to the Companys discount rate and general business conditions may result in changes to the Companys terminal value assumptions for its reporting units. Based on the October 31, 2007 assessment, the Company does not expect that such changes would result in the recognition of goodwill impairment in the Companys reporting units. Business Insurance Reserves The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile, and general liability claims. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, these programs had self insured retention of $1 million per occurrence. During fiscal 2006, the Companys self insured retention was $500 thousand per occurrence with an additional aggregate retention of $2.2 million for claims in excess of $500 thousand. For fiscal 2009, the self insured retention will remain $1 million per occurrence with no additional aggregate retention. The Company reserves for its self insured retention based on individual claim evaluations establishing loss estimates for known claims based on the current facts and circumstances. These known claims are then developed through actuarial computations, to reflect the expected ultimate loss for the known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Actuarial computations use the Companys specific loss history, payment patterns, insurance coverage, plus industry trends and other factors to estimate the required reserve for all open claims by policy year and loss type. Reserves for the Companys self insurance retention are evaluated monthly. Semi annually, the Company obtains a third party actuarial report to validate that the computations and assumptions used are consistent with actuarial standards. Certain assumptions used in the actuarial computations are susceptible to change. Loss development factors are influenced by items such as medical inflation, changes in workers compensation laws, and changes in the Companys loss payment patterns, all of which can have a significant influence on the estimated ultimate loss related to the Companys self insured retention. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of open claims may be for amounts more or less than the reserve balances. The Companys operations are spread across a significant number of locations, which helps to mitigate the potential impact of any given event that could give rise to an insurance related loss. Over the last three years, business insurance expense has generally been in the range of 0.6% to 0.9% of sales. 41 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table presents the Companys contractual obligations as of March 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Less than More than 5 Contractual Obligations: Total 1 Years (a) 1 to 3 Years (a) 3 to 5 Years (a) Years (a) Long term debt (1) $ 1,580,048 $ 40,400 $ 341,696 $ 1,046,695 $ 151,257 Estimated interest payments on long term debt (2) 208,150 59,605 106,293 30,020 12,232 Estimated payments on interest rate swap agreements (3) 20,850 13,635 5,851 1,364 Non compete agreements (4) 17,144 3,712 5,758 3,533 4,141 Letters of credit (5) 35,099 35,099 Operating leases (6) 292,799 76,530 129,127 62,747 24,395 Purchase obligations: Liquid bulk gas supply agreements (7) 862,164 115,916 188,938 174,048 383,262 Liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements (8) 202,092 17,184 29,027 24,224 131,657 Ammonia supply agreements (9) 21,706 21,706 Other purchase commitments (10) 11,754 11,754 Construction commitments (11) 46,854 46,854 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,298,660 $ 442,395 $ 806,690 $ 1,342,631 $ 706,944 (a) The less than one year relates to obligations due in fiscal 2009. The 1 to 3 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ending March 31, 2010 and 2011. The 3 to 5 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ending March 31, 2012 and 2013. The more than 5 years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ending March 31, 2014 and beyond. (1) Aggregate long term debt instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2008. Long term debt includes capital lease obligations, which were not material and, therefore, did not warrant separate disclosure. Principal payments on the term loan under the Credit Facility are not reflected in the Less than 1 year column above due to the Companys ability and intention to refinance the payments with borrowings under its long term revolving credit line. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding long term debt instruments. (2) The future interest payments on the Companys long term debt obligations were estimated based on the current outstanding principal reduced by scheduled maturities in each period presented and interest rates as of March 31, 2008. The estimated interest payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of long term debt outstanding and actual interest rates in future periods. (3) Payments or receipts under interest rate swap agreements result from changes in market interest rates compared to contractual rates and payments to be exchanged between the parties to the agreements. The estimated receipts in future periods were determined based on forward LIBOR rates as of March 31, 2008. Actual receipts or payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual interest rates in future periods. At March 31, 2008, the net liability associated with the portfolio of interest rate swap agreements will increase or decrease between $4.2 million and $4.5 million for every 50 basis point increase or decrease in LIBOR. 42 Table of Contents (4) Non compete agreements are obligations of the Company to make scheduled future payments, generally to former owners of acquired businesses, contingent upon their compliance with the covenants of the non compete agreement. (5) Letters of credit are guarantees of payment to third parties. The Companys letters of credit principally back obligations associated with the Companys self insured retention on workers compensation, automobile and general liability claims. The letters of credit are supported by the Companys Credit Facility. (6) The Companys operating leases at March 31, 2008 include approximately $168 million in fleet vehicles under long term operating leases. The Company guarantees a residual value of $29 million related to its leased vehicles. (7) In addition to the gas volumes supplied by the recently acquired Airgas Merchant Gases (formerly Linde Gas LLC), the Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases. The Company has a long term take or pay supply agreement, in effect through August 31, 2017, with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) to supply the Company with bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon. Additionally, the Company purchases helium and hydrogen gases from Air Products under long term supply agreements. Based on the volume of fiscal 2008 purchases, the Air Products supply agreements represent approximately $50 million annually in liquid bulk gas purchases. The Company also has long term take or pay supply agreements with Linde to purchase oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium and acetylene. The agreements expire at various dates through July 2019 and represent almost $50 million in annual bulk gas purchases. Additionally, the Company has long term take or pay supply agreements to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon from other major producers. Annual purchases under these contracts are approximately $16 million and they expire at various dates through 2024. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2008 purchases. The supply agreements noted above contain periodic adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analysis. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are well within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. (8) The Company is a party to long term take or pay supply agreements for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide with approximately 15 suppliers that expire at various dates through 2044. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2008 purchases. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are well within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the carbon dioxide supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. Certain of the liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements contain market pricing subject to certain economic indices. (9) The Company purchases ammonia from a variety of sources. With one of those sources, the Company has minimum purchase commitments under a supply agreement. The term of the agreement is through December 31, 2008 and automatically renews for successive one year terms unless terminated by either party upon 180 days written notice. 43 Table of Contents (10) Other purchase commitments primarily include property, plant and equipment expenditures. (11) Construction commitments represent outstanding commitments to customers to build and operate air separation plants in New Carlisle, IN and Carrollton, KY, and construct a beverage grade liquid carbon dioxide plant in Deer Park, TX, which is expected to be completed in early calendar year 2009. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As disclosed in Note 4 to the Companys consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the Company participates in a securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell, on a revolving basis, up to $360 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. Under the securitization agreement, on a monthly basis, trade receivables are sold to three commercial banks through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. The Company retains a subordinated interest in the receivables sold, which is included in trade receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2008, the amount of retained interest in the receivables sold was approximately $165 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $22 million. The securitization agreement is a form of off balance sheet financing. The discount taken by the commercial banks reduces the proceeds from the sale of trade receivables and is generally at a lower cost than the Company can borrow under its Credit Facility. The table below reflects the amount of trade receivables sold at March 31, 2008 and the amount of the anticipated discount to be taken, based on market rates at March 31, 2008, on the sale of that quantity of receivables each month through the expiration date of the securitization agreement. The Company is not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its expiration date. (In thousands) Payments Due by Period Off balance sheet obligations as of Less than 1 More than 5 March 31, 2008: Total Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years Years Trade receivables securitization $ 360,000 $ $ 360,000 $ $ Estimated discount on securitization 21,600 10,800 10,800 Total off balance sheet obligations $ 381,600 $ 10,800 $ 370,800 $ $ 44 Table of Contents Accounting PronouNcements Issued But Not Yet Adopted Business Combinations In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141R, Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R), which replaces SFAS 141. SFAS 141R will significantly change the way the Company accounts for business combinations. The more significant changes under SFAS 141R included the treatment of contingent consideration, preacquisition contingencies, transaction costs, in process research and development and restructuring costs. The standard also require more assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and contingent liabilities assumed will be measured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS 141R for acquisitions completed after April 1, 2009 and is currently assessing the impact of SFAS 141R on the consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157). This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to the fair value requirements as applicable in other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 until January 1, 2009 for all non financial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities as well as non financial assets and liabilities excluded from the deferral above. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 157 and has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Option In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, (SFAS 159), which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value in an attempt to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 159 and has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements. Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, (SFAS 160), which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require 1) non controlling interests held by non parent parties be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separate from the parents equity and 2) the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest be clearly presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. SFAS 160 also requires consistent reporting of any changes to the parents ownership while retaining a controlling financial interest, as well as specific guidelines over how to treat the deconsolidation of controlling interests and any applicable gains or loses. This statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008; earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this statement on the consolidated financial statements. 45 Table of Contents Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the FASB issued the SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivatives and Hedging Activities, (SFAS 161), which enhances the requirements under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivatives and hedging activities and how they affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact to our consolidated financial statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Companys borrowing agreements. Interest rate swap agreements are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company has not established, and will not establish, any interest risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources. Counterparties to interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long term credit ratings of A or better. In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non performance by the counterparties. The table below summarizes the Companys market risks associated with long term debt obligations, interest rate swaps and LIBOR based agreements as of March 31, 2008. For debt obligations and trade receivables securitization, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate swaps, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period.

The variable interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolving credit line are based on a spread over LIBOR applicable to each tranche under the U.S. credit line. The average of the variable interest rates on the Canadian dollar portion of the Credit Facility is based on a spread over Canadian Bankers Acceptances applicable to each tranche under the Canadian credit line. (b) The trade receivables securitization agreement expires in March 2010, but may be renewed subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. (c) The notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the term loans principal payments due through March 31, 2009 as long term based on the Companys ability and intention to refinance those principal payments with its revolving credit line. Estimated interest payments on the term loans reflect the amortization of the term loans principal for each period presented. Limitations of the Tabular Presentation As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March 31, 2008, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Companys credit rating. Foreign Currency Rate Risk Canadian subsidiaries of the Company are funded with local currency debt. The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 49 Table of Contents
