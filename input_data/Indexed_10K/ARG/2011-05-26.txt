ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 OVERVIEW Airgas had net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 (fiscal 2011 or current year) of $4.3 billion compared to $3.9 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 (fiscal 2010 or prior year), an increase of 10%. Total same store sales increased 8%, with hardgoods up 11% and gas and rent up 7%. Acquisitions contributed 2% sales growth in the current year. The same store sales growth for the current year was driven by both volume and price, with sales volumes up 5% and pricing up 3%. The increase in sales volumes reflects accelerating growth in the Companys core business on strength in the manufacturing, utilities and petrochemical customer segments, as the manufacturing recovery that began in the central regions of the U.S. among the Companys larger customers expanded more broadly throughout the country and to smaller manufacturers. The Companys medical business also began to accelerate, and the Company experienced increased activity in customers using Airgas products and services for repair and maintenance operations. The increase in pricing reflects a broad based price increase on gas, rent and hardgoods effective June 1, 2010, and to a lesser extent, a price increase on gas, rent and other service charges on March 1, 2011. The pricing actions were designed to offset rising product, operating and distribution costs. The Companys operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 11.0% in the current year compared to 10.3% in the prior year. The current years operating income margin reflected a 110 basis point improvement in the operating income margin driven by operating leverage on sales growth in the current year, offset by $44.4 million in costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and $4.6 million in charges related to the Companys withdrawal from some of its multi employer pension plans (MEPPs), which together reduced the Companys operating income margin by 120 basis points. The Companys operating income margin in the prior year reflected the impact of $23.4 million in costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges, which reduced the prior years operating income margin by 80 basis points. Net earnings per diluted share rose 25% to $2.93 in the current year versus $2.34 in the prior year. Net earnings per diluted share in the current year included special charges aggregating to $0.41 per diluted share comprised of $0.33 per diluted share in costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, $0.03 per diluted share in MEPP withdrawal charges, $0.03 per diluted share in losses on the extinguishment of debt and $0.02 per diluted share for a one time interest penalty. Net earnings per diluted share in the prior year included net special charges aggregating to $0.34 per diluted share comprised of $0.18 per diluted share in costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, $0.05 per diluted share in MEPP withdrawal charges, $0.14 per diluted share in losses on the extinguishment of debt and a $0.03 per diluted share income tax benefit associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment. The special charges reduced reported net earnings per diluted share by 12% in fiscal 2011 and 13% in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2012 Outlook Looking forward, the Company expects earnings per diluted share for the first quarter ending June 30, 2011 in the range of $0.82 to $0.87. The earnings per diluted share range for the first quarter includes an estimated $0.10 per diluted share of restructuring charges and $0.08 per diluted share of implementation costs and depreciation expense associated with the Companys SAP implementation. For the full year ending March 31, 2012 (fiscal 2012), the Company expects earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.58 to $3.73, which includes an estimated $0.17 per diluted share of restructuring charges and $0.32 per diluted share of implementation costs and depreciation expense associated with its SAP implementation. Guidance for both the first quarter ending June 30, 2011 and fiscal 2012 also includes the impact of the Companys repurchase of 4.8 million shares of common stock completed in the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The above guidance excludes any potential MEPP withdrawal charges that may arise from the three remaining collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), covering approximately 30 employees who participate in MEPPs, that come up for renewal in fiscal 2012, and excludes the impact, if any, of the new share repurchase program announced on May 5, 2011. Enterprise Information System The Company continues its phased, multi year rollout of its highly customized SAP enterprise information system, with the successful conversion of the first regional distribution company on April 4, 2011. The Company continues to prepare for the implementation of SAP at the remainder of its business units, the next of which is scheduled to convert in September 2011. The conversion schedule accelerates thereafter, with all regional distribution companies expected to be converted to SAP by the first half of fiscal 2013. 17 Table of Contents The Company expects to incur the highest level of expenses related to the SAP implementation in fiscal 2012, as the majority of the regional distribution companies are converted during the year. Total implementation costs and depreciation expense related to the SAP system are expected to be $0.08 per diluted share for the quarter ending June 30, 2011 and $0.32 per diluted share for fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, the Company quantified the economic benefits expected to be achieved through its implementation of SAP in the key areas of accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management, and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, the Company expects these areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis. By December 2013, the Company expects to be at the run rate of the mid point of the target operating income benefits range. Excluding depreciation, total SAP project expenditures are expected to be approximately $186 million, with an estimated $91 million in expense and $95 million in capitalized costs. Through March 31, 2011, the Company had recognized $116 million in total SAP project expenditures, with $29 million in expense and $87 million in capitalized costs. New Divisional Alignment In conjunction with the SAP implementation, in May 2011, the Company announced a reorganization of its twelve regional distribution companies. Currently, each of the regional distribution companies operates with its own accounting group and administrative functions. In order to more effectively utilize the Companys resources across regional company boundaries, Airgas will realign its regional company support functions, including accounting and certain administrative functions, into four divisional Business Support Centers. With the Companys conversion to a single dataset across all of the regional companies as part of the SAP implementation, the consolidation of the Companys regional company accounting and certain administrative functions will support the efficiencies expected to be realized as part of the SAP project. As a result of the reorganization, the Company will incur restructuring charges, including severance, transition staffing, relocation and other costs. In fiscal 2012, the Company expects to incur restructuring charges of $21 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, of which $13 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, is expected to occur in the first quarter ending June 30, 2011 primarily related to severance. The reorganization is expected to be complete in fiscal 2013, and the Company expects to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $6 million, primarily related to transition staffing, relocation and other costs during such fiscal year. The benefits enabled by the new divisional alignment are included in the benefits expected to be realized from the SAP implementation quantified above. Stock Repurchase Program On May 5, 2011, the Company announced a new program to repurchase up to $300 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The Company may repurchase shares from time to time for cash in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The Company will determine the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. The stock repurchase program will be funded under the Companys existing credit facility, has no pre established closing date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The impact of the May 2011 stock repurchase program has not been included in the Companys forward looking guidance. Multi employer Pension Plan Withdrawals During fiscal 2012, the three remaining CBAs that provide for MEPPs and cover a total of approximately 30 employees will come up for renewal. The Company intends to negotiate its withdrawal from these plans and, if successful in its negotiations, expects to incur charges related to these plans in fiscal 2012. Assuming a complete withdrawal from these MEPPs, the Company estimates the additional withdrawal liability to be approximately $5 million as of March 31, 2011. The Companys guidance for both the first quarter ending June 30, 2011 and the full year fiscal 2012 does not include any potential MEPP withdrawal charges that may arise from the three remaining CBAs that come up for renewal in fiscal 2012. Supply Constraints The industrial gas industry is working through supply constraints related to calcium carbide, which is the raw material used in the generation of acetylene gas, as a result of a catastrophic explosion at one of two plants of the countrys primary supplier of calcium carbide. Due to the calcium carbide supply disruption, costs of acetylene are escalating as a result of both rising raw materials and distribution costs. The Company is utilizing a combination of alternatives to compensate for the lack of calcium carbide, including increased use of chemical acetylene, reallocation of available calcium carbide, potential sourcing of calcium carbide from outside of the U.S. and customer adoption of alternative fuel gases where appropriate. To help mitigate the financial impact to Airgas, the Company has already instituted product allocations and surcharges related to bulk and cylinder acetylene. Sales of acetylene represent approximately 3% of the Companys consolidated gas and rent net sales. 18 Table of Contents STATEMENT OF EARNINGS COMMENTARY Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2010 Certain reclassifications were made to the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal years 2010 and 2009 to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications resulted in increasing revenue and selling, distribution and administrative expenses and reducing cost of products sold (excluding depreciation). These reclassifications were the result of conforming the Companys accounting policies in conjunction with its implementation of the SAP system and were not material. Consolidated operating income and net earnings for the prior periods were not impacted by the reclassifications. Additionally, certain reclassifications were made to the presentation of business segment operating results for the prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications were the result of changes made to the allocation of corporate operating expenses. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and costs associated with the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs under selling, distribution and administrative expenses as other expenses that are not allocated to the Companys business segments. Previously, these costs were allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars. Consolidated operating income and net earnings for the prior periods were not impacted by these reclassifications. Additionally, the legal and professional fees incurred as a result of Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt were not allocated to the Companys business segments. These costs are also reflected in the other line item in the tables below. Business segment information and income statement commentary related to the prior periods have been recast to reflect the reclassifications described above. Net Sales Net sales increased 10% to $4.3 billion for the current year compared to the prior year, driven by same store sales growth of 8% and incremental sales of 2% contributed by acquisitions. Gas and rent same store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 11%. Same store sales were driven by increased volumes of 5% and price of 3%. Strategic products account for more than 40% of net sales and include safety products, bulk, medical and specialty gases, as well as carbon dioxide and dry ice. The Company has identified these products as strategic because it believes they have good long term growth profiles relative to the Companys core industrial gas and welding products due to favorable end customer markets, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross selling opportunities or a combination thereof. For the current year, sales of strategic products increased 9% on a same store sales basis as compared to the prior year, which was slightly stronger than the overall same store sales increase of 8%. The Company estimates same store sales growth based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from the All Other Operations business segment to the Distribution business segment. Net Sales Year EndedMarch 31, 2011 2010 Increase (In thousands) Distribution $ 3,810,136 $ 3,478,475 $ 331,661 10 % All Other Operations 472,054 420,941 51,113 12 % Intercompany eliminations (30,723 ) (24,263 ) (6,460 ) $ 4,251,467 $ 3,875,153 $ 376,314 10 % The Distribution business segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases, and process chemicals; cylinder and equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, construction supplies and maintenance, repair and operating supplies. 19 Table of Contents Distribution business segment sales increased 10% compared to the prior year with an increase in same store sales of 8% and incremental sales of 2% contributed by current and prior year acquisitions. The Distribution business segments gas and rent same store sales increased 6% with volumes and pricing each up 3%. Hardgoods same store sales increased 11% with volumes up 9% and pricing up 2%. Both gas and rent and hardgoods volumes reflect the overall improvement in economic activity, while the increase in pricing was primarily driven by the June 1, 2010 and March 1, 2011 price increases. Sales of strategic gas products sold through the Distribution business segment in the current year increased 8% from the prior year. Among strategic gas products, bulk gas sales were up 10% as bulk sales to industrial manufacturing and petrochemical customers continued to recover, and bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength. Sales of medical gases were up 4% as a result of new business signings, partially offset by a reduction in elective and non critical medical procedures, which reduced overall demand. Sales of specialty gases were up 8% driven primarily by higher volumes and increased demand for core specialty gases. The rising demand for the Companys core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of the Companys market position in EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, improving conditions in petrochemical markets and spot sales of certain rare gases in the fiscal second quarter. Contributing to the rise in Distribution business segment hardgoods same store sales were increases in both safety products and the Companys Radnor&reg; private label brand product line. Safety product sales increased 13% in the current year, comparing favorably to the overall hardgoods same store sales increase of 11% and reflecting broad based increases that were most pronounced in the manufacturing customer base. The Companys Radnor&reg; private label line was up 15% for the current year, driven by the overall increase in hardgoods volumes. Sales of core industrial gases, which experienced the sharpest volume declines during the recession, increased 6% for the current year as compared to the prior year, reflecting accelerating growth in the Companys core business. Revenues from the Companys rental welder business experienced a 5% decline in same store sales during the current year as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of continued weakness in non residential construction. The All Other Operations business segment consists of six business units. The primary products manufactured and or distributed are carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, ammonia and refrigerant gases. The All Other Operations business segment sales increased 12% in total and on a same store basis compared to the prior year. The sales increase was driven by higher pricing and volumes for certain products in the refrigerants business and for ammonia used in DeNOx applications and chemicals processing, as well as higher volumes in the carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses. Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Gross profits (excluding depreciation) do not reflect deductions related to depreciation expense and distribution costs. The Company reflects distribution costs as an element of selling, distribution and administrative expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings line item, Depreciation. Other companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their cost of products sold and, as such, the Companys gross profits (excluding depreciation) discussed below may not be comparable to those of other businesses. Consolidated gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 9% compared to the prior year, principally due to the same store sales increase for the current year. The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in the current year declined 40 basis points to 55.0% compared to 55.4% in the prior year. The decline in consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) primarily reflects the sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods that is characteristic of an industrial economic recovery. Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Year EndedMarch 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Increase Distribution $ 2,117,270 $ 1,948,868 $ 168,402 9 % All Other Operations 220,107 198,419 21,688 11 % $ 2,337,377 $ 2,147,287 $ 190,090 9 % The Distribution business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 9% compared to the prior year. The Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was 55.6% versus 56.0% in the prior year, a decrease of 40 basis points. The decline in the Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) largely reflects the shift in sales mix toward hardgoods, which carry lower gross profit margins (excluding depreciation) than gas and rent. As a percentage of the Distribution business segments sales, gas and rent decreased 120 basis points to 59.6% in the current year as compared to 60.8% in the prior year. 20 Table of Contents The All Other Operations business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 11% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of favorable pricing and product mix for the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses. The All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) decreased 50 basis points to 46.6% in the current year from 47.1% in the prior year. The decrease in the All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was primarily driven by higher costs in the ammonia business relative to pricing. Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative (SD&A) expenses consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distributing of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. Consolidated SD&A expenses increased $85 million, or 6%, in the current year as compared to the prior year. Contributing to the increase in SD&A expenses were $65 million of higher variable costs associated with growing sales, such as sales commissions, performance bonuses, production overtime and distribution costs, approximately $13 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses and $9 million in incremental costs associated with the SAP implementation, slightly offset by $2 million of lower MEPP withdrawal charges. As a percentage of net sales, SD&A expense decreased 140 basis points to 37.0% compared to 38.4% in the prior year driven by operating leverage on sales growth and by the shift in sales mix to hardgoods, which carry lower operating expenses in relation to sales and corresponding lower gross margins. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports SD&A expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs in the other line item in the table below. SD&A Expenses Year EndedMarch 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Increase Distribution $ 1,418,491 $ 1,348,022 $ 70,469 5 % All Other Operations 134,578 127,250 7,328 6 % Other 21,003 14,033 6,970 $ 1,574,072 $ 1,489,305 $ 84,767 6 % SD&A expenses in the Distribution and All Other Operations business segments increased 5% and 6%, respectively, in the current year. For both business segments, the increases in SD&A costs were driven by higher variable costs on sales growth, including sales commissions, performance bonuses, production overtime and distribution costs, and approximately $13 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses, the majority of which was incurred in the Distribution business segment. As a percentage of Distribution business segment net sales, SD&A expense in the Distribution business segment decreased 160 basis points to 37.2% compared to 38.8% in the prior year driven by operating leverage on sales growth and by the shift in sales mix to hardgoods. As a percentage of All Other Operations business segment net sales, SD&A expense in the All Other Operations business segment decreased 170 basis points to 28.5% compared to 30.2% in the prior year, driven primarily by operating leverage on sales growth in the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses. Enterprise Information System On July 5, 2010, the Company began its phased, multi year rollout of its highly customized SAP enterprise information system, whereby business units will implement the new system in succession, with the successful conversion of its Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure business to SAP. On April 4, 2011, the first regional distribution company successfully converted to SAP. The Company continues to prepare for the implementation of SAP at the remainder of its business units. SAP costs for the current year were $16.4 million as compared to $7.4 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the post implementation monitoring, training and operating activities following the rollout of SAP to the Companys Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure business, and pre implementation data conversion and training related to the rollout of SAP to the first regional distribution company. These costs were recorded as SD&A expenses and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. SAP implementation costs for fiscal 2012 to be reflected in SD&A expenses are expected to increase to $36 million as the Company accelerates the rollout of the system to the other regional distribution companies. Multi employer Pension Plan Withdrawals The Company participates, with other employers, in a number of MEPPs providing defined benefits to union employees under the terms of CBAs. Contributions are made to the plans in accordance with those CBAs. The plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. 21 Table of Contents As CBAs came up for renewal, the Company actively negotiated the withdrawal from MEPPs replacing those retirement plans for CBA employees with defined contribution plans. As part of the withdrawal from a MEPP, the Company is required to fund its portion of the MEPPs unfunded pension obligation. The ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability assessed by the MEPP is impacted by a number of factors, including investment returns, benefits levels and continued participation by other employers in the MEPP. The computation of the Companys portion of a plans unfunded obligation may take up to 24 months for the pension plan administrators to prepare. As a result, the Company has recorded estimated liabilities for these withdrawals based on the latest information available to the Company from the plans. MEPP withdrawal costs for the current year were $4.6 million and related to the ratification of certain CBAs up for renewal as well as revised estimated withdrawal liabilities from two plan administrators. In connection with the renewal of certain labor contracts during the prior year, the Company recognized MEPP withdrawal charges of $6.7 million in the prior year. These charges were reflected in SD&A expenses and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. Unsolicited Takeover Attempt On February 11, 2010, Air Products initiated an unsolicited tender offer for all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with this unsolicited takeover attempt, Air Products filed an action against the Company and members of its Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In the suit, Air Products sought, among other things, an order declaring that members of the Companys Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products. Additionally, a number of purported stockholder class action lawsuits were commenced against the Company and or the members of the Airgas Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. These suits, which were later consolidated, alleged, among other things, that the members of the Airgas Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products, failing to seek more valuable alternatives and failing to redeem the Companys shareholder rights plan. Air Products also initiated a proxy contest to elect three directors to Airgas Board and to amend certain provisions of the Companys By Laws. At the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company on September 15, 2010, the three nominees of Air Products were elected to the Companys Board of Directors and a majority of the shares voted, though less than 67% of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote, were voted in favor of the By Law amendments proposed by Air Products. Airgas and certain of its directors initiated an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that the By Law amendment requiring that an annual meeting be held on January 18, 2011, only four months after the September 15, 2010 annual meeting, was invalid under both Delaware law and Airgas charter. In a ruling dated October 8, 2010, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the By Law amendment was valid. Airgas and the directors involved appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court of Delaware and on November 23, 2010, the Supreme Court of Delaware found that the By Law amendment was invalid and reversed the judgment of the Court of Chancery. On February 15, 2011, the Delaware Court of Chancery denied in their entirety all requests for relief by Air Products and by the plaintiffs in the stockholder class action lawsuits, and dismissed with prejudice all claims asserted against the Company and its directors. Air Products promptly terminated its unsolicited tender offer and no appeal of the Courts decision was filed by Air Products or the stockholder plaintiffs. During the current year, the Company incurred $44.4 million of legal and professional fees and other costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and the related litigation compared to $23.4 million in the prior year. The costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt were reflected as a separate line item in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings, and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense of $225 million increased $13 million, or 6%, in the current year as compared to $213 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand (such as cylinders and bulk tanks) and $2 million of incremental depreciation expense related to the SAP enterprise information system. Amortization expense of $25 million in the current year increased by $3 million as compared to the prior year reflecting amortization of intangibles acquired during both the current and prior years. Depreciation expense related to the SAP system is expected to increase to $8 million in fiscal 2012 without the benefit of full implementation of the system. 22 Table of Contents Operating Income Consolidated operating income of $468 million increased 17% in the current year driven by operating leverage on sales growth which more than offset the impact of costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, higher variable costs associated with sales growth, and incremental SAP implementation costs, slightly offset by lower MEPP withdrawal charges. The consolidated operating income margin, which was negatively impacted by significant costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, increased to 11.0% from 10.3% in the prior year. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports SD&A expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs in the other line item in the table below. Additionally, the legal and professional fees and other costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt are not allocated to the Companys business segments, and are also reflected in the other line item in the table below. Operating Income Year EndedMarch 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Increase Distribution $ 468,295 $ 384,584 $ 83,711 22 % All Other Operations 65,495 52,482 13,013 25 % Other (65,409 ) (37,468 ) (27,941 ) $ 468,381 $ 399,598 $ 68,783 17 % Operating income in the Distribution business segment increased 22% in the current year. The Distribution business segments operating income margin increased 120 basis points to 12.3% compared to 11.1% in the prior year. The operating income margin increase was driven by operating leverage on sales growth in the current year which more than offset higher variable costs associated with sales growth. Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment increased 25% compared to the prior year. The All Other Operations business segments operating income margin of 13.9% was 140 basis points higher than the operating income margin of 12.5% in the prior year. The increase in operating margin was driven primarily by operating leverage on sales growth in the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses, partially offset by the impact of gross margin compression in the ammonia business. Interest Expense, Net, Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt Interest expense, net, was $60 million in the current year, representing a decrease of approximately $9 million, or 13%, compared to interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables in the prior year. As a result of a change in accounting treatment effective April 1, 2010 related to the Companys trade receivables securitization program, costs formerly recognized as discount on securitization of trade receivables, which represented the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale, are now reflected as interest expense, consistent with the new accounting treatment. The overall decrease in interest expense, net (including the discount on securitization of trade receivables in the prior year) resulted primarily from lower average debt balances in the current year as compared to aggregate debt and trade receivables securitization balances in the prior year, partially offset by a $2.6 million one time interest penalty in the current year related to the 7.125% senior subordinated notes due October 1, 2018 (the 2018 Notes). Interest Penalty During the current year, the Company incurred a one time interest penalty to the holders of its 2018 Notes in the amount of $2.6 million related to the late removal of the restrictive legend on these notes. In issuing the 2018 Notes, the Company utilized a newly available technology that has since become obsolete, wherein it was incumbent upon Airgas to remove the restrictive legend from the 2018 Notes at the end of the restricted transfer period. Failure to do so required the payment of an interest penalty to holders of the 2018 Notes, which the Company promptly addressed when it identified the oversight. The Company has classified this penalty as interest expense. 23 Table of Contents Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in the Securitization Agreement with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis. The maximum amount of the Securitization Agreement is $295 million. On April 1, 2010, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which affected the presentation of its Securitization Agreement. Under the new guidance, proceeds received under the Securitization Agreement are treated as secured borrowings, whereas previously they were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables. Furthermore, the new accounting treatment resulted in the recognition of both the trade receivables securitized under the agreement and the borrowings they collateralize on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet, which led to a $295 million increase in trade receivables and long term debt. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated net earnings as a result of the change in accounting principle. Additionally, the Companys debt covenants were not impacted by the balance sheet recognition of the borrowings under the new accounting guidance, as borrowings under the Securitization Agreement were already factored into the debt covenant calculations. Financing and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt On September 13, 2010, the Company entered into a new four year $750 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). In connection with the entry into the Credit Facility, the Company terminated its $1.7 billion credit facility (the Prior Credit Facility), which was scheduled to mature on July 25, 2011. All obligations outstanding under the Prior Credit Facility were repaid using proceeds of the Credit Facility and other funds. As a result of the early termination of the Prior Credit Facility, the Company recognized a loss of $0.6 million associated with the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, during the current year, the Company repurchased $30 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 110.6% of the principal. In conjunction with the repurchase of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $3.6 million. The losses reflected the redemption premiums as well as the write off of associated unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the prior year repurchase of $154 million of the 2018 Notes and the redemption in full of the $150 million 6.25% senior subordinated notes due July 15, 2014 (the 2004 Notes), the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million in the prior year. The losses related to the redemption premiums and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Stock Repurchase Program In February 2011, the Companys Executive Committee of the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that provided the Company with the authorization to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock. By March 31, 2011, 4.8 million shares had been repurchased for $300 million. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.5% of pre tax earnings in the current year compared to 37.5% in the prior year. The lower tax rate for the prior year reflects the impact of tax benefits of $2.2 million associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be between 38.0% and 39.0% of pre tax earnings. Net Earnings Net earnings were $250 million, or $2.93 per diluted share, compared to $196 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, in the prior year. The current years net earnings include costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt of $44.4 million ($28.0 million after tax) or $0.33 per diluted share, charges related to withdrawals from MEPPs of $4.6 million ($2.8 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share, losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million ($2.6 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share and costs related to the one time interest penalty of $2.6 million ($1.7 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. The prior years net earnings include costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt of $23.4 million ($14.8 million after tax) or $0.18 per diluted share, charges related to withdrawals from MEPPs of $6.7 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share, losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million ($11.3 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share and a one time income tax benefit of $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share. 24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 OVERVIEW Airgas had net sales for fiscal 2010 of $3.9 billion compared to $4.4 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009). The fiscal 2010 net sales reflected a challenging sales environment due to the economic downturn in the U.S. For fiscal 2010, net sales decreased by 11% driven by a decline in same store sales offset slightly by the impact of current and prior year acquisitions. The decline in same store sales contributed 14% to the decrease in total sales, driven by a 13% decrease in sales volume and a 1% decrease in pricing. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 3% for fiscal 2010. Lower sales volumes reflected the effects of the economic recession in the U.S. and decreased demand, especially in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, across all customer and geographic segments. Steep declines in the Companys selling price to customers in response to price reductions from the Companys suppliers for ammonia and filler metals accounted for the majority of the pricing decline. The Companys strategic products and related growth initiatives helped to somewhat mitigate the impact of the economic downturn. Operating income margin declined 170 basis points to 10.3% in fiscal 2010 compared to 12.0% in fiscal 2009. The decline in the fiscal 2010 operating income margin reflected the impact of lower sales as well as $23.4 million in costs related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges, partially offset by the impact of cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives and a favorable sales mix shift from hardgoods to gas and rent sales. The costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and the MEPP charges accounted for 80 basis points (44%) of the decline in operating income margin. Net earnings per diluted share fell 25% to $2.34 in fiscal 2010 versus $3.12 in fiscal 2009. The results reflect lower operating income as well as losses on the extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million, partially offset by lower borrowing costs in fiscal 2010 and a $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share income tax benefit associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment. The costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, MEPP charges and debt extinguishment charges accounted for over half of the decline in net earnings per diluted share. Multi employer Pension Plan Withdrawal In connection with the renewal of certain CBAs during fiscal 2010, the Company negotiated its withdrawal from participation in underfunded MEPPs and will instead contribute to a defined contribution plan for the affected union employees. Ratification of the CBAs led to $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009, the Company incurred $2.0 million in MEPP withdrawal charges. Cost Reduction and Operating Efficiency Initiatives In response to the economic downturn, the Company reacted quickly and effectively to mitigate the impact of declining sales. Between December 2008 and September 2009, the Company fully implemented $57 million of annualized expense reductions, which were in addition to $10 million of annualized savings in fiscal 2010 from ongoing efficiency initiatives. Financing and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt In September 2009, the Company issued $400 million of 4.50% senior notes due September 15, 2014 (the 2014 Notes). Additionally, in March 2010, the Company issued $300 million of 2.85% senior notes due October 1, 2013 (the 2013 Notes). The net proceeds from both offerings were used to repay debt under the Companys Prior Credit Facility. Additionally, in March 2010, the Company signed a two year, $295 million securitization agreement replacing the previous $345 million agreement that was expiring. In October 2009, the Company redeemed in full its $150 million 2004 Notes at a premium of 103.125% of the principal amount with borrowings under the Companys Prior Credit Facility. In conjunction with the redemption of the 2004 Notes, the Company recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $6.1 million. Also during fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased $154 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 106.4%. In conjunction with the repurchase of the 2008 Notes, the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $11.8 million. As a result of the redemption of the 2004 Notes and the repurchases of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized total losses on the early debt extinguishment of $17.9 million. The losses reflected the redemption premiums as well as writing off the associated unamortized debt issuance costs. 25 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2009 Net Sales Net sales decreased 11% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 driven by a same store sales decline of 14% partially offset by incremental sales of 3% contributed by acquisitions. Gas and rent same store sales declined 10% and hardgoods same store sales declined 20%. Same store sales were driven by volume declines of 13% and a 1% price decline. Strategic products account for about 40% of revenues. In the aggregate, strategic products declined 6% on a same store sales basis in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 with growth in medical gases offset by declines in all other strategic product categories. Net Sales Year EndedMarch 31, 2010 2009 Decrease (In thousands) Distribution $ 3,478,475 $ 3,930,400 $ (451,925 ) 11 % All Other Operations 420,941 457,329 (36,388 ) 8 % Intercompany eliminations (24,263 ) (26,250 ) 1,987 $ 3,875,153 $ 4,361,479 $ (486,326 ) 11 % Distribution business segment sales decreased 11% compared to fiscal 2009 with a decline in same store sales of 12%, slightly offset by incremental sales of 1% contributed by fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 acquisitions. The Distribution business segments gas and rent same store sales declined 8% driven entirely by volumes. Hardgoods same store sales declined 20% driven by volume declines of 19% and a 1% pricing decline. Hardgoods as well as gas and rent volumes were negatively impacted by the general slowdown in economic activity and customers delaying or deferring capital projects. Sales of strategic gas products sold through the Distribution business segment declined 4%. Among strategic gas products, bulk gas sales were down 5% due to the impact of production slowdowns in the metal fabrication and steel customer segments, as well as reduced activity from oil field service customers. The decline in bulk gas sales related to these customer segments was partially offset by growth in sales of bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications. Sales of medical gases grew 2% as a result of new business signings, which were partially offset by slowing in overall demand for medical gases used in elective and non critical medical procedures. Specialty gas sales declined 9% as a result of a general softening in demand in the chemicals processing industry as well as strong sales of high value rare gases in fiscal 2009. Sales of core industrial gases, which experienced the sharpest volume declines, were down 15% for fiscal 2010, while the related rental revenues were down only 4%. However, revenues from the Companys rental welder business experienced a 21% decline in same store sales as compared to fiscal 2009. Distribution hardgoods same store sales declined 20% driven by volume declines of 19% and a 1% pricing decline. Sales of safety products decreased 9% in fiscal 2010 resulting from plant shutdowns, shift reductions and relatively high unemployment levels. The Companys Radnor&reg; private label line was down 16% for fiscal 2010 driven by the overall drop in hardgoods volumes. The All Other Operations business segment sales decreased 8% compared to fiscal 2009 with a 17% decline in same store sales offset by incremental sales of 9% contributed by acquisitions, primarily the fiscal 2009 acquisition related to the refrigerants business. The decline in same store sales reflects lower pricing for ammonia products, a decline in carbon dioxide and dry ice volumes, and reduced refrigerant volumes. After a significant run up in the costs of ammonia products in the first half of fiscal 2009, ammonia costs from suppliers suddenly dropped in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, while pricing to customers initially remained stable. Progressing through fiscal 2010, pricing to customers has been under increasing pressure contributing to the same store sales decline, while the cost of ammonia from suppliers has been rising. Reduced carbon dioxide volumes reflect weakness in the beverage carbonation customer segment. Dry ice volumes were impacted by a decline in the airline services customer segment and strong fiscal 2009 sales during the second quarter in the wake of major hurricanes. Refrigerants volume declined primarily due to mild summer weather in the eastern U.S. along with customers deferral of HVAC maintenance and conversion projects in light of the economic downturn. Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Consolidated gross profits (excluding depreciation) decreased 8% principally due to a same store sales decline offset by an expansion of gross profit margins (excluding depreciation). The consolidated gross margin (excluding depreciation) in fiscal 2010 increased 220 basis points to 55.4% compared to 53.2% in fiscal 2009 primarily driven by margin expansion in the Distribution business segment resulting from a favorable shift in sales mix. 26 Table of Contents Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Year EndedMarch 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 Decrease Distribution $ 1,948,868 $ 2,122,407 $ (173,539 ) 8 % All Other Operations 198,419 199,184 (765 ) 0 % $ 2,147,287 $ 2,321,591 $ (174,304 ) 8 % The Distribution business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) decreased 8% compared to fiscal 2009. The Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was 56.0% versus 54.0% in fiscal 2009. The 200 basis point increase in the gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) largely reflects the favorable shift in product mix toward gas and rent, which carry higher gross profit margins (excluding depreciation) than hardgoods. As a percentage of the Distribution business segments sales, gas and rent increased to 60.8% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 57.2% in fiscal 2009. The All Other Operations business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) were consistent with fiscal 2009 as a result of lower same store sales offset by acquisitions (primarily the fiscal 2009 acquisition in the refrigerants business) and margin expansion in the ammonia business. The All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) increased 350 basis points to 47.1% versus 43.6% in fiscal 2009. The year over year improvement in the All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was driven by the margin improvement in the ammonia business. The improved ammonia margin reflects the impact of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 drop in the cost of ammonia and a lag in a corresponding drop in the selling price to customers. Throughout fiscal 2010, ammonia margins declined as customer pricing fell in line with product costs. Product mix also contributed to the margin improvement. Operating Expenses SD&A expenses declined $87 million (5%) as compared to fiscal 2009 resulting from a $120 million decline in operating costs partially offset by approximately $33 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses. The $120 million decrease in operating costs reflects lower variable costs due to the decline in sales and the benefits from the Companys cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives. Also included in the fiscal 2010 SD&A expenses are $7.4 million in SAP implementation costs and $6.7 million related to withdrawals from MEPPs, which were not allocated to the business segments and are included within the other line item in the table below. Fiscal 2009 SD&A expenses included $5.8 million in SAP implementation costs and $2.0 million related to withdrawals from MEPPs. As a percentage of net sales, SD&A expense increased 230 basis points to 38.4% compared to 36.1% in fiscal 2009 reflecting the overall decline in sales and the shift in sales mix to gas and rent, which carry higher operating expenses in relation to sales and corresponding higher gross margins. SD&A Expenses Year EndedMarch 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Distribution $ 1,348,022 $ 1,441,932 $ (93,910 ) 7 % All Other Operations 127,250 126,149 1,101 1 % Other 14,033 7,847 6,186 $ 1,489,305 $ 1,575,928 $ (86,623 ) 5 % During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company incurred $23.4 million of legal and professional fees in response to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and accompanying litigation, which principally represented up front accruals for the minimum obligations to the Companys advisors. Depreciation expense of $213 million increased $15 million (7%) as compared to fiscal 2009. Acquired businesses added approximately $2 million to depreciation expense. The remaining increase primarily reflected the two new air separation units in New Carlisle, Indiana and Carrollton, Kentucky, which came on line in late fiscal 2009 and early fiscal 2010, respectively. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2010 also reflects capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand, such as cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders, and infrastructure spending on cylinder fill plants and branch locations. Amortization expense of $22 million was $1 million (2%) lower than fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower amortization of acquired customer lists and non compete agreements due to reduced acquisition activity. 27 Table of Contents Operating Income Consolidated operating income of $400 million decreased 24% in fiscal 2010 on lower sales and charges of $23.4 million related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges and costs of $7.4 million associated with the Companys SAP implementation, all of which were partially offset by gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) expansion and the benefits from the Companys cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives. In fiscal 2009, the Company recognized $2.0 million of MEPP withdrawal charges and $5.8 million in costs related to the SAP implementation. The operating income margin decreased 170 basis points to 10.3% compared to 12.0% in fiscal 2009; of the decline, 80 basis points was the result of the costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and MEPP withdrawal charges. Operating Income Year EndedMarch 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 Decrease Distribution $ 384,584 $ 477,217 $ (92,633 ) 19 % All Other Operations 52,482 55,498 (3,016 ) 5 % Other (37,468 ) (7,847 ) (29,621 ) $ 399,598 $ 524,868 $ (125,270 ) 24 % Operating income in the Distribution business segment decreased 19% in fiscal 2010. The Distribution business segments operating income margin decreased 100 basis points to 11.1% compared to 12.1% in fiscal 2009. The operating income margin decline was driven primarily by lower sales and was partially offset by favorable mix driven gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) expansion and the Companys cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives that were implemented in response to the economic downturn. Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment decreased 5% compared to fiscal 2009 mainly as a result of lower same store sales partially offset by acquisition growth (primarily the fiscal 2009 acquisition in the refrigerants business). The business segments operating income margin of 12.5% was 40 basis points higher than the operating income margin of 12.1% in fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income margin was driven principally by gross margin expansion in the ammonia business. Interest Expense, Net, and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $69 million representing a decrease of $26 million, or 28%, compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease resulted from lower weighted average interest rates related to the Companys variable rate debt instruments, the Companys redemption of higher interest rate notes, as well as lower average debt levels from the pay down during fiscal 2010 of approximately $268 million of debt and borrowings under the trade receivables securitization. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt During fiscal 2010, the Company redeemed in full the $150 million of 2004 Notes at a price of 103.125% of the principal amount. Additionally, the Company repurchased approximately $154 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 106.4%. In conjunction with these transactions, the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million. The losses related to the redemption premiums and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010 was 37.5% of pre tax earnings compared to 39.2% in fiscal 2009. The lower tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of tax benefits of $2.2 million associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. 28 Table of Contents Net Earnings Net earnings were $196 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared to $261 million, or $3.12 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2010 include costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt of $23.4 million ($14.8 million after tax) or $0.18 per diluted share, losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million ($11.3 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share and charges related to withdrawals from MEPPs of $6.7 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share, slightly offset by an income tax benefit of $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $275 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $600 million in fiscal 2010 and $583 million in fiscal 2009. The reduction in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2011 was principally driven by the new accounting treatment for the Companys Securitization Agreement, which resulted in a $295 million use of cash in operating activities and a corresponding source of cash in financing activities in the current year. On April 1, 2010, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which affected the presentation of its trade receivables securitization program. Under the new guidance, proceeds received under the securitization are treated as secured borrowings, which are classified as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, whereas previously they were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables, which were classified as an operating activity on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Furthermore, the new accounting treatment resulted in the recognition of both the trade receivables securitized under the program and the borrowings they collateralize on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet, which led to a $295 million increase in trade receivables and long term debt as of April 1, 2010. Accordingly, $295 million in new borrowings under the Securitization Agreement were classified as sources of cash under financing activities on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to April 1, 2010, these borrowings were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables and reflected net of collections on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as operating activities. Additionally, the $295 million increase in trade receivables was classified as a use of cash from operating activities. The Companys underlying business activities generated strong operating cash flows during fiscal 2011. Net earnings adjusted for non cash and non operating items provided cash of $598 million in fiscal 2011 versus $541 million in fiscal 2010 and $605 million in fiscal 2009. Adjusted cash from operations*, which essentially removes the impact of the fiscal 2011 change in accounting principle noted above and cash expenditures related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 from the Companys net cash provided by operating activities, was $617 million in the current year as compared to $648 million in the prior year. The fiscal 2011 decline in the adjusted cash from operations* reflected higher working capital requirements as a result of improving sales. Improving sales drove higher trade receivable and inventory levels as trade receivable collection rates and Days Sales Outstanding metrics improved slightly year over year, while inventory turns remained relatively consistent for both the current and prior year. Likewise, free cash flow* of $387 million in the current year decreased from $412 million in the prior year for principally the same reasons. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 totaled $262 million and primarily consisted of cash used for capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were 6.0% of sales in fiscal 2011 as compared to 6.5% of sales in fiscal 2010 and 8.1% in fiscal 2009. Capital expenditures in all three fiscal years reflected investments in revenue generating equipment, such as cylinders and bulk tanks, as well as the development of the Companys highly customized SAP system. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 also reflected the completion of major capital projects, such as the New Carlisle, Indiana air separation unit and the carbon dioxide plant in Deer Park, Texas. Capital spending in fiscal 2010 reflected the completion of the Carrollton, Kentucky air separation unit. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 are expected to remain at approximately 6.0% of sales. Cash used in investing activities decreased $61 million from fiscal 2010 and $348 million from fiscal 2009 as a result of lower capital expenditures and fewer acquisition related activities. During fiscal 2011, the Company paid $21 million to acquire eight businesses and settle holdback liabilities. The largest of the businesses acquired was Conley Gas, Ltd., a supplier of pure gases to the specialty gas industry, with historical annual sales of approximately $9 million. In fiscal 2010, the Company made acquisition related cash payments of $81 million primarily associated with the purchase of six businesses, the largest of which was Tri Tech, a Florida based industrial gas and welding supply distributor with approximately $31 million in historical annual sales. During fiscal 2009, the Company paid $274 million to acquire 14 businesses, the largest of which was Refron, Inc., a distributor of refrigerant gases with historical annual sales of $93 million, and to settle acquisition holdback liabilities. 29 Table of Contents Financing activities used cash of $3 million in fiscal 2011 and $278 million in fiscal 2010. Financing activities provided cash of $31 million in fiscal 2009. As noted in the Financial Instruments section below, during fiscal 2011, the Company engaged in refinancing activities, which extended its average debt maturity to 3.6 years at March 31, 2011. In addition to refinancing its Prior Credit Facility, the Company also issued $250 million of 3.25% senior notes during fiscal 2011. The Company also authorized and completed a share repurchase plan in its fiscal fourth quarter, purchasing 4.8 million shares of treasury stock for $300 million. The treasury stock purchases were financed under the Credit Facility. The change in accounting principle for the Securitization Agreement noted above was reflected in proceeds from borrowings, but had no impact on the Companys net cash position. Absent the change in accounting principle, the Company borrowed a net $36 million during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, the Company redeemed in full its $150 million 6.25% senior notes and purchased a significant portion of its 7.125% senior subordinated notes. Also in fiscal 2010, the Company issued $400 million of 4.5% senior notes and $300 million of 2.85% senior notes, using the net proceeds from both offerings to pay down its Prior Credit Facility. The Company repaid a net $254 million of debt during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009, the Company issued $400 million of 7.125% senior subordinated notes using the proceeds to pay down its Prior Credit Facility. The Company also purchased 2.4 million treasury shares for $120 million and completed a share repurchase plan in fiscal 2009. The Company also increased its per share dividend payouts to stockholders by 33% in fiscal 2011 and by 36% in fiscal 2010. Dividends The Company paid its stockholders quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share at the end of the first quarter and $0.25 per share at end of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company paid dividends of $0.29 per share. On May 17, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share, which is payable on June 30, 2011 to the stockholders of record as of June 15, 2011. During fiscal 2010, the Company paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share at the end of each of the first three quarters and $0.22 in the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2009, the Company paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per share at the end of each of the first two quarters and $0.16 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Instruments Senior Subordinated Note Redemption During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased $30 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 110.6%. Losses on the early extinguishment of the 2018 Notes were $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2011 and related to the redemption premiums and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased $155 million of its 2018 Notes and redeemed in full the $150 million of 2004 Notes. The Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million in fiscal 2010. The losses related to the redemption premiums and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Senior Credit Facility On September 13, 2010, the Company entered into its new four year $750 million Credit Facility. The Credit Facility consists of a $650 million U.S. dollar revolving credit line and a $100 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) multi currency revolving credit line. The maturity date of the revolving credit lines is September 13, 2014. Under circumstances described in the Credit Facility, the revolving credit line may be increased by an additional $325 million, provided that the multi currency revolving credit line may not be increased by more than an additional $50 million. In connection with the entry by the Company into the Credit Facility, on September 13, 2010, the Company terminated its Prior Credit Facility, a senior credit facility with an aggregate commitment of $1.7 billion. All obligations under the Prior Credit Facility (including the term loans) were repaid in full using proceeds of the Credit Facility and other funds. As a result of the termination of the Prior Credit Facility, the Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2011 related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of March 31, 2011, the Company had $374 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility, including $331 million under the U.S. dollar revolver and $43 million under the multi currency revolver. The Company also had outstanding letters of credit of $41 million issued under the Credit Facility. The U.S. dollar revolver borrowings bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 212.5 basis points. The multi currency revolver bears interest based on a spread of 212.5 basis points over the Euro currency rate applicable to each foreign currency borrowing. As of March 31, 2011, the average effective interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolver and the multi currency revolver were 2.31% and 2.87%, respectively. 30 Table of Contents The Company also maintains a committed revolving line of credit of up to 5.0 million (U.S. $7.1 million) to fund its expansion into France. These revolving credit borrowings are outside of the Companys Credit Facility. At March 31, 2011, French revolving credit borrowings were 2.9 million (U.S. $4.1 million). The variable interest rates on the French revolving credit borrowings are based on the Euro currency rate plus 212.5 basis points. As of March 31, 2011, the effective interest rate on the French revolving credit borrowings was 2.98%. The French revolving line of credit was amended in February 2011 to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2011 and increase the borrowing capacity. At March 31, 2011, the Credit Facilitys financial covenant did not restrict the Companys ability to borrow on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment and breach of covenants. In the event of default, repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility may be accelerated. The Companys Credit Facility also contains cross default provisions whereby a default under the Credit Facility could result in defaults under the senior and senior subordinated notes discussed below. Total Borrowing Capacity As of March 31, 2011, $335 million remained unused under the Companys Credit Facility. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity from cash from operations and under its revolving credit facilities to meet its working capital, capital expenditure and other financial commitments. The financial covenant under the Companys Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.5. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting debt and, historically, the amounts outstanding under the Securitization Agreement divided by a contractually defined Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for the trailing twelve month period with pro forma adjustments for acquisitions. The financial covenant calculations of the Credit Facility include the pro forma results of acquired businesses. Therefore, total borrowing capacity is not reduced dollar for dollar with acquisition financing. The leverage ratio measures the Companys ability to meet current and future obligations. At March 31, 2011, the Companys leverage ratio was 2.4. The Company continually evaluates alternative financing and believes that it can obtain financing on reasonable terms. The terms of any future financing arrangements depend on market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time. Money Market Loans The Company has an agreement with a financial institution that provides access to short term advances not to exceed $35 million. The agreement expires on December 1, 2011, but may be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The advances are generally overnight or for up to seven days. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March 31, 2011, there were no advances outstanding under the agreement. The Company also has an agreement with another financial institution that provides access to additional short term advances not to exceed $35 million. The advances may be for one to six months with rates at a fixed spread over the corresponding LIBOR. At March 31, 2011, there were no advances outstanding under the agreement. Senior Notes On September 30, 2010, the Company issued $250 million of 3.25% senior notes due October 1, 2015 (the 2015 Notes). The 2015 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 3.283%. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2015 Notes were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit line under the Credit Facility. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2015 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make whole payments. At March 31, 2011, the Company had $400 million outstanding of the 2014 Notes. The 2014 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 4.527%. Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2014 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make whole payments. At March 31, 2011, the Company had $300 million outstanding of the 2013 Notes. The 2013 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 2.871%. Interest on the 2013 Notes is payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2013 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make whole payments. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the incurrence of liens and limit sale and leaseback transactions. 31 Table of Contents Senior Subordinated Notes At March 31, 2011, the Company had $215 million of its 2018 Notes outstanding. The 2018 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 7.125%, payable semi annually on October 1 and April 1 of each year. The 2018 Notes have a redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2018 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is October 1, 2013 at a price of 103.563% of the principal amount. During the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company incurred a one time interest penalty payable to holders of the 2018 Notes in the amount of $2.6 million related to the late removal of the restrictive legend on these notes. The Company has classified these charges as interest expense. The 2018 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long term debt also includes acquisition and other notes, principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired, which are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2011, acquisition and other notes totaled $9.9 million with an average interest rate of approximately 6% and an average maturity of approximately one year. Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in the Securitization Agreement with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis. Effective April 1, 2010 under new accounting guidance, the Companys sale of qualified trade receivable is now accounted for as a secured borrowing under which qualified trade receivables collateralize amounts borrowed from the commercial banks. Trade receivables that collateralize the Securitization Agreement are held in a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Qualified trade receivables in the amount of the outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement are not available to the general creditors of the Company. The maximum amount of the Securitization Agreement is $295 million and it bears interest at approximately LIBOR plus 80 basis points. At March 31, 2011, the amount of outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement has been classified as long term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts borrowed under the Securitization Agreement could fluctuate monthly based on the Companys funding requirements and the level of qualified trade receivables available to collateralize the Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreement expires in March 2013 and contains customary events of termination, including standard cross default provisions with respect to outstanding debt. The amount of outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement at March 31, 2011 was $295 million. Interest Rate Derivatives The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The Companys involvement with derivative instruments is limited to a) highly effective interest rate swap agreements used to manage well defined interest rate risk exposures and b) treasury rate lock agreements used to fix the interest rate related to forecasted debt issuances. The Company monitors its positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties. Interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements are not entered into for trading purposes. The Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At March 31, 2011, the Company was party to a total of five interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million. The Company designates fixed interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges of interest payments on variable rate debt associated with the Companys Securitization Agreement. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings. During fiscal 2011, fixed interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million matured and at March 31, 2011, the Company was not party to any fixed interest rate swap agreements. 32 Table of Contents For the year ended March 31, 2011, the fair value of the liability for the fixed interest rate swap agreements decreased and the Company recorded a corresponding adjustment to AOCI of $4.0 million, or $2.7 million after tax. For the year ended March 31, 2010, the fair value of the liability for the fixed interest rate swap agreements decreased and the Company recorded a corresponding adjustment to AOCI of $8.6 million, or $5.6 million after tax. The amount of gain or loss recorded in earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated cash flow hedges was immaterial for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. In anticipation of the issuance of the 2015 Notes, the Company entered into a treasury rate lock agreement in July 2010, with a notional amount of $100 million, maturing on September 8, 2010. The treasury rate lock agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge of the semi annual interest payments associated with the forecasted issuance of the 2015 Notes. When the treasury rate lock agreement matured, the Company incurred a loss of $2.6 million ($1.6 million after tax) which is reported as a component of AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings over the term of the 2015 Notes. For the year ended March 31, 2011, $258 thousand of the loss on the treasury rate lock was reclassified to interest expense. At March 31, 2011, the estimated loss recorded in AOCI on the treasury rate lock agreement that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $326 thousand, net of tax. The Company also has variable interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. At March 31, 2011, the Company had five variable interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional amount of $300 million. These variable interest rate swaps effectively convert the Companys $300 million of fixed rate 2013 Notes to variable rate debt. At March 31, 2011, these swap agreements required the Company to make variable interest payments based on a weighted average forward rate of 2.17% and receive fixed interest payments from the counterparties based on a fixed rate of 2.85%. The maturity of these fair value swaps coincides with the maturity date of the Companys 2013 Notes in October 2013. During the year ended March 31, 2011, the fair value of the variable interest rate swaps increased by $5.7 million to an asset of $5.1 million and was recorded in other non current assets. The corresponding increase in the carrying value of the 2013 Notes caused by the hedged risk was $5.6 million and was recorded in long term debt. The Company records the gain or loss on the hedged item (i.e., the 2013 Notes) and the gain or loss on the variable interest rate swaps in interest expense. The net gain or loss recorded in earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated fair value hedges was immaterial for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company measures the fair value of its interest rate swaps using observable market rates to calculate the forward yield curves used to determine expected cash flows for each interest rate swap agreement. The discounted present values of the expected cash flows are calculated using the same forward yield curve. The discount rate assumed in the fair value calculations is adjusted for non performance risk, dependent on the classification of the interest rate swap as an asset or liability. If an interest rate swap is a liability, the Company assesses the credit and non performance risk of Airgas by determining an appropriate credit spread for entities with similar credit characteristics as the Company. If, however, an interest rate swap is in an asset position, a credit analysis of counterparties is performed assessing the credit and non performance risk based upon the pricing history of counterparty specific credit default swaps or credit spreads for entities with similar credit ratings to the counterparties. The Company does not believe it is at risk for non performance by its counterparties. However, if an interest rate swap is in an asset position, the failure of one or more of its counterparties would result in an increase in interest expense and a reduction of earnings. The Company compares its fair value calculations to the fair values calculated by the counterparties for each swap agreement for reasonableness. OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets, business insurance reserves and deferred income tax assets. Uncertainties about future events make these estimates susceptible to change. Management evaluates these estimates regularly and believes they are the best estimates, appropriately made, given the known facts and circumstances. For the three years ended March 31, 2011, there were no material changes in the valuation methods or assumptions used by management. However, actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are critical due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for these matters, their susceptibility to change and the potential impact that different assumptions could have on operating performance. 33 Table of Contents Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes sales returns, sales allowances and bad debts. The allowance adjusts the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on estimates of accounts that will not ultimately be collected. An allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established as trade receivables age beyond their due dates. As past due balances age, higher valuation allowances are established lowering the net carrying value of receivables. The amount of valuation allowance established for each past due period reflects the Companys historical collections experience and current economic conditions and trends. The Company also establishes valuation allowances for specific problem accounts and bankruptcies. The amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions, the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions, the financial condition of individual customers, and the terms of reorganization for accounts emerging from bankruptcy. Changes in these conditions impact the Companys collection experience and may result in the recognition of higher or lower valuation allowances. Management evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Historically, bad debt expense reflected in the Companys financial results has generally been in the range of 0.3% to 0.5% of sales. The Company has a low concentration of credit risk due to its broad and diversified customer base across multiple industries and geographic locations, and its relatively low average order size. The Companys largest customer accounts for approximately 0.5% of total net sales. Inventories The Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of the products the Company carries in inventory have long shelf lives and are not subject to technological obsolescence. The Company writes its inventory down to its estimated market value when it believes the market value is below cost. The Company estimates its ability to recover the costs of items in inventory by product type based on its age, the rate at which that product line is turning in inventory, its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The ability of the Company to recover its cost for products in inventory can be affected by factors such as future customer demand, general market conditions and the relationship with significant suppliers. Management evaluates the recoverability of its inventory at least quarterly. In aggregate, inventory turns four to five times per year. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that they may be impaired. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October 31 of each year. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process. The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of its reporting units. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margins, future capital expenditures, working capital needs, discount rates, perpetual growth rates, etc. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated potential impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in step one, is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is not permitted. The discount rate, sales growth and profitability assumptions and perpetual growth rate are the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing industry with an equity size premium added, as applicable, for each reporting unit. The WACC is calculated based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt) are based on market data at a point in time. Other data (such as beta and the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time. 34 Table of Contents The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. The Companys analysis uses internally generated budgets and long range forecasts. The Companys discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in these budgets and forecasts about sales trends, inflation, working capital needs and forecasted capital expenditures along with an estimate of the reporting units terminal value (the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period) to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys assumptions about working capital needs and capital expenditures are based on historical experience. The perpetual growth rate assumed in the discounted cash flow model was in line with the long term growth rate as measured by the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and the industrys long term rate of growth. The Company believes the assumptions used in its discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, the Company may not meet its sales growth and profitability targets, working capital needs and capital expenditures may be higher than forecast, changes in credit markets may result in changes to the Companys discount rate and general business conditions may result in changes to the Companys terminal value assumptions for its reporting units. The Companys October 31, 2010 annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial amount. Furthermore, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the fair value of each reporting unit would not indicate that goodwill associated with any reporting unit was potentially impaired. Business Insurance Reserves The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, these programs had high deductible limits of $1 million per occurrence. For fiscal 2012, the high deductible limits will remain $1 million per occurrence. The Company reserves for its self insured retention based on individual claim evaluations establishing loss estimates for known claims based on the current facts and circumstances. These known claims are then developed through actuarial computations, to reflect the expected ultimate loss for the known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Actuarial computations use the Companys specific loss history, payment patterns and insurance coverage, plus industry trends and other factors to estimate the required reserve for all open claims by policy year and loss type. Reserves for the Companys self insurance retention are evaluated monthly. Semi annually, the Company obtains a third party actuarial report to validate that the computations and assumptions used are consistent with actuarial standards. Certain assumptions used in the actuarial computations are susceptible to change. Loss development factors are influenced by items such as medical inflation, changes in workers compensation laws, and changes in the Companys loss payment patterns, all of which can have a significant influence on the estimated ultimate loss related to the Companys self insured retention. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of open claims may be for amounts more or less than the reserve balances. The Companys operations are spread across a significant number of locations, which helps to mitigate the potential impact of any given event that could give rise to an insurance related loss. Over the last three years, business insurance expense has generally been in the range of 0.6% to 0.8% of sales. Income Taxes At March 31, 2011, the Company had deferred tax assets of $109.2 million (net of valuation allowances of $9.4 million), deferred tax liabilities of $782.0 million and a net $9.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the Company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred income tax assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforward deferred tax assets become deductible or utilized. Management considers the reversal of taxable temporary differences and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets reverse, at March 31, 2011 management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances. Unrecognized tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns that have not been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Companys tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the Companys tax positions. The Companys practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. The Company does not anticipate significant changes in the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits over the next year. 35 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table presents the Companys contractual obligations as of March 31, 2011: (In thousands) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations: Total Less than 1Year (a) 1 to 3 Years (a) 3 to 5 Years (a) More than 5Years (a) Long term debt (1) $ 1,848,519 $ 9,868 $ 598,447 $ 1,024,684 $ 215,520 Estimated interest payments on long term debt (2) 273,653 62,609 117,138 55,529 38,377 Estimated receipts on interest rate swap agreements (3) (5,086 ) (5,086 ) Non compete agreements (4) 17,507 4,717 7,700 4,674 416 Letters of credit (5) 40,859 40,859 Operating leases (6) 268,656 82,363 109,646 51,154 25,493 Purchase obligations: Liquid bulk gas supply agreements (7) 675,192 116,420 217,155 194,552 147,065 Liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements (8) 184,504 18,975 31,540 26,307 107,682 Ammonia supply commitments (9) 4,265 3,121 1,144 Other purchase commitments (10) 1,449 1,449 Construction commitments (11) 28,935 25,253 3,682 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,338,453 $ 365,634 $ 1,081,366 $ 1,356,900 $ 534,553 (a) The Less than 1 Year column relates to obligations due in fiscal 2012. The 1 to 3 Years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ending March 31, 2013 and 2014. The 3 to 5 Years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ending March 31, 2015 and 2016. The More than 5 Years column relates to obligations due in fiscal years ending March 31, 2017 and beyond. (1) Aggregate long term debt instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2011. Long term debt includes capital lease obligations, which were not material and, therefore, did not warrant separate disclosure. (2) The future interest payments on the Companys long term debt obligations were estimated based on the current outstanding principal reduced by scheduled maturities in each period presented and interest rates as of March 31, 2011. The actual interest payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of long term debt outstanding and actual interest rates in future periods. (3) Receipts under interest rate swap agreements result from changes in market interest rates compared to contractual rates and payments to be exchanged between the parties to the agreements. The estimated receipts in future periods were determined based on forward LIBOR rates as of March 31, 2011. Actual receipts may differ materially from those presented above based on actual interest rates in future periods. (4) Non compete agreements are obligations of the Company to make scheduled future payments, generally to former owners of acquired businesses, contingent upon their compliance with the covenants of the non compete agreement. (5) Letters of credit are guarantees of payment to third parties. The Companys letters of credit principally back obligations associated with the Companys self insured retention on workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. The letters of credit are supported by the Companys Credit Facility. (6) The Companys operating leases at March 31, 2011 include approximately $183 million in fleet vehicles under long term operating leases. The Company guarantees a residual value of $27 million related to its leased vehicles. (7) In addition to the gas volumes supplied by Airgas Merchant Gases, the Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases. The Company has a long term take or pay supply agreement, in effect through August 31, 2017, with Air Products to supply the Company with bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon. Additionally, the Company purchases helium gas from Air Products under long term supply agreements. Based on the volume of fiscal 2011 purchases, the Air Products supply agreements represent approximately $53 million annually in liquid bulk gas purchases. The Company also has long term take or pay supply agreements with Linde AG to purchase oxygen, nitrogen, argon and, helium. The agreements expire at various dates through July 2019 and represent approximately $49 million in annual bulk gas purchases. Additionally, the Company has long term take or pay supply agreements to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon from other major producers. Annual purchases under these contracts are approximately $14 million and they expire at various dates through June 2024. 36 Table of Contents The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2011 purchases. The supply agreements noted above contain periodic adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analysis. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. (8) The Company is a party to long term take or pay supply agreements for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide with approximately 15 suppliers that expire at various dates through 2044. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2011 purchases. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the carbon dioxide supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. Certain of the liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements contain market pricing subject to certain economic indices. (9) The Company purchases ammonia from a variety of sources and is obligated to purchase approximately $3.1 million annually under these contracts. (10) Other purchase commitments primarily include property, plant and equipment expenditures. (11) Construction commitments represent an outstanding commitment to a customer to construct an on site air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee. Reconciliations of Non GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) * Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Cash from Operations Reconciliations and computations of free cash flow and adjusted cash from operations: Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 (Amounts in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 275,301 $ 600,047 Adjustments to cash provided by operating activities: Cash used by the securitization of trade receivables 295,000 16,400 Stock issued for employee stock purchase plan 14,997 15,428 Tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options 8,444 15,444 Cash expenditures related to unsolicited takeover attempt 23,427 963 Adjusted cash from operations 617,169 648,282 Capital expenditures (256,030 ) (252,828 ) Adjustments to capital expenditures: Proceeds from sales of plant and equipment 15,844 14,466 Operating lease buyouts 9,893 1,687 Adjusted capital expenditures (230,293 ) (236,675 ) Free cash flow $ 386,876 $ 411,607 The Company believes that free cash flow and adjusted cash from operations provide investors meaningful insight into the Companys ability to generate cash from operations, which is available for servicing debt obligations and for the execution of its business strategies, including acquisitions, the prepayment of debt, the payment of dividends, or to support other investing and financing activities. Non GAAP numbers should be read in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, as non GAAP metrics are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our free cash flow and adjusted cash from operations metrics may be different from free cash flow and adjusted cash from operations metrics provided by other companies. 37 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009 13), which addresses the allocation of revenue in arrangements containing multiple deliverables. Specifically, ASU 2009 13 modifies existing GAAP by providing new guidance concerning (1) the determination of whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting, and (2) the manner in which arrangement consideration should be allocated to such deliverables. The guidance requires the use of an entitys best estimate of the selling price of a deliverable if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling price cannot be determined. Additionally, ASU 2009 13 eliminates the use of the residual method of allocating consideration when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling price is known for some, but not all, of the delivered items in a multiple element arrangement. Finally, ASU 2009 13 requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures in the financial statements. ASU 2009 13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements, or it may be applied retrospectively. The Company currently has contracts in place that contain multiple deliverables, principally product supply agreements for gases and container rental. The Company treats the deliverables in these arrangements under current GAAP as separate units of accounting with selling prices derived from Company specific or third party evidence. The Company adopted the new guidance, prospectively, on April 1, 2011. The new guidance is not expected to significantly modify the accounting for these types of arrangements. In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 28, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2010 28), which provides additional guidance on when Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The guidance clarifies that for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts, Step 2 must be performed if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists based on the evaluation of certain qualitative factors. ASU 2010 28 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2010, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted the new guidance on April 1, 2011 with no impact on its consolidated financial statements. Future goodwill impairment tests will follow the requirements of the new guidance. In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 29, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2010 29), which provides clarification on disclosure requirements and amends current guidance to require entities to disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the current year had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. Qualitative disclosures describing the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combinations included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings are also required. ASU 2010 29 is effective for business combinations with acquisition dates on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2010 29 on April 1, 2011. Pro forma disclosures for future acquisitions will follow the new guidance.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Companys borrowing agreements. Interest rate derivatives are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company also uses treasury rate lock agreements to hedge the risk associated with the interest rates paid on forecasted debt issuances. The Company has not established, and will not establish, any interest rate risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources or anticipated funding sources. The counterparties to interest rate derivatives are major financial institutions. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long term credit ratings of at least a single A rating by one of the major credit rating agencies. In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non performance by the counterparties. The table below summarizes the Companys market risks associated with debt obligations, interest rate swaps and the trade receivables securitization at March 31, 2011. For debt obligations and the trade receivables securitization, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate swaps, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period. 39 Table of Contents Fiscal Year of Maturity 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Value (In millions) Fixed Rate Debt: Acquisition notes and other $ 5.8 $ 2.9 $ 0.5 $ 0.5 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 9.9 $ 10.1 Interest expense 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.7 Average interest rate 6.15 % 6.14 % 5.95 % 4.62 % 3.85 % 2.06 % Senior notes due 10/1/2013 $ $ $ 300.0 $ $ $ $ 300.0 $ 308.7 Interest expense 8.6 8.6 4.2 21.4 Interest rate 2.85 % 2.85 % 2.85 % 0 % 0 % 0 % Senior notes due 9/15/2014 $ $ $ $ 400.0 $ $ $ 400.0 $ 419.9 Interest expense 18.0 18.0 18.0 8.3 62.3 Interest rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % 0 % 0 % Senior notes due 10/1/2015 $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 $ $ 250.0 $ 249.4 Interest expense 8.1 8.1 8.1 8.1 4.2 36.6 Interest rate 3.25 % 3.25 % 3.25 % 3.25 % 3.25 % 0 % Senior subordinated notes due 10/1/2018 $ $ $ $ $ $ 215.4 $ 215.4 $ 235.1 Interest expense 15.4 15.4 15.4 15.4 15.4 38.1 115.1 Interest rate 7.13 % 7.13 % 7.13 % 7.13 % 7.13 % 7.13 % Variable Rate Debt: Revolving credit borrowings US $ $ $ $ 331.0 $ $ $ 331.0 $ 333.6 Interest expense 7.8 7.7 7.7 3.6 26.8 Interest rate (a) 2.31 % 2.31 % 2.31 % 2.31 % 0 % 0 % Revolving credit borrowings Multi currency $ $ $ $ 43.1 $ $ $ 43.1 $ 43.4 Interest expense 1.3 1.3 1.3 0.4 4.3 Interest rate (a) 2.87 % 2.87 % 2.87 % 2.87 % 0 % 0 % Revolving credit borrowings France $ 4.1 $ $ $ $ $ $ 4.1 $ 4.1 Interest expense 0.1 0.1 Interest rate (a) 2.98 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % Trade receivables securitization $ $ 295.0 $ $ $ $ $ 295.0 $ 295.0 Interest expense 3.1 3.1 6.2 Interest rate 1.06 % 1.06 % Interest Rate Swaps: 5 swaps receive fixed/pay variable Notional amounts $ $ $ 300.0 $ $ $ $ 300.0 $ (5.1 ) Swap (receipts) (5.1 ) (5.1 ) Variable forward pay rate 2.17% Weighted average receive rate 2.85% (a) The interest rate on the revolving credit facilities is the weighted average of the variable interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolving credit line and the multi currency revolving credit line. The variable interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolving credit line are based on a spread over LIBOR applicable to each tranche under the U.S. credit line. The average of the variable interest rates on the multi currency portions of the Credit Facility is based on a spread over the Euro currency rate applicable to each foreign currency borrowing under the multi currency credit line. The variable interest rates on the French revolving credit borrowings are also based on a spread over the Euro currency rate. Limitations of the Tabular Presentation As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March 31, 2011, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Companys credit rating. 40 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Rate Risk Canadian subsidiaries and the European operations of the Company are funded with local currency debt. The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its financial position and results of operations.
