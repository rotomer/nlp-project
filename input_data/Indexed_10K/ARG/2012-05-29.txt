ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2012 COMPARED TO 2011OVERVIEWAirgas had net sales for the year ended March 31, 2012 (fiscal 2012 or current year) of $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2011 (fiscal 2011 or prior year), an increase of 12%. Total same store sales increased 10%, with hardgoods up 14% and gas and rent up 7%. Acquisitions contributed 2% sales growth in the current year. The same store sales growth for the current year was driven by both volume and price, with sales volumes up 6% and pricing up 4%. The increase in sales volumes reflects strength in the Companys manufacturing, petrochemical and energy customers, with relative outperformance in the hardgoods business on the strength of welding and automation equipment sales. Higher pricing reflects a broad based price increase on gas and rent effective March 1, 2011 and, to a lesser extent, an additional price increase on gas and rent effective December 1, 2011. The pricing actions were designed to offset rising product, operating and distribution costs as well as support ongoing investments in production and distribution capabilities to support and efficiently meet the growing demands of the Companys customers.The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in the current year was 54.2%, a decline of 80 basis points from the prior year, reflecting continued outperformance of hardgoods sales, a mix shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment, and an increase in sales to large customers that generally carry lower gross profit margins (excluding depreciation) and a lower net cost to serve.The Companys operating income margin increased to 11.7%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year. Additionally, the current and prior years operating income margins were burdened by 50 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, of net special charges. The current year also included a 70 basis point negative impact from SAP (see Enterprise Information System section below) implementation costs and depreciation expense compared to only 40 basis points of such SAP costs in the prior year.Net earnings per diluted share rose to $4.00 in the current year versus $2.94 in the prior year. Net earnings per diluted share in the current year reflect the benefit of the Companys two recently completed share repurchase programs, which offset $0.20 per diluted share of incremental SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. Net earnings per diluted share in the current and prior years included net special charges of $0.11 and $0.41 per diluted share, respectively. Net special charges in each year consisted of the following: Years Ended March 31,Effect on Diluted EPS2012 2011Restructuring and other special charges$0.19 $Costs (benefits) related to unsolicited takeover attempt(0.06) 0.33Multi employer pension plan withdrawal charges0.04 0.03Losses on the extinguishment of debt 0.03One time interest penalty 0.02Income tax benefits(0.06) Special charges, net$0.11 $0.41Enterprise Information SystemThe Company continued its phased, multi year rollout of its highly customized SAP enterprise information system during the current year. At this stage in the Companys phased implementation, each of its four BSCs, into which the regional company accounting and administrative functions will be consolidated upon converting to SAP, are firmly in place. Through March 31, 2012, the Company has successfully converted its Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure businesses and five regional distribution companies to the SAP platform. Two additional regional distribution company conversions are scheduled for the first quarter of the year ending March 31, 2013 (fiscal 2013). The Company expects to have eleven of its twelve regional distribution companies converted to SAP by the end of calendar year 2012. The remaining regional company will be converted in the first quarter of calendar 2013. 18Table of ContentsWith more than half of the Companys business operating on SAP, the Company believes the implementation risk associated with the remaining business units has been significantly diminished and is beginning to focus more on attaining benefits. The Company incurred the highest level of expenses related to the SAP implementation in fiscal 2012, as the first five of the regional distribution companies, including all four BSCs, were converted during this period. Total implementation costs and depreciation expense related to the SAP system were $0.34 and $0.14 per diluted share for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and such costs, net of expected benefits, are estimated to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.16 per diluted share for the year ending March 31, 2013. The Company expects the combination of lower implementation costs and the increase in SAP related benefits to yield year over year earnings accretion of between $0.18 and $0.22 per diluted share in fiscal 2013 above and beyond the Companys base business performance.The Company previously quantified the economic benefits expected to be achieved through its implementation of SAP in three key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management, and administrative and operating efficiencies. By December 2013, the Company expects these areas alone to have yielded a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income benefits. Further economic benefits are expected to be identified as the implementation progresses.New Divisional Alignment and LLC FormationIn May 2011, the Company announced the alignment of its twelve regional distribution companies into four new divisions, and the consolidation of its regional company accounting and certain administrative functions into four newly created BSCs. Additionally, the Company initiated a related change in its legal entity structure on January 1, 2012 whereby the majority of Airgas distribution businesses have merged or will merge into a single limited liability company (LLC) of which the Company is the sole member. Each of the Companys twelve regional distribution companies operated (prior to conversion to SAP) or operates its own accounting and administrative functions. Enabled by the Companys conversion to a single information platform across all of its regional companies as part of the SAP implementation, the restructuring will allow Airgas to more effectively utilize its resources across regional company boundaries and form an operating structure that will help Airgas leverage the full benefits of its new SAP platform.During the current year, the Company recorded restructuring and other related costs of $20.2 million associated with the Companys organization and legal entity changes. Of this amount, total restructuring costs of $14.5 million were recorded in the current year, primarily consisting of a $13.3 million restructuring charge for severance benefits. The Company also incurred $5.7 million of other costs related to the divisional realignment and LLC formation, primarily related to transition staffing for the BSCs, legal costs and other expenses. The realignment is expected to be completed in fiscal 2013, during which year the Company expects to incur additional costs, primarily related to transition staffing, legal, relocation and other costs, of approximately $8 million. AcquisitionsDuring the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company purchased eight businesses with aggregate historical annual sales of approximately $106 million. The largest of these businesses were ABCO, Pain and Nordan Smith. ABCO was a New England based industrial gas and welding supply distributor with 12 locations throughout Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island with historical annual sales of approximately $35 million. Pain, a producer and distributor of dry ice and liquid carbon dioxide with 20 locations throughout the Midwestern United States, generated historical annual sales of approximately $33 million. Nordan Smith was a Mississippi based industrial gas and welding supply distributor with 17 locations throughout Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama with historical annual sales of approximately $31 million. Stock Repurchase ProgramsDuring the three months ended June 30, 2011, the Company completed a $300 million share repurchase program announced on May 5, 2011, repurchasing 4.46 million shares on the open market at an average price of $67.19. During the fourth quarter of the prior year, the Company also completed a $300 million share repurchase program by repurchasing 4.78 million of its shares on the open market at an average price of $62.76.Supply ConstraintsThe industrial gas industry is working through supply constraints related to helium. Factors and events driving the helium shortage include a reduction in the amount of helium made available by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management from the Federal Helium Reserve (a major source of helium in North America), and shortfalls of helium from global sources accelerated by recent disruptions in crude helium production and limited liquefied natural gas demand and production. The Companys major helium suppliers have decreased their helium allocations to the Company. The Company is contesting the appropriateness of these allocations and is working to secure additional helium sources in order to meet customer demand. To help mitigate the 19Table of Contentsfinancial impact to Airgas, the Company has instituted product allocations and price increases related to helium. Sales of helium represent approximately 3% of the Companys consolidated net sales. Fiscal 2013 OutlookThe Company expects earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2013 in the range of $4.64 to $4.79. The earnings per diluted share range for fiscal 2013 includes an estimated $0.06 per diluted share of restructuring charges and related costs arising from the Companys transition to BSCs and $0.12 to $0.16 per diluted share of implementation costs and depreciation expense, net of expected benefits, associated with the Companys SAP implementation. The Company estimates same store sales growth for fiscal 2013 in the mid to upper single digits based on a continuation of recent business trends and continued modest expansion in U.S. industrial production activity.20Table of ContentsSTATEMENT OF EARNINGS COMMENTARY FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2011Results for the prior years were adjusted for the retrospective application of a change implemented in the current year in the Companys method of accounting for the small portion of its hardgoods inventory valued using the last in, first out (LIFO) to the average cost method. The impact of this change was immaterial to the operating results for all periods presented. Business segment information and statement of earnings commentary related to the prior years have been recast to reflect the change in accounting principle.Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports expenses (excluding depreciation) related to the implementation of its SAP system under selling, distribution and administrative expenses as other expenses that are not allocated to the Companys business segments. Costs associated with the Companys withdrawal from various multi employer pension plans (MEPPs) are also reported under selling, distribution and administrative expenses in the Other line item in the tables below. Additionally, the Companys restructuring and other special charges and the legal, professional and other costs incurred as a result of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.s (Air Products) unsolicited takeover attempt are not allocated to the Companys business segments. These costs are also reflected in the Other line item in the tables below.Net SalesNet sales increased 12% to $4.7 billion for the current year compared to the prior year, driven by same store sales growth of 10% and incremental sales of 2% contributed by acquisitions. Gas and rent same store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 14%. Same store sales were driven by increased volumes of 6% and price of 4%. The Company estimates same store sales growth based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. Strategic products account for approximately 40% of net sales and include safety products, bulk, medical and specialty gases, as well as carbon dioxide and dry ice. The Company has identified these products as strategic because it believes they have good long term growth profiles relative to the Companys core industrial gas and welding products due to favorable end customer markets, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross selling opportunities or a combination thereof. For the current year, sales of strategic products increased 8% on a same store sales basis as compared to the prior year. Strategic accounts also contributed to the increase in net sales for the year. Strategic accounts sales growth of 12% was primarily driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in the Companys existing metal fabrication, oil and gas and chemical customer bases. The strategic accounts program, which now represents more than 20% of net sales, was designed to deliver superior product and service offerings to larger, multi location customers, and presents the Company with strong cross selling opportunities.The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from the All Other Operations business segment to the Distribution business segment. Years Ended Net Sales(In thousands)March 31, 2012 2011 Increase Distribution$4,234,869 $3,810,136 $424,733 11%All Other Operations549,213 472,054 77,159 16%Intercompany eliminations(37,799) (30,723) (7,076) $4,746,283 $4,251,467 $494,816 12%The Distribution business segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases, and process chemicals; cylinder and equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, construction supplies and maintenance, repair and operating supplies.21Table of ContentsDistribution business segment sales increased 11% compared to the prior year with an increase in same store sales of 10% and incremental sales of 1% contributed by current and prior year acquisitions. Same store sales growth for the Distribution business segment was driven by increased volumes of 6% and price of 4%. The Distribution business segments gas and rent same store sales increased 7%, with volumes up 3% and pricing up 4%. Hardgoods same store sales increased 14%, with volumes up 10% and pricing up 4%. Both gas and rent and hardgoods volumes reflect the strength in the Companys manufacturing, petrochemical and energy customers, while the increase in pricing was primarily driven by the March 1, 2011 and, to a lesser extent, December 1, 2011 price increases.Sales of strategic gas products sold through the Distribution business segment in the current year increased 6% from the prior year. Among strategic gas products, bulk gas sales were up 7% on improvement in the industrial manufacturing customer base and new customer signings. Sales of medical gases were up 5% as a result of new business signings and stronger demand across most medical segments. Sales of specialty gases were up 5% driven primarily by higher volumes on improvement in demand for core specialty gases, including EPA protocols.Contributing to the rise in Distribution business segment hardgoods same store sales were increases in both safety products and the Companys Radnor private label brand product line, as well as strong growth in welding and automation equipment. Safety product sales increased 16% in the current year, comparing favorably to the hardgoods same store sales increase for the Distribution business segment of 14% and reflecting broad based improvement in the core safety business, particularly in large industrial production and strategic account customers. The Companys Radnor private label line was up 15% for the current year, driven by the overall increase in hardgoods volumes.Revenues from the Companys rental welder business experienced a 20% increase in same store sales during the current year as compared to the prior year due to increased rental demand, reflecting strength in general outage work.The All Other Operations business segment consists of six business units. The primary products manufactured and or distributed are carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, ammonia and refrigerant gases.The All Other Operations business segment sales increased 16% in total and 10% on a same store basis compared to the prior year, with incremental sales of 6% contributed by current and prior year acquisitions. The same store sales increase was primarily driven by an increase in ammonia sales, which increased on both a volume and price basis.Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation)Gross profits (excluding depreciation) do not reflect deductions related to depreciation expense and distribution costs. The Company reflects distribution costs as an element of selling, distribution and administrative expenses and recognizes depreciation on all of its property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings line item, Depreciation. Other companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their cost of products sold and, as such, the Companys gross profits (excluding depreciation) discussed below may not be comparable to those of other businesses.Consolidated gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 10% compared to the prior year, principally due to the same store sales increase for the current year. The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in the current year declined 80 basis points to 54.2% compared to 55.0% in the prior year. The decline in consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) reflects the continued shift in sales mix towards hardgoods, which carry lower gross profit margins (excluding depreciation) than gas and rent, a mix shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment, and increased sales to large customers, which generally carry lower gross profit margins (excluding depreciation) than small customers but at a lower net cost to serve. Years Ended Gross Profits (ex.

The Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was 54.7% versus 55.6% in the prior year, a decrease of 90 basis points. The decline in the Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) reflects the sales mix shift towards hardgoods and lower margin welding and automation equipment within hardgoods, as well as increased sales to larger customers. As a percentage of the Distribution business segments sales, gas and rent decreased 150 22Table of Contentsbasis points to 58.1% in the current year as compared to 59.6% in the prior year.The All Other Operations business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 15% compared to the prior year. The All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) decreased 30 basis points to 46.3% in the current year from 46.6% in the prior year. The decrease in the All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was primarily driven by lower margins in the ammonia business.Operating ExpensesSelling, Distribution and Administrative (SD&A) ExpensesSD&A expenses consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility related expenses. Consolidated SD&A expenses increased $154 million, or 10%, in the current year as compared to the prior year. Contributing to the increase in SD&A expenses were $113 million of higher variable costs associated with growing sales, such as sales commissions, salaries, production overtime and distribution costs, approximately $24 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses and $17 million of incremental costs associated with the SAP implementation. As a percentage of net sales, SD&A expenses decreased to 36.4% in the current year from 37.0% in the prior year.

For both business segments, the increases in SD&A costs were driven by higher variable costs on sales growth, including sales commissions, salaries, production overtime and distribution costs, and incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses of $14 million for the Distribution business segment and $10 million for the All Other Operations business segment. As a percentage of Distribution business segment net sales, SD&A expenses in the Distribution business segment decreased 110 basis points to 36.1% compared to 37.2% in the prior year driven by operating leverage on sales growth and by the shift in sales mix towards hardgoods. As a percentage of All Other Operations business segment net sales, SD&A expenses in the All Other Operations business segment increased 100 basis points to 29.5% compared to 28.5% in the prior year primarily driven by higher distribution costs, much of which are recovered through surcharge billings to customers.SD&A Expenses OtherEnterprise Information SystemThe Company continues its phased, multi year rollout of its highly customized SAP enterprise information system, whereby business units will implement the new system in succession. Through March 31, 2012, the Company has successfully converted its Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure businesses and five regional distribution companies to SAP. The Company continues to prepare for the implementation of SAP at the remainder of its business units. SAP costs incurred by the Company include pre implementation data conversion and training costs as well as post implementation monitoring, training and operating activities related to the scheduled business unit rollouts. SAP implementation costs for the current year were $33.0 million as compared to $16.4 million in the prior year. These costs were recorded as SD&A expenses and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. Multi employer Pension Plan WithdrawalsHistorically, the Company participated in several MEPPs providing defined benefits to union employees under the terms of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). Contributions were made to the plans in accordance with negotiated CBAs. The plans generally provided retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. In connection with the renewal of CBAs, the Company has been successful in negotiating its withdrawal from MEPPs, replacing those retirement plans for CBA employees with defined contribution plans. As part of the withdrawal from a MEPP, the Company is required to fund its portion of the MEPPs unfunded pension obligation, if any. The amount of the withdrawal 23Table of Contentsliability assessed by a MEPP is impacted by a number of factors, including investment returns, benefit levels, interest rates and continued participation by other employers in the MEPP. During the current year, the Company incurred MEPP withdrawal charges of $4.3 million, primarily related to the final withdrawal and assessment from its last remaining MEPP. During the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company incurred MEPP withdrawal charges of $4.6 million. These charges are reflected in selling, distribution and administrative expenses. As of March 31, 2012, the Company has successfully negotiated its withdrawal from all MEPPs in which it previously participated and has fully accrued for the related withdrawal assessments.Restructuring and Other Special ChargesThe following table presents the components of restructuring and other special charges for the current year: Year Ended(In thousands)March 31, 2012Restructuring costs$14,473Other related costs5,725Asset impairment charges$4,250Total restructuring and other special charges$24,448 Restructuring and Other Related CostsAs a result of the realignment of the Companys twelve regional distribution companies into four new divisions, and the consolidation of its regional company accounting and certain administrative functions into four newly created BSCs, the Company recorded $14.5 million in restructuring costs during the current year, primarily related to severance benefits to be paid out through fiscal 2014 and facility exit costs. Also during the current year, the Company incurred $5.7 million of other costs related to the divisional realignment and LLC formation. These costs primarily related to transition staffing for the BSCs, legal costs and other expenses associated with the Companys organizational and legal entity changes. The restructuring charges and other related costs were not allocated to the Companys business segments.The activity in the accrued liability balances associated with the restructuring plan was as follows for the year ended March 31, 2012:(In thousands)Severance Costs Facility Exit and Other Costs TotalBalance at March 31, 2011$ $ $Restructuring charges13,330 1,143 14,473Cash payments and other adjustments(192) (153) (345)Balance at March 31, 2012$13,138 $990 $14,128Asset ImpairmentsIn August 2011, the Company received 24 months notice that a suppliers hydrogen plant, which generates carbon dioxide as a by product that serves as the feedstock for the Companys co located liquid carbon dioxide plant, will cease operations in calendar year 2013. The Company expects the hydrogen plant to continue to supply the feedstock for its liquid carbon dioxide plant during the intervening period. As a result of an impairment analysis performed on the assets at this location, the Company recorded a charge of $2.5 million during the current year. Additionally, in March 2012, the Company re evaluated its plan for the operation of one of its smaller and less efficient air separation units (ASUs) over the long term. As a result of an impairment analysis performed on the assets at this location, the Company recorded a charge of $1.8 million during the current year. Total asset impairment charges for the current year were $4.3 million.Unsolicited Takeover AttemptOn February 11, 2010, Air Products initiated an unsolicited tender offer for all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with this unsolicited tender offer, Air Products filed an action against the Company and members of its Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On February 15, 2011, the Delaware Court of Chancery denied in their entirety all requests for relief by Air Products and dismissed with prejudice all claims asserted against the Company and its directors. 24Table of ContentsAir Products promptly terminated its unsolicited tender offer and no appeal of the Courts decision was filed. In responding to the unsolicited tender offer and related litigation, the Company incurred on a cumulative basis a net $60.0 million of legal and professional fees and other costs. During the current year, the Company recognized a $7.9 million benefit from lower than previously estimated net costs related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt of Airgas. During the prior year, the Company incurred $44.4 million of costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt. The net costs and benefits recognized related to the unsolicited takeover attempt were reflected as a separate line item in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings, and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation expense increased $20 million or 9%, to $245 million in the current year as compared to $225 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects the additional depreciation expense on capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand (such as cylinders and bulk tanks), $8 million of incremental depreciation expense related to the SAP enterprise information system and $4 million of additional depreciation expense on capital assets included in acquisitions. Total fiscal 2012 depreciation expense related to the SAP system of $10 million represents the expected full annual depreciation run rate without the benefits associated with full implementation of the system. Amortization expense of $25 million in the current year was consistent with that of the prior year. Operating IncomeConsolidated operating income of $556 million increased 19% in the current year driven by operating leverage on organic sales growth and $52 million of lower costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, which offset $24 million of incremental SD&A and depreciation expense related to the SAP implementation and $24 million of restructuring and other special charges. The consolidated operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 11.7% from 11.0% in the prior year, reflecting the impact of the above items.

The Distribution business segments operating income margin increased 50 basis points to 12.8% compared to 12.3% in the prior year. The operating income margin increase was driven by operating leverage on organic sales growth in the current year, which more than offset higher variable costs associated with sales growth.Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment increased 3% compared to the prior year. The All Other Operations business segments operating income margin of 12.3% decreased by 160 basis points compared to the operating income margin of 13.9% in the prior year. Interest Expense, Net and Losses on the Extinguishment of DebtInterest expense, net, was $66 million in the current year, representing an increase of $6 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year. The overall increase in interest expense, net, resulted primarily from higher average debt balances in the current period as compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the impact of stock repurchases and acquisitions.In September 2010, the Company replaced its then existing senior credit facility with a new credit facility. As a result of the early termination of the prior credit facility, the Company recognized a loss of $0.6 million associated with the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs during the prior year period. Additionally, the Company repurchased $30 million of its 7.125% senior subordinated notes due October 1, 2018 (the 2018 Notes) during the prior year period. In conjunction with the repurchase of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $3.6 million during the prior year period. The losses reflected the redemption premiums as well as the write off of the associated unamortized debt issuance costs.25Table of ContentsIncome Tax ExpenseThe effective income tax rate was 36.3% of pre tax earnings in the current year compared to 38.5% in the prior year. The decrease in effective income tax rates was due in part to the Companys recognition of a $4.9 million tax benefit (which reduced the effective income tax rate by approximately 1%) related to the LLC reorganization as well as a true up of its foreign tax liabilities. As a result of the Companys operating realignment into four divisions, the Company initiated a related change in its legal entity structure in which the majority of Airgas distribution businesses have merged or will merge into a single LLC, leading to the realization of certain state tax benefits that previously required a valuation allowance. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be between 37.5% and 38.0% of pre tax earnings.Net EarningsNet earnings per diluted share rose 36% to $4.00 in the current year compared to $2.94 in the prior year. Net earnings were $313.4 million compared to $250.3 million in the prior year. Net earnings per diluted share in the current and prior year periods included net special charges aggregating to $0.11 and $0.41 per diluted share, respectively. Net special charges in each period consisted of the following: Years Ended March 31,Effect on Diluted EPS2012 2011Restructuring and other special charges$0.19 $Costs (benefits) related to unsolicited takeover attempt(0.06) 0.33Multi employer pension plan withdrawal charges0.04 0.03Losses on the extinguishment of debt 0.03One time interest penalty 0.02Income tax benefits(0.06) Special charges, net$0.11 $0.41RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 OVERVIEW Airgas had net sales for fiscal 2011 of $4.3 billion compared to $3.9 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 (fiscal 2010), an increase of 10%. Total same store sales increased 8%, with hardgoods up 11% and gas and rent up 7%. Acquisitions contributed 2% sales growth in fiscal 2011. The same store sales growth for fiscal 2011 was driven by both volume and price, with sales volumes up 5% and pricing up 3%. The increase in sales volumes reflects accelerating growth in the Companys core business on strength in the manufacturing, utilities and petrochemical customer segments, as the manufacturing recovery that began in the central regions of the U.S. among the Companys larger customers expanded more broadly throughout the country and to smaller manufacturers. The Companys medical business also began to accelerate, and the Company experienced increased activity in customers using Airgas products and services for repair and maintenance operations. The increase in pricing reflects a broad based price increase on gas, rent and hardgoods effective June 1, 2010, and to a lesser extent, a price increase on gas, rent and other service charges on March 1, 2011. The pricing actions were designed to offset rising product, operating and distribution costs. The Companys operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 11.0% in fiscal 2011 compared to 10.3% in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011s operating income margin reflected a 110 basis point improvement in the operating income margin driven by operating leverage on sales growth in fiscal 2011, offset by $44.4 million in costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and $4.6 million in charges related to the Companys withdrawal from some of its MEPPs, which together reduced the Companys operating income margin by 120 basis points. The Companys operating income margin in fiscal 2010 reflected the impact of $23.4 million in costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges, which reduced fiscal 2010s operating income margin by 80 basis points. Net earnings per diluted share rose 26% to $2.94 in fiscal 2011 versus $2.34 in fiscal 2010. Net earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2011 included special charges aggregating to $0.41 per diluted share comprised of $0.33 per diluted share in costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, $0.03 per diluted share in MEPP withdrawal charges, $0.03 per diluted share in losses on the extinguishment of debt and $0.02 per diluted share for a one time interest penalty. Net earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2010 included net special charges aggregating to $0.34 per diluted share comprised of $0.18 per diluted share in costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, $0.05 per diluted share in MEPP withdrawal charges, $0.14 per diluted share in losses on the extinguishment of debt and a $0.03 per diluted share income tax benefit associated with the reorganization of 26Table of Contentscertain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment. The special charges reduced reported net earnings per diluted share by 12% in fiscal 2011 and 13% in fiscal 2010. STATEMENT OF EARNINGS COMMENTARY FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010 Net Sales Net sales increased 10% to $4.3 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, driven by same store sales growth of 8% and incremental sales of 2% contributed by acquisitions. Gas and rent same store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 11%. Same store sales were driven by increased volumes of 5% and price of 3%. Strategic products account for more than 40% of net sales and include safety products, bulk, medical and specialty gases, as well as carbon dioxide and dry ice. The Company has identified these products as strategic because it believes they have good long term growth profiles relative to the Companys core industrial gas and welding products due to favorable end customer markets, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross selling opportunities or a combination thereof. For fiscal 2011, sales of strategic products increased 9% on a same store sales basis as compared to fiscal 2010, which was slightly stronger than the overall same store sales increase of 8%.

The Distribution business segments gas and rent same store sales increased 6% with volumes and pricing each up 3%. Hardgoods same store sales increased 11% with volumes up 9% and pricing up 2%. Both gas and rent and hardgoods volumes reflect the overall improvement in economic activity, while the increase in pricing was primarily driven by the June 1, 2010 and March 1, 2011 price increases. Sales of strategic gas products sold through the Distribution business segment in fiscal 2011 increased 8% from fiscal 2010. Among strategic gas products, bulk gas sales were up 10% as bulk sales to industrial manufacturing and petrochemical customers continued to recover, and bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength. Sales of medical gases were up 4% as a result of new business signings, partially offset by a reduction in elective and non critical medical procedures, which reduced overall demand. Sales of specialty gases were up 8% driven primarily by higher volumes and increased demand for core specialty gases. The rising demand for the Companys core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of the Companys market position in EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, improving conditions in petrochemical markets and spot sales of certain rare gases in the fiscal second quarter. Contributing to the rise in Distribution business segment hardgoods same store sales were increases in both safety products and the Companys Radnor private label brand product line. Safety product sales increased 13% in fiscal 2011, comparing favorably to the overall hardgoods same store sales increase of 11% and reflecting broad based increases that were most pronounced in the manufacturing customer base. The Companys Radnor private label line was up 15% for fiscal 2011, driven by the overall increase in hardgoods volumes. Sales of core industrial gases, which experienced the sharpest volume declines during the recession, increased 6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, reflecting accelerating growth in the Companys core business. Revenues from the Companys rental welder business experienced a 5% decline in same store sales during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of continued weakness in non residential construction. The All Other Operations business segment sales increased 12% in total and on a same store basis compared to fiscal 2010. The sales increase was driven by higher pricing and volumes for certain products in the refrigerants business and for ammonia used in DeNOx applications and chemicals processing, as well as higher volumes in the carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses.27Table of ContentsGross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Consolidated gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 9% compared to fiscal 2010, principally due to the same store sales increase in fiscal 2011. The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in fiscal 2011 declined 40 basis points to 55.0% compared to 55.4% in fiscal 2010. The decline in consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) primarily reflects the sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods that is characteristic of an industrial economic recovery.

The Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was 55.6% versus 56.0% in fiscal 2010, a decrease of 40 basis points. The decline in the Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) largely reflects the shift in sales mix toward hardgoods, which carry lower gross profit margins (excluding depreciation) than gas and rent. As a percentage of the Distribution business segments sales, gas and rent decreased 120 basis points to 59.6% in the current year as compared to 60.8% in fiscal 2010. The All Other Operations business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 11% compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of favorable pricing and product mix for the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses. The All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) decreased 50 basis points to 46.6% in fiscal 2011 from 47.1% in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was primarily driven by higher costs in the ammonia business relative to pricing. Operating Expenses Consolidated SD&A expenses increased $85 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Contributing to the increase in SD&A expenses were $65 million of higher variable costs associated with growing sales, such as sales commissions, performance bonuses, production overtime and distribution costs, approximately $13 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses and $9 million in incremental costs associated with the SAP implementation, slightly offset by $2 million of lower MEPP withdrawal charges. As a percentage of net sales, SD&A expense decreased 140 basis points to 37.0% compared to 38.4% in fiscal 2010 driven by operating leverage on sales growth and by the shift in sales mix to hardgoods, which carry lower operating expenses in relation to sales and corresponding lower gross margins. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports SD&A expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs in the Other line item in the table below.

For both business segments, the increases in SD&A costs were driven by higher variable costs on sales growth, including sales commissions, performance bonuses, production overtime and distribution costs, and approximately $13 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses, the majority of which was incurred in the Distribution business segment. As a percentage of Distribution business segment net sales, SD&A expense in the Distribution business segment decreased 160 basis points to 37.2% compared to 38.8% in fiscal 2010, driven by operating leverage on sales growth and by the shift in sales mix to hardgoods. As a percentage of All Other Operations business segment net sales, SD&A expense in the All Other Operations business segment decreased 170 basis points to 28.5% compared to 30.2% in fiscal 2010, driven 28Table of Contentsprimarily by operating leverage on sales growth in the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses. Enterprise Information System On July 5, 2010, the Company began its phased, multi year rollout of its highly customized SAP enterprise information system, whereby business units will implement the new system in succession, with the successful conversion of its Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure business to SAP. On April 4, 2011, the first regional distribution company successfully converted to SAP. SAP costs for fiscal 2011 were $16.4 million as compared to $7.4 million in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting the post implementation monitoring, training and operating activities following the rollout of SAP to the Companys Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure business, and pre implementation data conversion and training related to the rollout of SAP to the first regional distribution company. These costs were recorded as SD&A expenses and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. Multi employer Pension Plan Withdrawals MEPP withdrawal costs for fiscal 2011 were $4.6 million and related to the ratification of certain CBAs up for renewal as well as revised estimated withdrawal liabilities from two plan administrators. In connection with the renewal of certain labor contracts during fiscal 2010, the Company recognized MEPP withdrawal charges of $6.7 million in fiscal 2010. These charges were reflected in SD&A expenses and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. Unsolicited Takeover Attempt On February 11, 2010, Air Products initiated an unsolicited tender offer for all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with this unsolicited takeover attempt, Air Products filed an action against the Company and members of its Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In the suit, Air Products sought, among other things, an order declaring that members of the Companys Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products. Additionally, a number of purported stockholder class action lawsuits were commenced against the Company and or the members of the Airgas Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. These suits, which were later consolidated, alleged, among other things, that the members of the Airgas Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products, failing to seek more valuable alternatives and failing to redeem the Companys shareholder rights plan. Air Products also initiated a proxy contest to elect three directors to Airgas Board and to amend certain provisions of the Companys By Laws. At the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company on September 15, 2010, the three nominees of Air Products were elected to the Companys Board of Directors and a majority of the shares voted, though less than 67% of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote, were voted in favor of the By Law amendments proposed by Air Products. Airgas and certain of its directors initiated an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that the By Law amendment requiring that an annual meeting be held on January 18, 2011, only four months after the September 15, 2010 annual meeting, was invalid under both Delaware law and Airgas charter. In a ruling dated October 8, 2010, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the By Law amendment was valid. Airgas and the directors involved appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court of Delaware and on November 23, 2010, the Supreme Court of Delaware found that the By Law amendment was invalid and reversed the judgment of the Court of Chancery. On February 15, 2011, the Delaware Court of Chancery denied in their entirety all requests for relief by Air Products and by the plaintiffs in the stockholder class action lawsuits, and dismissed with prejudice all claims asserted against the Company and its directors. Air Products promptly terminated its unsolicited tender offer and no appeal of the Courts decision was filed by Air Products or the stockholder plaintiffs. During fiscal 2011, the Company incurred $44.4 million of legal and professional fees and other costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and the related litigation compared to $23.4 million in fiscal 2010. The costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt were reflected as a separate line item in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings, and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense of $225 million increased $13 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to $213 million in fiscal 2010. The increase primarily reflects capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand (such as cylinders and bulk tanks) and $2 million of incremental depreciation expense related to the SAP enterprise information system. Amortization expense of $25 million in fiscal 2011 increased by $3 million as compared to fiscal 2010 reflecting amortization of intangibles acquired during both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Operating Income Consolidated operating income of $469 million increased 17% in fiscal 2011 driven by operating leverage on sales 29Table of Contentsgrowth which more than offset the impact of costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, higher variable costs associated with sales growth, and incremental SAP implementation costs, slightly offset by lower MEPP withdrawal charges. The consolidated operating income margin, which was negatively impacted by significant costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, increased to 11.0% from 10.3% in fiscal 2010. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports SD&A expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs in the Other line item in the table below. Additionally, the legal and professional fees and other costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt are not allocated to the Companys business segments, and are also reflected in the Other line item in the table below.

The Distribution business segments operating income margin increased 120 basis points to 12.3% compared to 11.1% in fiscal 2010. The operating income margin increase was driven by operating leverage on sales growth in fiscal 2011 which more than offset higher variable costs associated with sales growth. Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment increased 25% compared to fiscal 2010. The All Other Operations business segments operating income margin of 13.9% was 140 basis points higher than the operating income margin of 12.5% in fiscal 2010. The increase in operating margin was driven primarily by operating leverage on sales growth in the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses, partially offset by the impact of gross margin compression in the ammonia business. Interest Expense, Net, Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt Interest expense, net, was $60 million in fiscal 2011, representing a decrease of approximately $9 million, or 13%, compared to interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables in fiscal 2010. As a result of a change in accounting treatment effective April 1, 2010 related to the Companys trade receivables securitization program, costs formerly recognized as discount on securitization of trade receivables, which represented the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale, are now reflected as interest expense, consistent with the new accounting treatment. The overall decrease in interest expense, net (including the discount on securitization of trade receivables in fiscal 2010) resulted primarily from lower average debt balances in fiscal 2011 as compared to aggregate debt and trade receivables securitization balances in fiscal 2010, partially offset by a $2.6 million one time interest penalty in fiscal 2011 related to the 2018 Notes. Interest Penalty During fiscal 2011, the Company incurred a one time interest penalty to the holders of its 2018 Notes in the amount of $2.6 million related to the late removal of the restrictive legend on these notes. In issuing the 2018 Notes, the Company utilized a newly available technology that has since become obsolete, wherein it was incumbent upon Airgas to remove the restrictive legend from the 2018 Notes at the end of the restricted transfer period. Failure to do so required the payment of an interest penalty to holders of the 2018 Notes, which the Company promptly addressed when it identified the oversight. The Company has classified this penalty as interest expense. Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in the Securitization Agreement with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis. The maximum amount of the Securitization Agreement is $295 million. On April 1, 2010, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which affected the presentation of its Securitization Agreement. Under the new guidance, proceeds received under the Securitization Agreement are treated as secured borrowings, whereas previously they were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables. Furthermore, the new accounting treatment resulted in the recognition of both the trade receivables securitized under the agreement and the borrowings they collateralize on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet, which led to a $295 million increase in trade receivables and long term debt. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated net earnings as a result of the change in accounting principle. Additionally, the Companys debt covenants were not impacted by the balance sheet recognition of the borrowings under the new accounting 30Table of Contentsguidance, as borrowings under the Securitization Agreement were already factored into the debt covenant calculations. Financing and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt In September 2010, the Company replaced its then existing senior credit facility with a new credit facility. As a result of the early termination of the prior credit facility, the Company recognized a loss of $0.6 million associated with the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, during fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased $30 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 110.6% of the principal. In conjunction with the repurchase of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $3.6 million. The losses reflected the redemption premiums as well as the write off of associated unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the fiscal 2010 repurchase of $154 million of the 2018 Notes and the redemption in full of the $150 million 6.25% senior subordinated notes due July 15, 2014 (the 2004 Notes), the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million in fiscal 2010. The losses related to the redemption premiums and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.5% of pre tax earnings in fiscal 2011 compared to 37.5% in fiscal 2010. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of tax benefits of $2.2 million associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. Net Earnings Net earnings were $250 million, or $2.94 per diluted share, compared to $196 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011s net earnings include costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt of $44.4 million ($28.0 million after tax) or $0.33 per diluted share, charges related to withdrawals from MEPPs of $4.6 million ($2.8 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share, losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million ($2.6 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share and costs related to the one time interest penalty of $2.6 million ($1.7 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. Fiscal 2010s net earnings include costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt of $23.4 million ($14.8 million after tax) or $0.18 per diluted share, charges related to withdrawals from MEPPs of $6.7 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share, losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million ($11.3 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share and a one time income tax benefit of $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash FlowsNet cash provided by operating activities was $506 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $275 million in fiscal 2011 and $600 million in fiscal 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by new accounting guidance adopted by the Company on April 1, 2010 that affected the presentation of the Securitization Agreement. As a result of implementing the new guidance, funding under the agreement of $295 million on April 1, 2010 was reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a use of cash from the securitization of trade receivables in operating activities and as a source of cash in financing activities.The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting the Companys cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented: Years Ended March 31,(In thousands)2012 2011 2010Net earnings$313,374 $250,264 $196,266Non cash and non operating activities (1)368,942 348,965 344,846Trade receivables securitization (295,000) (16,400)Changes in working capital(179,562) (27,701) 79,320Other operating activities3,652 (1,227) (3,985)Net cash provided by operating activities$506,406 $275,301 $600,047(1) Includes depreciation, amortization, asset impairment charges, deferred income taxes, loss on sales of plant and equipment, stock based compensation expense and losses on the extinguishment of debt.31Table of ContentsThe increase in the use of cash for working capital in fiscal 2012 was driven by increases in working capital to support sales growth and the payout of fiscal 2011 accrued annual incentive compensation, as well as payments for professional fees related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt in fiscal 2011 and payments related to the Companys final MEPP withdrawal assessments. Working capital provided cash in fiscal 2010 primarily driven by lower inventory and accounts receivable balances, reflecting the recessions impact on declining sales in fiscal 2010. Net earnings adjusted for non cash and non operating items provided cash of $682 million versus $599 million in fiscal 2011 and $541 million in fiscal 2010.

Capital expenditures in all periods also reflect the development and implementation of the Companys highly customized SAP system. Capital expenditures as a percent of sales was 7.5%, 6.0% and 6.5%, respectively, for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010. Payments for business acquisitions and holdback settlements in fiscal 2012 also increased significantly from the prior years due to renewed activity in the acquisitions market. Free cash flow* in fiscal 2012 was $262 million, compared to $387 million in fiscal 2011 and $412 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior years reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support sales growth.The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting the Companys cash flows from financing activities for the periods presented: Years Ended March 31,(In thousands)2012 2011 2010Net cash borrowings (repayments) exclusive of trade receivables securitization$305,788 $35,593 $(253,868)Proceeds from trade receivables securitization 295,000 Purchase of treasury stock(300,000) (300,000) Dividends paid to stockholders(95,323) (83,797) (62,526)Other financing activities72,668 49,887 38,441Net cash used in financing activities$(16,867) $(3,317) $(277,953) In fiscal 2012, net financing activities used cash of $17 million. Net borrowings were a source of $306 million, primarily related to the issuance of $250 million of 2.95% senior notes maturing on June 15, 2016. The Company authorized and completed a share repurchase program purchasing 4.5 million shares of treasury stock for $300 million. Other financing activities, primarily comprised of proceeds and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and stock issued for the employee stock purchase plan, generated cash of $73 million.In fiscal 2011, net financing activities used cash of $3 million. Net borrowings exclusive of the trade receivables securitization were a source of $36 million. As noted above under operating activities, the change in accounting principle for the Securitization Agreement was reflected as a financing source of cash of $295 million, but had no impact on the Companys net cash position as an equal and offsetting amount was reflected as a use of cash in operating activities. The Company authorized and completed a share repurchase program purchasing 4.8 million shares of treasury stock for $300 million. Other financing activities, primarily comprised of proceeds and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and stock issued for the employee stock purchase plan, generated cash of $50 million.In fiscal 2010, net financing activities used cash of $278 million. Strong operating cash flows enabled the Company to 32Table of Contentsmake a net debt repayment of $254 million. Other financing activities, primarily comprised of proceeds and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and stock issued for the employee stock purchase plan, generated cash of $38 million.*See Non GAAP reconciliations below.DividendsIn fiscal 2012, the Company paid its stockholders $95 million or $0.32 per share in the second through fourth quarters and $0.29 per share in the first quarter. During fiscal 2011, the Company paid dividends of $84 million or $0.22 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 per share in the second and third quarters and $0.29 per share in the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2010, the Company paid its stockholders $63 million or $0.18 at the end of each of the first three quarters and $0.22 in the fourth quarter. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors.Financial InstrumentsCommercial PaperIn October 2011, the Company commenced a $750 million commercial paper program supported by its $750 million revolving credit facility (see below). This program allows the Company to obtain favorable short term borrowing rates with maturities that may vary, but will generally not exceed 90 days from the date of issue. The Company has used proceeds from the commercial paper program to pay down amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2012, $388 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program and the average effective interest rate on these borrowings was 0.54%.Senior Credit FacilityOn July 19, 2011, the Company entered into a $750 million Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) to amend and restate the prior credit facility dated September 13, 2010. The Credit Facility consists of a $650 million U.S. dollar revolving credit line and a $100 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) multi currency revolving credit line. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is July 19, 2016. Under circumstances described in the Credit Facility, the revolving credit line may be increased by an additional $325 million, provided that the multi currency revolving credit line may not be increased by more than an additional $50 million.As of March 31, 2012, the Company had $43 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility, all of which were under the multi currency revolver. There were no borrowings under the U.S. dollar revolver at March 31, 2012. The Company also had outstanding U.S. letters of credit of $45 million issued under the Credit Facility. U.S. dollar revolver borrowings bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 125 basis points. The multi currency revolver bears interest based on a rate of 125 basis points over the Euro currency rate applicable to each foreign currency borrowing. As of March 31, 2012, the average effective interest rate on the multi currency revolver was 1.93%.At March 31, 2012, the financial covenant of the Credit Facility did not restrict the Companys ability to borrow on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, failure to make payments, a cross default to certain other debt, breaches of covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, certain monetary judgments and bankruptcy and ERISA events. In the event of default, repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility may be accelerated. The Company also maintains a committed revolving line of credit of up to 8.0 million (U.S. $10.7 million) to fund its operations in France. These revolving credit borrowings are outside of the Companys Credit Facility. At March 31, 2012, these revolving credit borrowings were 4.8 million (U.S. $6.3 million). The variable interest rates on the French revolving credit borrowings are based on the Euro currency rate plus 125 basis points. As of March 31, 2012, the effective interest rate on the French revolving credit borrowings was 1.7%. This line of credit matures on December 31, 2012.Total Borrowing CapacityAs of March 31, 2012, $273 million remained unused under the Companys Credit Facility, after giving effect to the borrowings under the commercial paper program backstopped by the Credit Facility, the outstanding U.S. letters of credit and the borrowings under the multi currency revolver.The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity from cash from operations and under its revolving credit facilities to meet its working capital, capital expenditure and other financial commitments. The financial covenant under the Companys Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.5. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting debt and, historically, the amounts outstanding under the Securitization Agreement 33Table of Contentsdivided by a contractually defined Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for the trailing twelve month period with pro forma adjustments for acquisitions. The financial covenant calculations of the Credit Facility include the pro forma results of acquired businesses. Therefore, total borrowing capacity is not reduced dollar for dollar with acquisition financing. The leverage ratio measures the Companys ability to meet current and future obligations. At March 31, 2012, the Companys leverage ratio was 2.6.The Company continually evaluates alternative financing and believes that it can obtain financing on reasonable terms. The terms of any future financing arrangements depend on market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time.Money Market LoansThe Company has an agreement with a financial institution that provides access to short term advances not to exceed $35 million that expires on July 31, 2012, but may be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The advances are generally overnight or for up to seven days. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March 31, 2012, there were no advances outstanding under the agreement.The Company also has an agreement with another financial institution to provide access to additional short term advances not to exceed $35 million. The agreement expires on January 2, 2013, but may be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The advances may be for one to six months with rates at a fixed spread over the corresponding LIBOR. At March 31, 2012, there were no advances outstanding under the agreement. Senior NotesOn June 3, 2011, the Company issued $250 million of 2.95% senior notes maturing on June 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes). The 2016 Notes were issued at a discount with a yield of 2.980%. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2016 Notes were used to fund acquisitions and repurchase shares under the Companys stock repurchase program. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semi annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. At March 31, 2012, the Company had $300 million outstanding of 2.85% senior notes maturing on October 1, 2013 (the 2013 Notes). The 2013 Notes were issued at a discount with a yield of 2.871%. Interest on the 2013 Notes is payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year.At March 31, 2012, the Company had $400 million outstanding of 4.5% senior notes maturing on September 15, 2014 (the 2014 Notes). The 2014 Notes were issued at a discount with a yield of 4.527%. Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year.At March 31, 2012, the Company had $250 million outstanding of 3.25% senior notes maturing on October 1, 2015 (the 2015 Notes). The 2015 Notes were issued at a discount with a yield of 3.283%. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year.The 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) contain covenants that could restrict the incurrence of liens and limit sale and leaseback transactions. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the Senior Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make whole payments. Senior Subordinated NotesAt March 31, 2012, the Company had $215 million outstanding of 7.125% senior subordinated notes maturing on October 1, 2018 (the 2018 Notes). Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2018 Notes have a redemption provision which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2018 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is October 1, 2013 at a price of 103.563% of the principal amount.Other Long term DebtThe Companys other long term debt primarily consists of vendor financing of rental welders, capitalized lease obligations and notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired, which are repayable in periodic installments. At March 31, 2012, other long term debt totaled $6.1 million with an average interest rate of approximately 6% and an average maturity of approximately one year.Trade Receivables SecuritizationThe Company participates in the Securitization Agreement with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade 34Table of Contentsreceivables on a revolving basis. The Companys sale of qualified trade receivables is accounted for as a secured borrowing under which qualified trade receivables collateralize amounts borrowed from the commercial banks. Trade receivables that collateralize the Securitization Agreement are held in a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes and represents the Companys only variable interest entity. Qualified trade receivables in the amount of the outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement are not available to the general creditors of the Company. The maximum amount of the Securitization Agreement is $295 million and it bears interest at approximately LIBOR plus 70 basis points. At March 31, 2012, the amount of outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement was $295 million, and it was classified as long term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts borrowed under the Securitization Agreement could fluctuate monthly based on the Companys funding requirements and the level of qualified trade receivables available to collateralize the Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreement expires in December 2013 and contains customary events of termination, including standard cross default provisions with respect to outstanding debt.Debt Extinguishment ChargesDuring the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company repurchased $30.0 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 110.6% of the principal. Losses on the early extinguishment of debt from the repurchase of the 2018 Notes were $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2011 and related to the redemption premiums and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs.Also during the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company entered into a new credit facility. In connection with the entry by the Company into the credit facility on September 13, 2010, the Companys then existing senior credit facility was terminated and all obligations under the prior credit facility (including the term loans) were repaid in full using proceeds of the credit facility and other funds. As a result of the termination of the prior credit facility, the Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million during the year ended March 31, 2011 related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs.On October 13, 2009, the Company redeemed its $150.0 million, 6.25% senior subordinated notes maturing July 15, 2014 at a price of 103.125% of the principal. A loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $6.1 million was recognized related to the redemption premium and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Also during the year ended March 31, 2010, the Company repurchased $154.6 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 106.4% of the principal. Losses on the early extinguishment of debt from the repurchase of the 2018 Notes were $11.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2010 and related to the redemption premiums and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs.Interest Rate DerivativesThe Company previously designated fixed interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges of interest payments on certain of the Companys variable rate debt instruments. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings. For the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the liability for the fixed interest rate swap agreements decreased and the Company recorded a corresponding adjustment to AOCI of $4.0 million, or $2.7 million after tax, and $8.6 million, or $5.6 million after tax, respectively. The amount of gain or loss recorded in current earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated cash flow hedges was immaterial for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.At March 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company was party to no fixed interest rate swap agreements. In anticipation of the issuance of the 2015 Notes, the Company entered into a treasury rate lock agreement in July 2010 with a notional amount of $100 million that matured in September 2010. The treasury rate lock agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge of the semi annual interest payments associated with the forecasted issuance of the 2015 Notes. When the treasury rate lock agreement matured, the Company realized a loss of $2.6 million ($1.6 million after tax) which was reported as a component within AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings over the term of the 2015 Notes. For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, $517 thousand and $258 thousand, respectively, of the loss on the treasury rate lock was reclassified to interest expense. At March 31, 2012, the estimated loss recorded in AOCI on the treasury rate lock agreement that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $517 thousand ($326 thousand after tax).The Company also has variable interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. At March 31, 2012, the Company had five variable interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional amount of $300 35Table of Contentsmillion. These variable interest rates swaps effectively convert the Companys $300 million of fixed rate 2013 Notes to variable rate debt. At March 31, 2012, these swap agreements required the Company to make variable interest payments based on a weighted average forward rate of 1.35% and receive fixed interest payments from the counterparties based on a fixed rate of 2.85%. The maturity of these fair value swaps coincides with the maturity date of the Companys 2013 Notes in October 2013. During the year ended March 31, 2012, the fair value of the variable interest rate swaps increased by $1.6 million to an asset of $6.7 million and was recorded in other non current assets. The corresponding increase in the carrying value of the 2013 Notes caused by the hedged risk was $1.6 million and was recorded in long term debt. The Company records the gain or loss on the hedged item (i.e., the 2013 Notes) and the gain or loss on the variable interest rate swaps in interest expense. The net gain or loss recorded in earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated fair value hedges was immaterial for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.The Company measures the fair value of its interest rate swaps using observable market rates to calculate the forward yield curves used to determine expected cash flows for each interest rate swap agreement. The discounted present values of the expected cash flows are calculated using the same forward yield curve. The discount rate assumed in the fair value calculations is adjusted for non performance risk, dependent on the classification of the interest rate swap as an asset or liability. If an interest rate swap is a liability, the Company assesses the credit and non performance risk of Airgas by determining an appropriate credit spread for entities with similar credit characteristics as the Company. If, however, an interest rate swap is in an asset position, a credit analysis of counterparties is performed assessing the credit and non performance risk based upon the pricing history of counterparty specific credit default swaps or credit spreads for entities with similar credit ratings to the counterparties. The Company does not believe it is at risk for non performance by its counterparties. However, if an interest rate swap is in an asset position, the failure of one or more of its counterparties would result in an increase in interest expense and a reduction of earnings. The Company compares its fair value calculations to the contract settlement values calculated by the counterparties for each swap agreement for reasonableness.Interest ExpenseA majority of the Companys variable rate debt is based on a spread over LIBOR. Based on the Companys fixed to variable interest rate ratio, for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase by approximately $2.6 million.Non GAAP ReconciliationsAdjusted Cash from Operations and Free Cash Flow Years Ended March 31,(In thousands)201220112010Net cash provided by operating activities$506,406$275,301$600,047Adjustments to net cash provided by operating activities: Cash used by the securitization of trade receivables295,00016,400Stock issued for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan15,25614,99715,428Tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options17,5168,44415,444Net cash expenditures related to unsolicited takeover attempt35,08423,427963Cash expenditures related to MEPP withdrawals18,323Adjusted cash from operations592,585617,169648,282Capital expenditures(356,514)(256,030)(252,828)Adjustments to capital expenditures: Proceeds from sales of plant and equipment16,36515,84414,466Operating lease buyouts9,2189,8931,687Adjusted capital expenditures(330,931)(230,293)(236,675)Free cash flow$261,654$386,876$411,607The Company believes that free cash flow provides investors meaningful insight into the Companys ability to generate cash from operations without the impact of cash used related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and MEPP withdrawals, which is available for servicing debt obligations and for the execution of its business strategies, including acquisitions, the prepayment of debt, the payment of dividends or to support other investing and financing activities.

It should be noted as well that our free cash flow metric may be 36Table of Contentsdifferent from free cash flow metrics provided by other companies.OTHERCritical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets, business insurance reserves and deferred income tax assets. Uncertainties about future events make these estimates susceptible to change. Management evaluates these estimates regularly and believes they are the best estimates, appropriately made, given the known facts and circumstances. For the three years ended March 31, 2012, there were no material changes in the valuation methods or assumptions used by management. However, actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are critical due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for these matters, their susceptibility to change and the potential impact that different assumptions could have on operating performance. Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes sales returns, sales allowances and bad debts. The allowance adjusts the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on estimates of accounts that will not ultimately be collected. An allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established as trade receivables age beyond their due dates. As past due balances age, higher valuation allowances are established lowering the net carrying value of receivables. The amount of valuation allowance established for each past due period reflects the Companys historical collections experience and current economic conditions and trends. The Company also establishes valuation allowances for specific problem accounts and bankruptcies. The amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions, the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions, the financial condition of individual customers and the terms of reorganization for accounts emerging from bankruptcy. Changes in these conditions impact the Companys collection experience and may result in the recognition of higher or lower valuation allowances. Management evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Historically, bad debt expense reflected in the Companys financial results has generally been in the range of 0.3% to 0.5% of net sales. The Company has a low concentration of credit risk due to its broad and diversified customer base across multiple industries and geographic locations, and its relatively low average order size. The Companys largest customer accounts for approximately 0.5% of total net sales. Inventories The Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of the products the Company carries in inventory have long shelf lives and are not subject to technological obsolescence. The Company writes its inventory down to its estimated market value when it believes the market value is below cost. The Company estimates its ability to recover the costs of items in inventory by product type based on its age, the rate at which that product line is turning in inventory, its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The ability of the Company to recover its cost for products in inventory can be affected by factors such as future customer demand, general market conditions and the relationship with significant suppliers. Management evaluates the recoverability of its inventory at least quarterly. In aggregate, inventory turns four to five times per year. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that they may be impaired. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October 31 of each year. In performing tests for goodwill impairment, the Company is first permitted to perform a qualitative assessment about the likelihood of the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeding its fair value. If an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment, it is required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described below to identify the potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss, if any, to be recognized for that reporting unit. However, if an entity concludes otherwise based on the qualitative assessment, the two step goodwill impairment test is not required. The option to perform the qualitative assessment is not an accounting policy election and can be utilized at the Companys discretion. Further, the qualitative assessment need not be applied to all reporting units in a given goodwill impairment test. For an individual reporting unit, if the Company elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company must perform the two 37Table of Contentsstep goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit.In applying the two step process, the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. For this purpose, the Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of its reporting units. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margins, future capital expenditures, working capital needs, discount rates and perpetual growth rates. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated potential impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in step one, is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is not permitted. The discount rate, sales growth and profitability assumptions, and perpetual growth rate are the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing industry with an equity size premium added, as applicable, for each reporting unit. The WACC is calculated based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pre tax cost of debt) are based on market data at a point in time. Other data (such as beta and the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time. The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. The Companys analysis uses internally generated budgets and long range forecasts. The Companys discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in these budgets and forecasts about sales trends, inflation, working capital needs and forecasted capital expenditures along with an estimate of the reporting units terminal value (the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period) to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys assumptions about working capital needs and capital expenditures are based on historical experience. The perpetual growth rate assumed in the discounted cash flow model was in line with the long term growth rate as measured by the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and the industrys long term rate of growth. The Company believes the assumptions used in its discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, the Company may not meet its sales growth and profitability targets, working capital needs and capital expenditures may be higher than forecast, changes in credit markets may result in changes to the Companys discount rate and general business conditions may result in changes to the Companys terminal value assumptions for its reporting units. In performing the October 31, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company bypassed the option to perform a qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units. The assessment indicated that the fair values of most reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by a substantial amount. Furthermore, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the fair value of each reporting unit would not indicate that goodwill associated with any reporting unit was potentially impaired. For one reporting unit in the All Other Operations business segment, the excess of the estimated fair value over its carrying value declined from the prior years goodwill impairment assessment. The Company will continue to monitor this business and consider interim analyses of goodwill as appropriate; however, the amount of goodwill associated with this reporting unit is not material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Insurance Reserves The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, these programs had deductible limits of $1 million per occurrence. For fiscal 2013, the deductible limits will remain $1 million per occurrence. The Company reserves for its deductible based on individual claim evaluations, establishing loss estimates for known claims based on the current facts and circumstances. These known claims are then developed through actuarial computations to reflect the expected ultimate loss for the known claims as well as incurred but not reported claims. Actuarial computations use the Companys specific loss history, payment patterns and insurance coverage, plus industry trends and other factors to estimate the required reserve for all open claims by policy year and loss type. Reserves for the Companys deductible are evaluated monthly. Semi annually, the Company obtains a third party actuarial report to validate that the computations and assumptions used are consistent with actuarial standards. Certain 38Table of Contentsassumptions used in the actuarial computations are susceptible to change. Loss development factors are influenced by items such as medical inflation, changes in workers compensation laws and changes in the Companys loss payment patterns, all of which can have a significant influence on the estimated ultimate loss related to the Companys deductible. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of open claims may be for amounts that differ from the reserve balances. The Companys operations are spread across a significant number of locations, which helps to mitigate the potential impact of any given event that could give rise to an insurance related loss. Over the last three years, business insurance expense has been approximately 0.6% of net sales. Income Taxes At March 31, 2012, the Company had deferred tax assets of $119.9 million (net of valuation allowances of $5.3 million), deferred tax liabilities of $864.2 million and a net $12.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the Company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes and net operating loss carryforwards. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred income tax assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforward deferred tax assets become deductible or utilized. Management considers the reversal of taxable temporary differences and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets reverse, at March 31, 2012, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances. Unrecognized tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns that have not been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the Companys tax positions. The Companys practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. The Company does not anticipate significant changes in the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits over the next year. 39Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table presents the Companys contractual obligations as of March 31, 2012: (In thousands) Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal Less Than 1 Year (a) 1 to 3 Years (a) 3 to 5 Years (a) More than 5Years (a)Long term debt (1)$1,766,406 $10,385 $996,718 $543,857 $215,446Estimated interest payments on long term debt (2)225,641 61,580 96,534 44,801 22,726Estimated receipts on interest rate swap agreements (3)(6,734) (6,734) Non compete agreements (4)21,246 5,784 8,623 6,493 346Letters of credit (5)44,531 44,531 Operating leases (6)313,933 86,075 113,581 59,740 54,537Airgas, Inc.

The Senior Notes are presented at their maturity values rather than their carrying values, which are net of aggregate discounts of $0.9 million at March 31, 2012. The 2013 Notes also include additional carrying value of $6.8 million at March 31, 2012 related to the Companys fair value hedges. Long term debt includes capital lease obligations, which were not material and therefore, did not warrant separate disclosure.(2) The future interest payments on the Companys long term debt obligations were estimated based on the current outstanding principal reduced by scheduled maturities in each period presented and interest rates as of March 31, 2012. The actual interest payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of long term debt outstanding and actual interest rates in future periods.(3) Receipts under interest rate swap agreements result from changes in market interest rates compared to contractual rates and payments to be exchanged between the parties to the agreements. The estimated receipts in future periods were determined based on forward LIBOR rates as of March 31, 2012. Actual receipts may differ materially from those presented above based on actual interest rates in future periods.(4) Non compete agreements are obligations of the Company to make scheduled future payments, generally to former owners of acquired businesses, contingent upon their compliance with the covenants of the non compete agreements.(5) Letters of credit are guarantees of payment to third parties. The Companys letters of credit principally back obligations associated with the Companys deductible on workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. The letters of credit are supported by the Companys Credit Facility.(6) The Companys operating leases at March 31, 2012 include approximately $194 million in fleet vehicles under long term operating leases. The Company guarantees a residual value of $25 million related to its leased vehicles.(7) In May 2011, the Company announced its plan to realign its twelve regional companies accounting and certain administrative functions into four divisional Business Support Centers. As a result of this realignment, the Company incurred severance charges of $13.3 million associated with benefits expected to be paid under the Airgas, Inc. Severance Pay Plan to employees whose jobs are eliminated as a result of the realignment. The Companys obligation at March 31, 2012 represents the balance of accrued severance that has not yet been paid. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.40Table of Contents(8) In addition to the gas volumes supplied by Airgas Merchant Gases, the Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements under contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases. The Company has a long term take or pay supply agreement, in effect through August 31, 2017, with Air Products to supply the Company with bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon. Additionally, the Company purchases helium and hydrogen gas from Air Products under the long term supply agreement. Based on the volume of fiscal 2012 purchases, the Air Products supply agreement represents approximately $55 million annually in bulk gas purchases.The Company also has long term take or pay supply agreements with Linde AG to purchase oxygen, nitrogen, argon and helium. The agreements expire at various dates through July 2019 and represent approximately $41 million in annual bulk gas purchases. Additionally, the Company has long term take or pay supply agreements to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon from other major producers. Annual purchases under these contracts are approximately $20 million and they expire at various dates through 2024.The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2012 purchases. The supply agreements noted above contain periodic adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analysis. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.(9) The Company is a party to long term take or pay supply agreements for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide with approximately 15 suppliers that expire at various dates through 2044. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2012 purchases. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. Certain of the liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements contain market pricing subject to certain economic indices.(10) The Company purchases ammonia from a variety of sources.(11) Other purchase commitments primarily include property, plant and equipment expenditures.(12) Construction commitments represent an outstanding commitment to a customer to construct an on site air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Companys borrowing agreements. Interest rate derivatives are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company has not established, and will not establish, any interest rate risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources or anticipated funding sources. The counterparties to interest rate derivatives are major financial institutions. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long term credit ratings of at least a single A rating by one of the major credit rating agencies. In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non performance by the counterparties.The table below summarizes the Companys market risks associated with debt obligations and interest rate swaps at March 31, 2012. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate swaps, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period.(In millions)3/31/2013 3/31/2014 3/31/2015 3/31/2016 3/31/2017 Thereafter Total Fair ValueFixed Rate Debt: Other long term debt$4.0 $1.2 $0.5 $0.2 $0.2 $ $6.1 $6.4Interest expense0.2 0.1 0.04 0.01 0.4 Average interest rate5.72% 5.54% 5.62% 5.55% 2.06% Senior notes due 10/1/2013$ $300.0 $ $ $ $ $300.0 $314.9Interest expense8.5 4.3 12.8 Interest rate2.85% 2.85% Senior notes due 9/15/2014$ $ $400.0 $ $ $ $400.0 $429.5Interest expense18.0 18.0 8.3 44.3 Interest rate4.50% 4.50% 4.50% Senior notes due 10/1/2015$ $ $ $250.0 $ $ $250.0 $260.3Interest expense8.1 8.1 8.1 4.1 28.4 Interest rate3.25% 3.25% 3.25% 3.25% Senior notes due 6/15/2016$ $ $ $ $250.0 $ $250.0 $257.8Interest expense7.4 7.4 7.4 7.4 1.4 31.0 Interest rate2.95% 2.95% 2.95% 2.95% 2.95% Senior subordinated notes due 10/1/2018$ $ $ $ $ $215.4 $215.4 $234.8Interest expense15.4 15.4 15.4 15.4 15.4 22.7 99.7 Interest rate7.13% 7.13% 7.13% 7.13% 7.13% 7.13% 43Table of Contents(In millions)3/31/2013 3/31/2014 3/31/2015 3/31/2016 3/31/2017 Thereafter Total Fair ValueVariable Rate Debt: Commercial Paper$388.5 $ $ $ $ $ $388.5 $388.5Interest expense0.2 0.2 Interest rate0.54% Revolving credit borrowings Multi currency$ $ $ $ $43.5 $ $43.5 $43.5Interest expense0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.1 3.7 Interest rate (a)1.93% 1.93% 1.93% 1.93% 1.93% Revolving credit borrowings France$6.3 $ $ $ $ $ $6.3 $6.3Interest expense0.1 0.1 Interest rate (b)1.70% Trade receivables securitization$ $295.0 $ $ $ $ $295.0 $295.0Interest expense3.0 2.2 5.2 Interest rate1.01% 1.01% Interest Rate Swaps: 5 swaps receive fixed/pay variable Notional amounts$ $300.0 $ $ $ $ $300.0 $(6.7)Swap (receipts) (6.7) (6.7) Variable forward pay rate 1.35% Weighted average receive rate 2.85% (a) The interest rate on the revolving credit facilities is the weighted average of the variable interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolving credit line (which had no borrowings at March 31, 2012) and the multi currency revolving credit line. The variable interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolving credit line are based on a spread over LIBOR applicable to each tranche under the U.S. credit line. The average of the variable interest rates on the multi currency portions of the Credit Facility is based on a spread over the Euro currency rate applicable to each foreign currency borrowing under the multi currency credit line. (b) The variable interest rates on the French revolving credit borrowings are based on a spread over the Euro currency rate.Limitations of the Tabular PresentationAs the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March 31, 2012, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Companys credit rating.Foreign Currency Rate RiskCanadian subsidiaries and the European operations of the Company are funded in part with local currency debt. The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its financial position and results of operations.
