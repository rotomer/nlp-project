ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI) uses innovative technologies to produce a wide range of specialty materials for global markets. Our specialty materials are produced in a variety of alloys and forms, and are selected for use in environments that demand materials having exceptional hardness, toughness, strength, resistance to heat, corrosion or abrasion, or a combination of these characteristics. Major end markets of our products include aerospace, construction and mining, chemical processing, oil and gas, automotive, electrical energy, food processing equipment and appliances, machine and cutting tools, transportation, medical, and defense industries. Unless the context requires otherwise, "ATI," "we," "our," "us" and similar terms refer to Allegheny Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries. Certain statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements. Actual results or performance could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described below. OVERVIEW 2004 was a year of transition and transformation for ATI. After incurring losses over the previous three years and the first quarter of 2004, we generated profits for each of the last three quarters of 2004, and a profit for the full 2004 year of $19.8 million, or $0.22 per share. Sales increased 41% to $2.73 billion for 2004 as higher base selling prices, the effect of raw material surcharges, and higher shipments for most of our major products resulted from improved business conditions in most of the major markets we serve. Demand for our stainless steel flat rolled products increased for 2004 due to the improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, especially in most capital goods markets. This improvement in demand and higher base prices for most of the products of our Flat Rolled Products segment, along with our acquisition of certain manufacturing assets of J&L Specialty Steel LLC ("J&L") in mid 2004, and the benefits of cost reductions, offset the negative effects of rapidly rising raw material costs on our last in, first out ("LIFO") inventory accounting methodology and higher energy costs, resulting in an operating profit for this segment of $61.5 million for 2004 compared to an operating loss of $14.1 million in 2003. Sales for our High Performance Metals segment improved 24% primarily due to improving demand from the aerospace and medical markets for our nickel based alloys and superalloys and titanium alloys, and continued strong demand for our exotic materials, especially from the government and chemical processing markets. Operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment improved 224% to $84.8 million, due primarily to the improved pricing and increased shipments resulting from the increase in demand and the benefits from our cost reduction efforts, partially offset by the impact on our LIFO inventory accounting methodology from rising raw material costs. Results for our Engineered Products segment also improved, as sales increased 17% and operating profit increased 168% to $20.8 million due to improved demand from the oil and gas, construction and transportation markets, plus the benefits from our cost reduction actions. While segment profitability improved significantly in 2004, operating results were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs which resulted in LIFO inventory valuation reserve charges of $112.2 million, and higher energy costs of $6.2 million, which partially offset the benefits of $142 million in cost reductions and $14.6 million of lower retirement benefit expense. Retirement benefit expenses decreased in 2004 to $119.8 million primarily as a result of higher than expected returns on pension assets during 2003, and actions taken in the second quarter 2004 to control retiree medical costs, partially offset by the use of a lower discount rate assumption for determining benefit plan liabilities. During 2004, our goals were to return our stainless steel business to profitability, and to continue to focus on enhancing our leading market positions, reducing costs, and improving our balance sheet. We were successful in each of these areas. Our accomplishments during 2004 from these important efforts included: o In June 2004, we acquired substantially all of the stainless steel manufacturing assets of J&L Specialty Steel LLC for $67 million, which represented the cost of this business net working capital, including the assumption of certain current liabilities, and which is subject to final adjustment. The acquisition was completed for a $7.5 million cash payment at closing with the balance financed by the seller. These facilities were successfully integrated into our Allegheny Ludlum operations in the second half of 2004. In connection with the acquisition, a new progressive labor agreement was negotiated with United Steelworkers of America ("USWA"), which represents employees at our Allegheny Ludlum operations and at the acquired operations. The new progressive labor agreement significantly improves the productivity and cost structure of our flat rolled products business. 12 o We achieved $142 million in gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, exceeding our 2004 goal of $104 million. A significant portion of these cost reductions resulted from our continuing efforts to streamline processes and improve productivity. o We completed two major strategic capital investments, both of which began in 2002. The second of two new electric arc furnaces for our flat rolled products melt shop located in Brackenridge, PA began operation in September 2004 with the first furnace having begun operation in November 2003. The second project was a major upgrade and expansion of our High Performance Metals long products rolling mill facility located in Richburg, SC, which began production in mid 2004. We believe these projects provide state of the art operating capabilities, increased efficiencies, lower operating costs, and expanded capacity. o We realized continued success in implementing the ATI Business System, which is driving lean manufacturing throughout our operations. In addition to the gross cost reductions discussed above and the improved safety performance discussed below, another result of our ATI Business System efforts was a significant improvement in managed working capital. We define managed working capital as accounts receivable and gross inventories less accounts payable. At December 31, 2004, managed working capital was 29.5% of annualized sales compared to 30.7% and 32.4% of annualized sales at 2003 and 2002 year ends, respectively. o We continued to realize significant improvement in safety. As a result of our continuing focus on and commitment to safety, in 2004, our OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate improved by 33% and our Lost Time Case Rate improved by 36%, both compared to 2002. o We have strengthened our balance sheet. In addition to returning ATI to profitability in 2004, in July 2004 we completed the sale of 13.8 million shares of our common stock in a public offering and received $229.7 million in net proceeds. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to enhance our abilities to make growth oriented investments, including capital investments and acquisitions that we believe will offer attractive returns. We also intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our outstanding liabilities, which may include making voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit trust or the repayment or repurchase of our long term debt securities. In September 2004, we executed a portion of our strategy by making a voluntary contribution of $50 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. o We reduced our other postretirement benefit liability by approximately $331 million, or 36%, as a result efforts to control costs by capping ATIs share of retiree medical costs and by capping and eventually eliminating these benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees. As a result of these accomplishments, we believe that ATI should benefit from improving business conditions in 2005. As we begin the year, most of our end markets remain strong and we expect 2005 to be a year of revenue growth and accelerating profitability. Sales are expected to grow in 2005, compared to 2004, due to the full year impact of significantly improved prices and higher volumes, especially in our Flat Rolled Products and High Performance Metals segments. We remain encouraged by the aerospace market build forecasts in terms of both the number and size of aircraft, as well as increased high performance metal content. We expect a full year of benefits in 2005 from the strategic assets added in 2004, principally the stainless steel melt shop and finishing operations in Midland, PA and Louisville, OH acquired in June 2004, the upgraded Brackenridge, PA stainless steel melt shop completed in September 2004, and the expanded high performance metals long products rolling mill in Richburg, SC, which began production in mid 2004. For 2005, capital expenditures are expected to be between $85 and $100 million. We are committed to improving operating performance through the ATI Business System. We have established a 2005 cost reduction goal of approximately $100 million, before the effects of inflation. We also expect to continue to benefit from synergies and cost reductions from the J&L asset acquisition and the new labor agreement in our flat rolled products business. Finally, retirement benefit expense is projected to be approximately $33 million lower in 2005 than in 2004, primarily as a result of actions taken in 2004 to control retiree medical costs. ACQUISITION OF J&L SPECIALTY STEEL LLC ASSETS On June 1, 2004, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of J&L Specialty Steel LLC, a producer of flat rolled stainless steel products with operations in Midland, Pennsylvania and Louisville, Ohio, for $67.0 million in total consideration, including the assumption of certain current liabilities. The purchase price included $7.5 million cash paid at closing, the issuance to the seller of a non interest bearing $7.5 million promissory note payable on June 1, 2005, and the issuance to the seller of a promissory note in the principal amount of $52.0 million, which is subject to final adjustment, and 13 secured by the property, plant and equipment acquired, payable in installments in 2007 through 2011, which bears interest at a London Inter bank Offered Rate plus a 1% margin, with a maximum interest rate of 6%. In connection with the J&L asset acquisition, we reached a new labor agreement with the USWA, which represents employees at Allegheny Ludlum and at the former J&L facilities. The new agreement provides for a workforce restructuring through which we expect to achieve significant productivity improvements. Through a reduction in the number of job classifications and the implementation of flexible work rules, employees are being given broader responsibilities and the opportunity to become more involved in the business. The number of production and maintenance employees at the pre acquisition Allegheny Ludlum facilities is being reduced by 650 employees, or approximately 25%, through an early retirement program over two and a half years pursuant to which the employees are being offered transition incentives. Approximately 40% of these retirements occurred in second half of 2004, with over 70% of these retirements to be effective by the end of 2005, and 100% of these retirements to be effective by June 2006. With the addition of the J&L assets, we estimate that our Allegheny Ludlum operations will be capable of annual shipments in excess of 700,000 tons of flat rolled specialty metals with approximately 2,650 production and maintenance employees. By comparison, Allegheny Ludlum shipped 478,000 tons of these metals in 2003 with over 3,000 production and maintenance employees. The acquisition of the J&L assets and the negotiation of the new progressive labor agreement with the USWA are expected to improve the performance of our Allegheny Ludlum business. We expect the new labor agreement, combined with the integration of the former J&L operations, to generate annual cost structure improvements relative to the combined performance of the former J&L and pre acquisition Allegheny Ludlum operations of approximately $200 million when workforce restructuring and synergies are fully implemented in the second half of 2006. We anticipate these cost structure improvements to come from reduced labor costs, operating synergies, improved product mix, and reduced fixed costs. In the aggregate, we expect these initiatives to result in a competitive cost structure for our flat rolled stainless steel business. During the second half of 2004, the former J&L operations were successfully integrated into Allegheny Ludlum with the improvement in cost structure realized to date reflected in our operating results. Going forward the cost savings associated with the former J&L operations that have yet to be realized, such as further reductions in labor costs associated with the contractual reduction in the size of the workforce and additional operating and procurement synergies, will be included as part of our continuing overall cost reduction programs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Sales were $2.73 billion in 2004, $1.94 billion in 2003 and $1.91 billion in 2002. International sales represented approximately 20% of 2004 total sales and 23% of total sales for each of 2003 and 2002. Operating profit was $167.1 million in 2004, $19.9 million in 2003, and $27.3 million in 2002. Our measure of operating profit, which we use to analyze the performance and results of our business segments, excludes income taxes, corporate expenses, net interest expense, curtailment gain, management transition and restructuring costs, other costs net of gains on asset sales, and retirement benefit expense. We believe operating profit, as defined, provides an appropriate measure of controllable operating results at the business segment level. Income before tax was $19.8 million in 2004 compared to loss before tax of $280.2 million and $103.8 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income before income tax for 2004 included a curtailment gain, net of restructuring charges, of $40.4 million. Loss before tax included restructuring charges and litigation expense of $84.9 million in 2003, and restructuring charges of $42.8 million in 2002. A severe decline in the equity markets in 2000 through 2002 and lower discount rate assumptions for determining benefit plan liabilities resulted in retirement benefit expenses of $119.8 million in 2004, $134.4 million in 2003 and $21.8 million for 2002. Net income was $19.8 million for 2004 compared to losses, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, of $313.3 million and $65.8 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Results for 2004 do not include an income tax provision or benefit for current or deferred taxes primarily as a result of the continuing uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax assets and available operating loss carryforwards. Net income for 2004 included a curtailment gain, net of restructuring costs of $40.4 million, related to the elimination of retiree medical benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees beginning in 2010, and costs associated with the acquisition of the J&L assets and the new labor agreement. The net loss for 2003 included a $138.5 million charge for a valuation allowance on the majority of our 14 net deferred tax assets, pretax restructuring charges of $62.4 million relating to asset impairments in the Flat Rolled Products segment and workforce reductions across all operating segments and the corporate office, and $22.5 million for litigation expense. As a result of recording the deferred tax valuation allowance, results for 2003 include an income tax provision of $33.1 million, whereas 2002 pretax losses were reduced by income tax benefits of $38.0 million. Results for 2002 included charges of $42.8 million related to the indefinite idling of our Massillon, OH stainless steel plate facility in the Flat Rolled Products segment, and workforce reductions. We operate in three business segments: Flat Rolled Products, High Performance Metals and Engineered Products. These segments represented the following percentages of our total revenues for the years indicated: 2004 2003 2002 Flat Rolled Products 60% 54% 55% High Performance Metals 29% 33% 33% Engineered Products 11% 13% 12% Information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FLAT ROLLED PRODUCTS (In millions) 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Sales to external customers $ 1,643.9 58% $ 1,043.5 0% $ 1,040.3 Operating income (loss) 61.5 n/m (14.1) (64)% (8.6) Operating income (loss) as a percentage of sales 3.7% (1.4%) (0.8%) International sales as a percentage of sales 12.9% 13.5% 11.8% n/m: Not meaningful Our Flat Rolled Products segment produces, converts and distributes stainless steel, nickel based alloys, and titanium and titanium based alloys, in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, strip, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip(R) products, as well as silicon electrical steel sheet, and tool steels. The major end markets for our flat rolled products are construction and mining, automotive, electrical energy, food processing equipment and appliances, machine and cutting tools, chemical processing, oil and gas, electronics, communication equipment and computers. The operations in this segment are Allegheny Ludlum, our 60% interest in the Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), and our 50% interest in the industrial titanium joint venture known as Uniti LLC. The remaining 40% interest in STAL is owned by the Baosteel Group, a state authorized investment company whose equity securities are publicly traded in the Peoples Republic of China. The financial results of STAL are consolidated into the segments operating results with the 40% interest of our minority partner recognized in the statement of operations as other income or expense. The remaining 50% interest in Uniti LLC is held by VSMPO AVISMA, a Russian producer of titanium, aluminum, and specialty steel products. We account for the results of the Uniti joint venture using the equity method since we do not have a controlling interest. On June 1, 2004, we acquired substantially all of the assets of J&L Specialty Steel LLC, including facilities located in Midland, PA and Louisville, OH. Operating results include the acquired J&L operations from the date of acquisition. However since the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, 2004 results did not include any operating profit on sales of the approximately $56 million of the J&L inventory on hand at the acquisition date. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2004 were $1,643.9 million, or 58% higher than 2003, which was due primarily to improved demand, higher base selling prices, higher raw material surcharges, and higher shipments resulting from the Midland, PA and Louisville, OH facilities acquired in June 2004. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was: 15 For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % Change Volume (finished tons): Total Flat Rolled Products 587,753 478,353 23% Commodity 422,944 342,689 23% High value 164,809 135,664 21% Average Prices (per finished ton): Total Flat Rolled Products $ 2,793 $ 2,179 28% Commodity 2,195 1,582 39% High value 4,328 3,687 17% Finished tons shipped in 2004 increased by 23% to 587,753 tons compared to shipments of 478,353 tons for 2003. The average transaction prices to customers, which includes the effect of higher raw material surcharges and higher base selling prices, increased by 28% to $2,793 per ton in 2004. Shipments of commodity products (including stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, stainless steel plate and silicon electrical steel, among other products) increased 23% and average transaction prices for these products increased 39%. The increase in shipments was primarily attributable to improving demand from the residential construction and remodeling markets, and capital goods markets such as chemical processing, oil and gas, and power generation markets, and the benefit of additional capacity resulting from the Midland, PA and Louisville, OH facilities acquired in June 2004. Demand remained good from the automotive and appliance markets. The increase in average transaction prices was primarily due to higher base selling prices and higher raw material surcharges. The majority of our stainless steel products are sold at prices that include surcharges for raw materials such as iron, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum, including purchased scrap, which are required to manufacture our products.

In addition, a raw material surcharge for iron scrap was instituted in the first half of 2004 as a result of the cost of iron scrap increasing approximately 70% in 2004 compared to average cost for 2003. The average base selling price in December 2004 for Type 304 commodity stainless steel cold rolled sheet increased approximately 28% compared to the same period 2003. In 2004, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products increased approximately 15%, compared to 2003 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). Our high value product shipments in the segment (including strip, Precision Rolled Strip, super stainless steel, nickel alloy and titanium products) increased 21%, and average transaction prices for high value products increased 17%. Certain of these high value products are used in the consumer durables and capital goods markets, both of which benefited from an improving U.S. economy in the markets we serve, which positively affected shipments and base selling prices. In addition, shipments of Precision Rolled Strip products increased in Europe and Asia due primarily to strong demand from the automotive and electronics markets, partially aided by the weaker U.S. currency. 16 [BAR CHART] 99 00 01 02 03 04 Apparent Domestic Consumption Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip (Millions of tons) 1.90 1.90 1.55 1.60 1.57 1.80 (Source: SSINA) As a result of the improving business conditions, operating income increased to $61.5 million for 2004 compared to an operating loss of $14.1 million in the 2003 period. The benefits of increased shipment volumes, higher base selling prices, and cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. During 2004 the average cost of our raw materials in our Flat Rolled products segment increased approximately 50%. For 2004, we incurred approximately $94 million of expense for these cost increases, including LIFO inventory charges of $86.5 million and cost increases of $7.5 million for certain raw materials which were not subject to surcharges for the full year. In addition, natural gas and electricity costs for 2004 were approximately $5 million higher than 2003. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our operations. In 2004, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of $80 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, included $26 million from operating efficiencies, $28 million from procurement, $24 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses, and $2 million from other fixed cost savings. During the second half of 2004, we began reducing our hourly workforce at our Allegheny Ludlum plants by 650 employees, which represented approximately 25% of the pre J&L acquisition hourly workforce, in accordance with the new labor agreement with the USWA. This agreement resulted in a pension termination benefits charge of $25.3 million in the second quarter 2004. Under this agreement, 267 hourly employees retired in 2004 with 383 employees contractually scheduled to retire in 2005 through the first half of 2006. The pension termination benefits charge is presented in restructuring costs on the statement of operations and is not included in the results for the segment. We continued to invest to enhance our flat rolled specialty metals capabilities, increase efficiencies and reduce costs. Our strategic capital investment to upgrade the Brackenridge, PA melt shop, which commenced in 2002 and cost approximately $40 million, was successfully completed. The first of the two new electric arc furnaces began operation in November 2003 and the second furnace began operation in September 2004. Cost savings from this capital investment are estimated to be over $20 million annually. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2003 were $1,043.5 million, essentially the same as 2002, which was due primarily to the effect of higher raw material surcharges offsetting lower volumes and reduced base selling prices. Weak demand and base pricing for products of the Flat Rolled Products segment, especially commodity stainless steel, which persisted for most of 2003, plus the negative effects of rapidly rising raw material costs and higher energy costs resulted in an operating loss of $14.1 million for 2003 compared to an operating loss of $8.6 million in 2002. Finished tons shipped in 2003 declined by 2% to 478,353 tons compared to shipments of 487,335 tons for 2002. The average transaction prices to customers increased by 2% to $2,179 per ton in 2003 due primarily to higher raw materials surcharges, which offset a 4% decline in average base selling prices, which exclude the effect of surcharges. Shipments of commodity products (including stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, stainless steel plate and silicon electrical steel, among other products) decreased 2% while average prices for these products increased 3%. The decline in shipments was primarily attributable to continued depressed demand for commodity stainless steel sheet and plate due to the continued weakness in the U.S. industrial economy, especially in the non residential construction and most capital goods markets. The increase in average transaction prices was primarily due to higher raw material surcharges, principally for nickel and nickel bearing scrap. Commodity stainless steel base selling prices, which exclude surcharges, declined 4% in 2003 compared to 2002. During the same period, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products was flat according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). High value product shipments in the segment (including strip, Precision Rolled Strip(R), super stainless steel, nickel alloy and titanium products) decreased 1%, while average transaction prices for high value products were flat. Increased shipments of Precision Rolled Strip(R) products in Europe and Asia were partially offset by the overall decline in shipments of other high value products. Certain of these high value products are used in the consumer durables and capital goods markets, both of which continued to be impacted by the weak U.S. economy in the markets we serve, which negatively affected shipments. Operating results for 2003 were adversely affected by higher raw material costs, which increased significantly in 2003, especially during the second half of the year. For example, the cost of nickel, a major raw material in the production of many stainless steel alloys, increased 97% in 2003 from an average cost of $3.26 per pound for the month of December 2002 to an average cost of $6.43 per pound for December 2003, as priced on the London Metals Exchange. While we were able to offset a significant portion of the increase through raw material surcharges in the pricing of our products, these higher costs had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our LIFO inventory accounting methodology. For 2003, we incurred approximately $36 million of expense for these cost increases, including LIFO inventory charges of $27 million and cost increases of $9 million for certain raw materials which were not subject to our surcharges. In addition, natural gas and electricity costs for 2003 were approximately $12 million higher than 2002. 17 In 2003, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of $60 million. Major areas of cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, included $19 million from operating efficiencies, $18 million from procurement, $13 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses, and $10 million from reduced depreciation expense and other fixed cost savings. During 2003, we implemented workforce reductions of approximately 140 salaried employees representing approximately 13% of the salaried workforce. These workforce reductions were substantially complete by the end of 2003 and resulted in a pretax severance charge of $5 million in 2003. In addition, we indefinitely idled our Washington Flat Rolled coil facility located in Washington, PA and recorded an asset impairment charge related to the remaining assets located at Houston, PA reflecting projected utilization. These actions resulted in a total pretax, non cash asset impairment charge of $47.5 million in the 2003 fourth quarter. These expenses are presented as restructuring costs on the statement of operations and are not included in the results for the segment. From 2000 to 2003, the salaried workforce was reduced by approximately 41%. HIGH PERFORMANCE METALS (In millions) 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Sales to external customers $ 794.1 24% $ 641.7 2% $ 630.0 Operating profit 84.8 224% 26.2 (16%) 31.2 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 10.7% 4.1% 5.0% International sales as a percentage of sales 32.5% 34.8% 39.3% Our High Performance Metals segment produces, converts and distributes a wide range of high performance alloys, including nickel and cobalt based alloys and superalloys, titanium and titanium based alloys, exotic alloys such as zirconium, hafnium, niobium, nickel titanium, tantalum, and their related alloys, and other specialty materials, primarily in long product forms such as ingot, billet, bar, rod, wire, and seamless tube. The operations in this segment are Allvac, Allvac Ltd (U.K.) and Wah Chang. These products are designed for the high performance requirements of such major markets as aerospace jet engines and airframes, chemical processing, oil and gas, medical, energy generation, defense, transportation, nuclear power, marine, and high energy physics markets. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment increased 24% to $794.1 million in 2004 primarily due to improved demand from commercial aerospace, biomedical, defense, chemical processing, and oil and gas markets. Our exotic alloys business continued to benefit from sustained demand from government and medical markets, and from corrosion markets particularly in Asia. Operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment improved significantly to $84.8 million as a result of increased shipments for most of our products, higher selling prices, and the benefits of cost reductions. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): Nickel based and specialty steel alloys 34,353 35,168 (2%) Titanium mill products 22,012 18,436 19% Exotic alloys 4,318 4,245 2% Average Prices (per lb.): Nickel based and specialty steel alloys $ 8.60 $ 6.57 31% Titanium mill products 12.34 11.50 7% Exotic alloys 40.95 37.64 9% Shipments of nickel based and specialty steel alloys decreased 2% due primarily to product mix, while average prices increased 31%. Titanium mill products shipments increased 19% and average prices increased 7%. Shipments for exotic alloys increased 2% and average prices increased 9%. Backlog of confirmed orders for the segment increased 41% to approximately $380 million at December 31, 2004, compared to approximately $270 million at December 31, 2003. Operating profit for 2004 and 2003 was adversely affected by higher raw material costs, which increased significantly in the past two years. These higher costs had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our LIFO inventory accounting methodology, resulting in $16.2 million of expense for 2004, compared to $11.7 million of LIFO expense in 2003. 18 We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2004. Gross cost reductions for 2004, before the effects of inflation, totaled approximately $48 million. Major areas of cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, included $21 million from operating efficiencies, $13 million from procurement, and $14 million from salaried and hourly labor cost savings. We continued to invest to enhance our specialty metals capabilities, increase efficiencies and reduce costs. Our strategic capital investment to enhance the capabilities of our long products rolling mill facility located in Richburg, SC, which cost approximately $48 million, began construction in 2002 and commenced production in the second quarter of 2004. The project includes mutual conversion agreements with Outokumpu Oyjs U.S. subsidiary, Outokumpu Stainless, giving us access to process our products at Outokumpu Stainless facility and Outokumpu Stainless access to process their stainless steel long products at our Richburg facility. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment increased 2% to $641.7 million in 2003 primarily due to strong demand for our exotic materials, especially for the government and chemical processing markets, which offset continued weakness in the commercial aerospace and land based turbine power generation markets. However, operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment declined 16% to $26.2 million because of lower demand and prices for nickel based alloys and superalloys, specialty steel alloys and titanium based alloys, which represent approximately 70% of the segments sales. In addition, rising raw material costs offset cost reduction efforts. Shipments of nickel based and specialty steel alloys decreased 2%, while average prices increased 3% due primarily to product mix. Titanium mill products shipments decreased 3% and average prices decreased 3%. Shipments for exotic alloys increased 14% and average prices increased 4%. Backlog of confirmed orders for the segment was approximately $270 million at December 31, 2003, compared to approximately $300 million at December 31, 2002. Operating profit for 2003 was adversely affected by higher raw material costs, which increased significantly in 2003, especially during the second half of the year. These higher costs had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our LIFO inventory accounting methodology, resulting in $11.7 million of expense for 2003, compared to $7.4 million of LIFO income in 2002. Operating profit in 2002 was adversely impacted by the effects of a seven month labor strike settled in March 2002 at our Wah Chang operation, which produces our exotic alloys. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, for 2003 totaled approximately $45 million. Major areas of cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, included $23 million from operating efficiencies, $13 million from procurement, and $9 million from hourly and salary labor cost savings. During 2003, we implemented further workforce reductions, which affected approximately 200 employees, or 19% of the salaried workforce. In connection with these reductions, which were substantially completed by the end of the year, we recorded charges of $3 million for the related severance costs. These expenses are presented as restructuring costs on the statement of operations and are not included in the results for the segment. ENGINEERED PRODUCTS (In millions) 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Sales to external customers $ 295.0 17% $ 252.2 6% $ 237.5 Operating profit 20.8 168% 7.8 66% 4.7 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 7.1% 3.1% 2.0% International sales as a percentage of sales 28.9% 31.0% 29.5% Our Engineered Products segment includes the production of tungsten powder, tungsten heavy alloys, tungsten carbide materials and carbide cutting tools. The segment also produces carbon alloy steel impression die forgings, and large grey and ductile iron castings, and provides precision metals processing services. The operations in this segment are Metalworking Products, Portland Forge, Casting Service and Rome Metals. The major markets served by our products of the Engineered Products Segment include a wide variety of industrial markets including automotive, chemical processing, oil and gas, machine and cutting tools, construction and mining, aerospace, transportation, and wind power generation. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Sales for the Engineered Products segment in 2004 increased 17%, to $295.0 million and operating profit increased 168%, to $20.8 million compared to 2003. Demand for our tungsten products was strong from general manufacturing, and the oil and gas and medical markets. Demand improved for forgings from the Class 8 truck, and construction and mining markets. Demand for castings was strong from the transportation and wind energy markets. The improvement in segment operating profit was primarily due to higher sales volumes, improved pricing, and the impact of cost reductions, which totaled $9 million in 2004. The improvement in profitability was partially offset by higher raw material costs, which resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $9.5 million in 2004, compared to a charge of $1.9 million in 2003. 19 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Sales for the Engineered Products segment increased 6%, to $252.2 million in 2003, compared to 2002, and operating profit increased 66%, to $7.8 million. Demand for our tungsten products from the oil and gas, medical and automotive markets improved during 2003. Demand also improved for forgings and castings. Segment operating profit improved primarily due to higher sales and the impact of cost reductions, which totaled $9 million in 2003. In the second half of 2003, we announced an additional restructuring of the European operations of Metalworking Products. Restructuring charges of approximately $3 million associated with this consolidation are presented as restructuring costs on the 2003 statement of operations and are not included in segment results. CORPORATE EXPENSES Corporate expenses were $34.9 million in 2004 compared to $20.5 million in 2003, and $20.6 million in 2002. Cost controls and reductions in the number of corporate employees that were implemented over this period were offset in 2004 by increased compensation expense and the costs of complying with Sarbanes Oxley regulations. A significant portion of the increase in compensation expense is non cash and is associated with our long term, performance based stock compensation plans. Achievement under these plans is marked to market for stock price changes, which resulted in substantially higher expense in 2004 due to the significant increase in our stock price during the year, and our stock performance relative to a group of our industry peers. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net of interest income, was $35.5 million for 2004 compared to $27.7 million for 2003 and $34.3 million for 2002. The effect of "receive fixed, pay floating" interest rate swap contracts of $150 million, related to our $300 million, 8.375% 10 year Notes issued in December 2001, decreased interest expense by $4.4 million in 2004, $6.7 million in 2003 and $4.9 million in 2002, compared to the fixed interest expense of the Notes. These swap agreements were terminated in the third quarter 2004. Interest expense in 2004 and 2003 was reduced by $0.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively, related to interest capitalization on capital projects. Interest expense is presented net of interest income of $2.9 million for 2004, $6.2 million for 2003 and $3.0 million for 2002. The increase in interest income for 2003 primarily relates to interest on settlements of prior years tax liabilities. CURTAILMENT GAIN AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS We recorded a curtailment gain, net of restructuring costs, of $40.4 million in 2004 and restructuring costs of $62.4 million, and $42.8 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, the curtailment gain, net of restructuring costs, of $40.4 million, includes the $71.5 million curtailment and settlement gain and the $25.3 million pension termination benefit charge discussed in Retirement Benefit Expense, below, and $5.8 million of restructuring charges. The restructuring charges related to the new labor agreement at our Allegheny Ludlum operations, and the J&L asset acquisition, and included labor agreement costs of $4.6 million, severance costs of $0.7 million related to approximately 30 salaried employees, and $0.5 million for asset impairment charges for redundant equipment following the J&L asset acquisition. In 2003, we recorded restructuring charges of $62.4 million, including $47.5 million for impairment of long lived assets in the Flat Rolled Products segment, $11.1 million for workforce reductions across all business segments and the corporate office, and $3.8 million for facility closure charges including present valued lease termination costs, net of forecasted sublease rental income, at the corporate office. In the 2003 fourth quarter, based on existing and projected operating levels at our remaining operations in Houston, PA, and at our Washington Flat Roll coil facility located in Washington, PA, we determined that the net book values of these facilities were in excess of their estimated fair market values based on expected future cash flows. Charges for the Houston facility and the Washington Flat Roll coil facility were recorded to write down the net book values of these facilities to their estimated fair market values. These asset impairment charges did not impact current operations at these facilities. The workforce reductions affected approximately 375 employees across all segments and the corporate office. Approximately $5 million of the severance charges was paid from the Companys pension plan, and at December 31, 2004, approximately $5 million of the workforce reduction and facility closure charges are future cash costs that will be paid over the next nine years. Cash to meet these obligations is expected to be generated from one or more of the following sources: internally generated funds from operations, current cash on hand, or borrowings under existing credit lines. In 2002, we recorded total charges of $42.8 million related to the indefinite idling of our Massillon, OH stainless steel plate facility due to continuing poor demand for wide continuous mill plate products, and further workforce reductions across all of our operations. The Massillon, OH stainless steel plate facility was indefinitely idled in the 2002 fourth quarter, and 20 resulted in a pretax non cash asset impairment charge of $34.4 million, representing the excess of the book value of the facility over its estimated fair market value. In addition, during the second half of 2002, and in light of the continued weak demand in the markets we serve, we announced workforce reductions of approximately 665 employees. These workforce reductions were substantially complete by the end of the first half of 2003, and resulted in a pretax, primarily cash, severance charge of $8.4 million, net of a retirement benefits curtailment gain. These expenses were presented as restructuring costs on the statement of operations and were not included in segment results. Of the $42.8 million restructuring charge recorded in 2002, $8.4 million resulted in expenditures of cash. OTHER EXPENSES, NET OF GAINS ON ASSET SALES Other expenses, net of gains on asset sales, includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations, pretax gains and losses on the sale of surplus real estate, non strategic investments and other assets, operating results from equity method investees, minority interest and other non operating income or expense. These items are presented primarily in selling and administrative expenses, and in other income (expense) in the statement of operations and resulted in other income of $2.5 million in 2004, and net charges of $47.7 million and $11.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, charges for closed companies related to legal, environmental, insurance and other matters were approximately $30 million higher than in 2002. These charges include $22.5 million related to litigation with the San Diego Unified Port District, as more fully described in Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and which is included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations; and changes in our estimates of our liability for environmental closure costs and for liabilities under retrospectively rated insurance programs. In 2002, we recognized a pretax charge of $6.5 million for our approximate 30% share of the net losses in New Piper Aircraft ("New Piper"), and for the write off of the carrying value of this investment. RETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE Retirement benefit expenses, which primarily include pension and postretirement medical benefits, declined $14.6 million in 2004 primarily as a result of higher than expected returns on pension assets during 2003, and actions taken in the second quarter 2004 to control retiree medical costs, partially offset by the use of a lower discount rate assumption for determining benefit plan liabilities. Retirement benefit expense had increased significantly over the previous three years principally due to lower pension investments as a result of severe declines in the equity markets in 2000 through 2002, and higher benefit liabilities from long term labor contracts negotiated in 2001. Retirement benefit expense, excluding the effect of curtailment gains and termination benefit charges, was $119.8 million for 2004, $134.4 million for 2003 and $21.8 million for 2002. Retirement benefit expenses have adversely affected both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses. Retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Cost of sales $ (88.4) $ (94.6) $ (9.9) Selling and administrative expenses (31.4) (39.8) (11.9) Total retirement benefit expense $ (119.8) $ (134.4) $ (21.8) The 2004 retirement benefit expense discussed above does not include the effects of the $71.5 million curtailment and settlement gain related to the elimination of retiree medical benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees beginning in 2010, nor does this expense include the $25.3 million charge related to the Transition Assistance Program ("TAP") incentives associated with the new labor agreement at Allegheny Ludlum, which will be paid from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Additionally, the retirement benefit expense recognized through December 31, 2004 includes approximately $2 million of the expected $46 million favorable impact on our postretirement medical expense from the enactment of the Federal Medicare prescription drug benefit program in December 2003. The reduction in postretirement expense from this program will be recognized over a number of years. Retirement benefit expenses for 2005 are expected to be approximately $87 million, with effects on cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses similar to the percentages in 2004. The pension expense component is expected to decline to approximately $63 million pretax for 2005 from $74 million for 2004 as actual returns on pension assets in 2004 were higher than expected, partially offset by a lower assumed discount rate to value pension benefit liabilities. The postretirement medical expense component is expected to decline to approximately $24 million for 2005 from $46 million for 2004 primarily as a result of actions taken in the 2004 second quarter to control certain retiree medical costs partially offset by a lower assumed discount rate to value benefit liabilities. 21 INCOME TAXES Results of operations for 2004 do not include an income tax provision or benefit for current or deferred taxes primarily as a result of the continuing uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax asset and available operating loss carryforwards. In the 2003 fourth quarter we recorded a $138.5 million valuation allowance for the majority of our net deferred tax asset, based upon the results of our quarterly evaluation concerning the estimated probability that the net deferred tax asset would be realizable in light of our recent history of annual reported losses. This charge did not affect cash and does not affect our ability to utilize any of our deferred tax assets on future tax returns. Our income tax provision (benefit) for 2003 and 2002 was $33.1 million and $(38.0) million, respectively. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received $7.2 million, $65.6 million and $45.6 million, respectively, in income tax refunds related to carrying back the previous years taxable loss to earlier years in which we had paid taxes. Under current tax laws we are substantially unable to carryback any current year or future tax losses to prior periods to obtain cash refunds of taxes paid during those periods. Current year federal tax losses, if any, can be carried forward for up to 20 years and applied against taxes owed in those future years. As of December 31, 2004, we had a U.S. Federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately $140 million, which equates to a U.S. Federal tax benefit of approximately $50 million. This carryforward is available to offset any taxable income in 2005, or in future periods through 2024. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. At December 31, 2004, we had a net deferred tax asset of $53.0 million, net of a valuation allowance of $188.9 million. A significant portion of our deferred tax assets, prior to the valuation allowance, relates to postretirement employee benefit obligations, which have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements but which are not recognized for income tax reporting purposes until the benefits are paid. These benefit payments are expected to occur over an extended period of years. No valuation allowance was required on $53.0 million of net deferred tax assets based upon our ability to utilize these assets within the carryback, carryforward period, including consideration of tax planning strategies that we would undertake to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unutilized. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset until a realization event occurs to support the reversal of all or a portion of the reserve. As a result, future tax provisions or benefits are expected to be recognized only when taxable income exceeds net operating loss carryforwards resulting in cash tax payments, or when tax losses are recoverable as cash refunds. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe that internally generated funds, current cash on hand and available borrowings under existing secured credit lines will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs. We did not borrow funds under our domestic secured credit facility during 2004 or 2003. However, a portion of this secured credit facility is utilized to support letters of credit. Our ability to access the credit markets in the future to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be influenced by our credit rating. As of December 31, 2004, Standard & Poors Ratings Services corporate credit rating for our Company was BB with a stable outlook and our senior unsecured debt was rated B+. As of December 31, 2004, Moodys Investor Services senior implied rating for our Company was B1 with a stable outlook, and senior unsecured rating was B3. Changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to, or cost of, our existing credit facilities. We have no off balance sheet financing relationships with variable interest or structured finance entities. COMMON STOCK OFFERING On July 28, 2004, we completed the sale of 13.8 million shares of our common stock in a public offering, including 1.8 million shares to cover overallotments, and received $229.7 million in net proceeds. The 13.8 million shares were reissued from treasury stock. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to enhance our abilities to make growth oriented investments, including capital investments and acquisitions that we believe will offer attractive returns. We also intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our outstanding liabilities, which may include making voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit trust or the repayment or repurchase of our long term debt securities. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for other general corporate purposes. In September 2004, we executed a portion of our strategy by making a voluntary contribution of $50 million to our U.S. defined benefit plan to improve the funded position of our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Based on current actuarial studies, we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to this defined benefit pension plan during the next several years. However, we may elect, depending upon the investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. 22 00 01 02 03 04 Managed Working Capital ($ millions) 853 719 564 576 853 Managed Working Capital as % of Sales 36.8% 36.8% 32.4% 30.7% 29.5% CASH FLOW AND WORKING CAPITAL In 2004, cash generated by operations of $74.1 million, proceeds from sale of common stock of $229.7 million, proceeds from asset sales of $6.6 million, and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $7.6 million, were used to invest $49.9 million in capital equipment, approximately half of which was for two major capital projects (in the Flat Rolled Products and High Performance Metals segments), fund a $50 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan, pay $7.5 million of the purchase price for the J&L assets, repay debt of $15.9 million, pay dividends of $21.2 million, and increase cash balances by $171.2 million, to $250.8 million at December 31, 2004. In 2003, cash generated from operations of $82.0 million, proceeds from asset sales of $9.8 million and proceeds from financing activities of $27.7 million, were used to invest $74.4 in capital equipment, primarily for two major projects (in the Flat Rolled Products and High Performance Metals segments), pay dividends of $19.4 million, and increase cash balances by $20.2 million, to $79.6 million at December 31, 2003. The impact of improved operating results in 2004 on cash flow from operations was offset by continuing investment in managed working capital to support the higher business levels and the impact of higher raw material costs. As part of managing the liquidity of the business, we focus on controlling inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. In measuring performance in controlling this managed working capital, we exclude the effects of the LIFO inventory valuation reserves, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which, due to their nature, are managed separately. During 2004, managed working capital, which we define as gross inventory plus accounts receivable less accounts payable, increased by $203.3 million, excluding working capital acquired as part of the J&L asset acquisition. This increase in managed working capital resulted from a $75.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales in the 2004 fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2003, and a $210.2 million increase in inventory mostly as a result of higher raw material costs and increased business volumes, partially offset by a $82.7 million increase in accounts payable. Most of the increase in raw materials is expected to be recovered through surcharge and index pricing mechanisms. While the absolute amount of managed working capital employed in the business has increased over the past three years, managed working capital as a percent of annualized sales has declined to 29.5% in 2004 from 30.7% in 2003, and 32.4% in 2002 as we have continued to focus on being more efficient in operating our businesses. While inventory and accounts receivable balances increased during 2004, gross inventory turns, which exclude the effect of LIFO inventory valuation reserves, and days sales outstanding, which measures actual collection timing for accounts receivable both have improved over the past two years. The components of managed working capital were as follows: December 31, December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Accounts receivable $ 357.9 $ 248.8 $ 239.3 Inventory 513.0 359.7 392.3 Accounts payable (271.2) (172.3) (171.3) Subtotal 599.7 436.2 460.3 Allowance for doubtful accounts 8.4 10.2 10.1 LIFO reserve 223.9 111.7 74.7 Corporate and other 20.6 17.4 18.6 Managed working capital $ 852.6 $ 575.5 $ 563.7 Annualized prior 2 months sales $ 2,887.0 $ 1,874.0 $ 1,741.0 Managed working capital as a % of sales 29.5% 30.7% 32.4% Capital expenditures for 2004 were $49.9 million compared to $74.4 million in 2003, as we completed our two major strategic capital projects begun in 2002: two new electric arc furnaces at our flat rolled products melt shop located in Brackenridge, PA, and investments to enhance the capabilities at our high performance metals long products rolling mill facility located in Richburg, SC. The second electric arc furnace in the Flat Rolled Products segment commenced operations in the 2004 third quarter, with the first new furnace having commenced production in 2003 fourth quarter. The high performance metals long products facility commenced operations in the 2004 second quarter. Capital expenditures in 2002 were $48.7 million as we controlled our investment spending due to the uncertain economy and to preserve liquidity. Capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to be between $85 and $100 million. 23 DEBT Total debt outstanding increased $50.6 million, to $582.7 million at December 31, 2004, from $532.1 million at December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily related to $59.5 million in seller financing for the J&L asset acquisition, partially offset by net debt repayments primarily for industrial revenue bonds. In managing our overall capital structure, one of the measures on which we focus is net debt to total capitalization, which is the percentage of our debt to our total invested and borrowed capital. In determining this measure, debt and total capitalization are net of cash on hand which may be available to reduce borrowings. Our net debt to total capitalization ratio improved to 43.8% at December 31, 2004 from 72.1% at the end of 2003. The lower ratio results primarily from an increase in cash on hand and stockholders equity resulting from the common stock offering and the improvement in results of operations, partially offset by an increase in outstanding debt due primarily to the seller financing for the J&L asset acquisition. December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2004 2003 Total debt $ 582.7 $ 532.1 Less: Cash (250.8) (79.6) Net debt 331.9 452.5 Net debt 331.9 452.5 Total stockholders equity 425.9 174.7 Total capital $ 757.8 $ 627.2 Net debt to capital ratio 43.8% 72.1% Interest rate swap contracts are used from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. In 2002, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with respect to a $150 million notional amount related to our 8.375% Notes due 2011 ("Notes"), which involved the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the contracts without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. These "receive fixed, pay floating" arrangements were designated as fair value hedges, and effectively converted $150 million of the Notes to variable rate debt. As a result, changes in the fair value of the swap contracts and the notional amount of the underlying fixed rate debt are recognized in the statement of operations. In 2003, we terminated the majority of these interest rate swap contracts and received $15.3 million in cash. Subsequent to the interest rate swap terminations, in 2003 we entered into new "receive fixed, pay floating" interest rate swap arrangements related to the Notes which re established, in total, a $150 million notional amount that effectively converted this portion of the Notes to variable rate debt. In the 2004 third quarter in light of the prospect of increasing short term interest rates, we terminated all remaining interest rate swap contracts still outstanding, and realized net cash proceeds of $1.5 million. These gains on settlement realized in 2004 and 2003 remain a component of the reported balance of the Notes, and are ratably recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes, which is approximately seven years. At December 31, 2004, the deferred settlement gain was $13.7 million. The result of the "receive fixed, pay floating" arrangements was a decrease in interest expense of $4.4 million, $6.7 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, compared to the fixed interest expense of the ten year Notes. During the 2003 second quarter, we entered into a $325 million four year senior secured domestic revolving credit facility ("the secured credit facility" or "the facility"), which was amended on April 15, 2004. The facility, which replaced a $250 million unsecured facility, is secured by all accounts receivable and inventory of our U.S. operations, and includes capacity for up to $175 million in letters of credit. As of December 31, 2004, there had been no borrowings made under either the secured credit facility or the former unsecured credit facility since the beginning of 2002. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the secured credit facility were approximately $121 million at December 31, 2004. The secured credit facility limits capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions of businesses, new indebtedness, asset divestitures, payment of dividends, and common stock repurchases which we may incur or undertake during the term of the facility without obtaining permission of the lending group. At December 31, 2004, the amount of dividends we could pay without the consent of the lending group was approximately $300 million. In addition, the secured credit facility contains a financial covenant, which is not measured unless our undrawn availability under the facility is less than $150 million. This financial covenant, when measured, requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") to fixed charges of at least 1.0 to 1.0. EBITDA is adjusted for non cash items such as income/loss on investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, non cash pension expense/income, and that portion of retiree medical and life insurance expenses paid from our VEBA trust. EBITDA is reduced by capital expenditures, as defined in the facility, and cash taxes paid, and increased for cash tax refunds. Fixed charges include gross interest expense, dividends paid and scheduled debt payments. At December 31, 2004, our undrawn availability under the 24 facility, which is calculated including outstanding letters of credit, other uses of credit and domestic cash on hand, was $325 million, and the amount that we could borrow at that date prior to requiring the application of a financial covenant test was $175 million. Changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to, or cost of, our existing credit facilities.

Includes $120.9 million utilized under the $325 million domestic secured credit facility for standby letters of credit, which renew annually and are used to support: $48.3 million of financing outside of the domestic secured credit facility, primarily for our foreign based operations; $31.4 million in workers compensation and general insurance arrangements; $39.8 million related to environmental matters; and $1.4 million for other matters. RETIREMENT BENEFITS As of November 30, 2004, our measurement date for pension accounting, the value of the accumulated pension benefit obligation (ABO) for our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the value of pension investments by approximately $245 million. A minimum pension liability was recognized in 2002 as a result of a severe decline in the equity markets from 2000 through 2002, higher benefit liabilities from long term labor contracts negotiated in 2001, and a lower assumed discount rate for valuing the pension liabilities. Accounting standards require that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension investments is less than the ABO at the annual measurement date. Accordingly, in the 2002 fourth quarter, we recorded a charge against stockholders equity of $406 million, net of deferred taxes, to write off our prepaid pension cost representing the previous overfunded portion of the pension plan, and to record a deferred pension asset for unamortized prior service cost relating to prior benefit enhancements. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, our adjustments of the minimum pension liability resulted in an increase to stockholders equity of $2 million for 2004 and $47 million for 2003, presented as other comprehensive income (loss). The recognition of the minimum pension liability in 2002, and the adjustments of the minimum pension liability in 2004 and 2003 do not affect our reported results of operations and do not have a cash impact. In accordance with accounting standards, the full charge against stockholders equity would be reversed in subsequent years if the value of pension plan investments returns to a level that exceeds the ABO as of a future annual measurement date. As of the 2004 annual measurement date, the value of pension investments was $1.85 billion and the ABO was $2.08 billion. Based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts, the ABO is projected to be approximately $2.08 billion at the 2005 annual measurement date, assuming no changes in the discount rate used to value benefit obligations. 25 We were not required to make cash contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan for 2004. During the third quarter 2004, we made a $50 million voluntary contribution to this defined benefit pension plan to improve the plans funded position. Based on current actuarial studies, we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan during the next several years. However, a significant decline in the value of plan investments in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding. Depending on the timing and amount, a requirement that we fund our defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may elect, depending upon investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. We fund certain retiree health care benefits for Allegheny Ludlum using investments held in a Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) trust. This allows us to recover a portion of the retiree medical costs. In accordance with our labor agreements, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, we funded $18.2 million, $14.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively, of retiree medical costs using the investments of the VEBA trust. We may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the investments held in the VEBA if the value of these investments exceed $25 million. The value of the investments held in the VEBA was approximately $100 million as of November 30, 2004. DIVIDENDS We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share of common stock during 2004 and 2003. On February 25, 2005, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 29, 2005, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 21, 2005. While we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we cannot make assurances that in the future we will not reduce the amount of dividends paid, or stop paying dividends, on our common stock. For example, in the 2002 fourth quarter, our Board of Directors substantially reduced the amount of our quarterly dividend from the levels we had been paying in previous quarters. The declaration and payment of dividends, if any, and the amount of such dividends depends upon matters deemed relevant by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, such as our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and any limitations imposed by law, credit agreements or senior securities, and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality. REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Revenue is recognized when title passes or as services are rendered. We have no significant unusual sale arrangements with any of our customers. We market our products to a diverse customer base, principally throughout the United States. Trade credit is extended based upon evaluations of each customers ability to perform its obligations, which are updated periodically. Accounts receivable reserves are based upon an aging of accounts and a review for collectibility of specific accounts. Accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $8.4 million at December 31, 2004 and $10.2 million at December 31, 2003, which represented 2.3% and 3.9%, respectively, of total gross accounts receivable. During 2004, we made no increases for doubtful accounts and wrote off $1.8 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve. During 2003, we recognized expense of $2.2 million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off $2.1 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve. INVENTORIES At December 31, 2004, we had net inventory of $513.0 million. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last in, first out (LIFO), first in, first out (FIFO) and average cost methods) or market, less progress payments. Costs include direct material, direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs. Most of our inventory is valued utilizing the LIFO costing methodology. Inventory of our non U.S. operations is valued using average cost or FIFO methods. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have recently been extremely volatile, especially during 2004 when raw material prices rose rapidly, compared to 2003. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rapid rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our 26 operating results. For example in 2004, the effect of the increase in raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which was $112.2 million higher than would have been recognized if we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. In a period of rising prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Conversely, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. In the 2004 second quarter, we changed our method of calculating LIFO inventories at our Allegheny Ludlum operations by reducing the overall number of Company wide inventory pools from 15 to eight, and by changing its calculation method for LIFO from the double extension method to the link chain method. We made the change in order to better match costs with revenues, to reflect the business structure of Allegheny Ludlum following the J&L asset acquisition, to provide for a LIFO adjustment more representative of Allegheny Ludlums actual inflation on its inventories, and to conform LIFO accounting methods with our other operations that use the LIFO inventory method. The cumulative effect of the change in methods and the pro forma effects of the change on prior years results of operations were not determinable. The effect of the change on the results of operations for 2004 was not material. We evaluate product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value. The calculation of a resulting reserve, if any, is recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified. At December 31, 2004, no such reserves were required. It is our general policy to write down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months. In some instances this criterion is up to twenty four months due to the longer manufacturing and distribution process for such products. ASSET IMPAIRMENT We monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets. An impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an assets use (including any proceeds from disposition) are less than the assets carrying value, and the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Changes in the expected use of a long lived asset group, and the financial performance of the long lived asset group and its operating segment, are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment. Future cash flow value may include appraisals for property, plant and equipment, land and improvements, future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets, and other operating considerations. At December 31, 2004, we had $205 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. Changes in the goodwill balance from 2003 are due to foreign currency translation. Of the total, $112 million related to the Flat Rolled Products segment, $67 million related to the High Performance Metals segment, and $26 million related to the Engineered Products segment. Goodwill is required to be reviewed annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The impairment test for goodwill is a two step process. The first step is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If this comparison reflects impairment, then the loss would be measured as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. Implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of all recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment during the fourth quarter. Our evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment includes estimating the fair market value of each of the reporting units which have goodwill associated with their operations using discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings valuation techniques, plus valuation comparisons to recent public sale transactions of similar businesses, if any. These valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results, cash flows including changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and the cost of capital. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions used were reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. No goodwill impairment was determined to exist for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002. INCOME TAXES Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, or differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits (assets) or costs (liabilities) to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. We evaluate on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, we believe that our deferred income tax assets will be realizable. Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is probable (more likely than not) that the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The evaluation, as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," includes the consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, regarding historical operating results including recent years with reported losses, the estimated timing of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, and potential tax planning strategies which may be employed to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused. Future realization of deferred income tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback, carryforward period available under tax law. 27 The recognition of a valuation allowance is recorded as a non cash charge to the income tax provision with an offsetting reserve against the deferred income tax asset. Should we generate pretax losses in future periods, a tax benefit would not be recorded and the valuation allowance recorded would increase. Under these circumstances the net loss recognized and net loss per share for that period would be larger than a comparable period when a favorable tax benefit was recorded. However, tax provisions or benefits would continue to be recognized, as appropriate, on state and local taxes, and taxes related to foreign jurisdictions. The recognition of a valuation allowance, in itself, does not affect our ability to utilize the deferred tax asset in the future. The valuation allowance could be reduced or increased in future years if the estimated realizability of the deferred income tax asset changes, based upon consideration of all available evidence, including changes in the carryback period available under tax law. CONTINGENCIES When it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired, we recognize a loss if the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants, and disposal of wastes, and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. We could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party sites. With respect to proceedings brought under the Federal Superfund laws, or similar state statutes, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at approximately 33 of such sites, excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability. Our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately 19 of these sites, and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining 14 individual sites is not considered to be material. We are a party to various cost sharing arrangements with other PRPs at the sites. The terms of the cost sharing arrangements are subject to non disclosure agreements as confidential information. Nevertheless, the cost sharing arrangements generally require all PRPs to post financial assurance of the performance of the obligations or to pre pay into an escrow or trust account their share of anticipated site related costs. In addition, the Federal government, through various agencies, is a party to several such arrangements. Environmental liabilities are recorded when our liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable. In many cases, we are not able to determine whether we are liable or, if liability is probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. Estimates of our liability are further subject to additional uncertainties including the nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the participation, number and financial condition of other PRPs. We expect that we will adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments. At December 31, 2004, our reserves for environmental matters totaled approximately $29 million. Accruals for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not take into account the effects of inflation, and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. The accruals are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties, but do reflect allocations among PRPs at Federal Superfund sites or similar state managed sites after an assessment is made of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites and after appropriate cost sharing or other agreements are entered. Our measurement of environmental liabilities is based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations, and current technology. Such estimates take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation, the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities, and the professional judgment of our environmental experts in consultation with outside environmental specialists, when necessary. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the matters with which we are currently associated (either individually or in the aggregate) will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters, however, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. RETIREMENT BENEFITS We have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans covering substantially all of our employees. During the third quarter 2004, we made a $50 million voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. defined pension plan to improve the plans funded position. We are not required to make a contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan for 2005, and, based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts, we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan for at least the next several years. However, we may elect, depending upon the investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. 28 We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS 87, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. A significant element in determining our pension (expense) income in accordance with SFAS 87 is the expected investment return on plan assets. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration input from our third party pension plan asset managers and actuaries regarding the types of securities the plan investments are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. For 2003, in light of the declines in the equity markets in 2000 through 2002, which comprise a significant portion of our pension plan investments, we lowered our expected return on pension plan investments to 8.75%, from a 9% expected return on pension plan investments which was used in 2002. This assumed rate is applied to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension (expense) income for the current year. While the actual return on pension plan investments for 2004 was 11.7% and for 2003 was 13.1%, our expected return on pension plan investments for 2005 remains at 8.75%. The effect of increasing, or lowering, the expected return on pension plan investments by 0.25% results in additional annual income, or expense, of approximately $4 million. The cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods. The amount of expected return on plan assets can vary significantly from year to year since the calculation is dependent on the market value of plan assets as of the end of the preceding year. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to calculate the expected return on pension assets using either an average of fair market values of pension assets over a period not to exceed five years, which reduces the volatility in reported pension income or expense, or their fair market value at the end of the previous year. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission currently does not permit companies to change from the fair market value at the end of the previous year methodology, which is the methodology that we use, to an averaging of fair market values of plan assets methodology. As a result, our results of operations and those of other companies, including companies with which we compete, may not be comparable due to these different methodologies in calculating the expected return on pension investments. If the five year average of the fair market values of plan assets had been used to calculate retirement benefit costs, we estimate that retirement benefit expense for 2004 would have been approximately $65 million less than the $120 million expense recognized using the fair market value approach. At the end of November of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to value pension plan liabilities. In accordance with SFAS 87, the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. In estimating this rate, we receive input from our actuaries regarding the rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments with maturities matched to the expected future retirement benefit payments. Based on this assessment at the end of November 2004, we established a discount rate of 6.1% for valuing the pension liabilities as of the end of 2004, and for determining the pension expense for 2005. We had previously assumed a discount rate of 6.50% for 2003, which determined the 2004 expense, and 6.75% for 2002, which determined the 2003 expense. The effect of lowering the discount rate to 6.1% increased pension liabilities by approximately $81 million at 2004 year end, and is expected to increase pension expense by approximately $6 million in 2005. The effect on pension liabilities for changes to the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, are deferred and amortized over future periods in accordance with SFAS 87. Accounting standards require a minimum pension liability be recorded when the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") at the annual measurement date. As of November 30, 2004, our measurement date for pension accounting, the value of the accumulated pension benefit obligation (ABO) exceeded the value of pension investments by approximately $245 million. In the 2002 fourth quarter, as a result of a severe decline in the equity markets in 2000 through 2002, higher benefit liabilities from long term labor contracts negotiated in 2001, and a lower assumed discount rate for valuing the pension liabilities, we recorded a non cash charge against stockholders equity of $406 million, net of deferred taxes, to write off our prepaid pension cost representing the previous overfunded portion of the pension plan, and to record a deferred pension asset of $165 million for the unamortized prior service cost relating to prior benefit enhancements. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, our adjustments of the minimum pension liability resulted in an increase to stockholders equity of $2 million for 2004 and $47 million for 2003, presented as other comprehensive income (loss). The recognition of the minimum pension liability in 2002, and the adjustments of minimum pension liability in 2004 and 2003 do not affect our reported results of operations and do not have a cash impact. In accordance with accounting standards, the charge against stockholders equity will be adjusted in the fourth quarter of subsequent years to reflect the value of pension assets compared to the ABO as of the end of November. If the level of pension assets exceeds the ABO as of a future measurement date, the full charge against stockholders equity would be reversed. We also sponsor several postretirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees and retirees. These plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. In certain plans, our contributions towards premiums are capped based upon the cost as of a certain date, thereby creating a defined contribution. For the non collectively bargained plans, we maintain the right to amend or terminate the plans in the future. We account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as benefits are paid. We use actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefits obligations for the plans. The discount rate, which is determined annually at the end of November of each 29 year, is developed based upon rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. At the end of 2004, we determined this rate to be 6.1%, a reduction from a 6.5% discount rate in 2003 and 6.75% in 2002. The effect of lowering the discount rate to 6.1% from 6.5% increased 2004 postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $20 million, and 2005 expenses are expected to increase by approximately $1 million. Based upon significant cost increases quoted by our medical care providers and predictions of continued significant medical cost inflation in future years, the annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits for health care plans was 10.0% for 2005 and was assumed to gradually decrease to 5.0% in the year 2014 and remain level thereafter. The other postretirement benefits obligation at end of year 2003 did not include the expected favorable impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act ("Medicare Act"), which was signed into law on December 8, 2003. The Medicare Act provides for a federal subsidy, with tax free payments commencing in 2006, to sponsors of retiree health care benefits plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by the law. Based upon estimates from our actuaries, the federal subsidy included in the law resulted in a reduction in the other postretirement benefits obligation during 2004 of $46 million. This reduction is recognized in the financial statements over a number of years, and is expected to reduce postretirement benefit expense in 2005 by approximately $3 million. Certain of these postretirement benefits are funded using plan investments held in a VEBA trust. The expected return on plan investments is a significant element in determining postretirement benefits expenses in accordance with SFAS 106. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration the types of securities the plan investments are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. For 2004, our expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 9%. This assumed long term rate of return on investments is applied to the market value of plan investments at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan investments that is included in annual postretirement benefits expenses for the current year. While the actual return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 11.6% in 2004 and 9.3% for 2003, our expected return on investments in the VEBA trust remains 9% for 2005. The expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust is expected to exceed the return on pension plan investments due to a higher percentage of private equity investments held by the VEBA trust. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets, such as landfill and other facility closure costs, are capitalized and amortized to expense over an assets useful life using a systematic and rational allocation method. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 resulted in a charge of $1.3 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per share, which was recognized in our first quarter 2003 statement of operations as a cumulative change in accounting principle, primarily for asset retirement obligations related to landfills. Accretion expense and cash flows associated with ARO obligations have not been material since the adoption of FAS 143. In December 2003, the Medicare Act was signed into law. The Medicare Act provides for a Federal subsidy, with tax free payments commencing in 2006, to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 106 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" ("FSP 106 2"), which provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Act. Under FSP 106 2, the effect of the Federal subsidy is accounted for as an actuarial experience gain. In addition, the effect of the Medicare Act is taken into consideration, as appropriate, in determining an employers future per capita claims cost. Based upon estimates from our actuaries, it is expected that the effect of the Medicare Act will result in a reduction in the Accumulated Other Postretirement Benefits obligation of $46 million. The benefit will be recognized in our financial statements over multiple years as a reduction to postretirement benefits expense. We adopted FSP 106 2 in the beginning of the third quarter 2004, resulting in approximately $2 million lower postretirement benefit expense in 2004. For 2005, the reduction in expense as a result of the Medicare Act is estimated to be approximately $3 million. In December 2004, the FASB finalized Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). This revised standard addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the companys equity instruments. Under the revised standard, companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. Instead, companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize expense in the consolidated statements of income. SFAS 123R is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R no later than the beginning of our 2005 third quarter. We will adopt the new standard using the modified prospective method and reflect compensation expense in accordance with the FAS 123R transition provisions. Under the modified prospective method, we will not restate prior periods to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard at earlier dates. Pro forma disclosures regarding the effect on our 2004 net income and net income per common share had we applied the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation as prescribed by SFAS 123, were $3.8 million of additional 30 expense, or $0.04 less net income per common share. We have not yet determined which fair value model we will follow for future grants of share based compensation. Based on share based compensation granted through December 31, 2004 and the fair values previously calculated under SFAS 123, we project that an immaterial amount of additional compensation expense would be recorded in 2005 related to stock options and nonvested stock upon the adoption of SFAS 123R, compared to the existing accounting method under APB Opinion No. 25. We are still evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our Total Shareholder Return share based compensation plan. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("Jobs Creation Act") was signed into law. The Jobs Creation Act contains a number of provisions that may affect our future effective income tax rate. The most significant provisions would allow us to elect to deduct from our taxable income 85% of certain eligible dividends received by ATI from non U.S. subsidiaries before the end of 2005 if those dividends are reinvested in the U.S. for eligible purposes, and separately, enable ATI to receive a tax deduction of up to 9%, when fully phased in over several years, to "qualified production activities income," as defined. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109 1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109 1"), which requires the qualified production activities deduction be treated as a special deduction which would therefore be recognized as earned. FSP 109 1 was effective upon issuance, and required no adjustment to recorded deferred tax balances, which are determined using projected future income tax rates. In December 2004, the FASB also issued FASB Staff Position No. 109 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109 2"), which provided additional time beyond the financial statement date of the period in which a new tax law is enacted, or December 31, 2004 for ATI, for a company to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Creation Act. In accordance with the provisions of FSP 109 2, we continue to evaluate the repatriation provision, including ongoing clarifications to how the Jobs Creation Act is to be applied. Based on this evaluation, we are unable to determine if there will be any material impact to 2005 results from the Jobs Creation Act Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision. BOARD OF DIRECTORS On May 6, 2004, the Board of Directors named L. Patrick Hassey Chairman, in addition to his responsibilities as President and Chief Executive Officer, and H. Kent Bowen and John D. Turner were elected to our Board of Directors. On July 8, 2004, Frank V. Cahouet resigned from the Companys Board of Directors. On September 2, 2004, ATI elected Michael J. Joyce and Louis J. Thomas to our Board of Directors. Both Mr. Joyce and Mr. Thomas will stand for election at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS From time to time, the Company has made and may continue to make "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements in this report relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include those containing such words as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "would," "should," "will," "will likely result," "forecast," "outlook," "projects," and similar expressions. Such forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which the Company is unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results or performance to materially differ from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such statements. Various of these factors are described from time to time in the Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Reports on Form 10 Q. We assume no duty to update our forward looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in such forward looking statements include the following: Cyclical Demand for Products. The cyclical nature of the industries in which our customers operate causes demand for our products to be cyclical, creating uncertainty regarding future profitability. Various changes in general economic conditions affect the industries in which our customers operate. These changes include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers products due to economic downturns. Other factors causing fluctuation in our customers positions are changes in market demand, lower overall pricing due to domestic and international overcapacity, currency fluctuations, lower priced imports and increases in use or decreases in prices of substitute materials. As a result of these factors, our profitability has been and may in the future be subject to significant fluctuation. A significant portion of the sales of our High Performance Metals segment represents products sold to customers in the commercial aerospace industry. From time to time, economic and other factors, including the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, have adversely affected the airline industry, resulting in overall reduced demand for the products that we sell to the commercial aerospace market. A downturn in the commercial aerospace industry could adversely affect our results of operations, and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Product Pricing. From time to time, intense competition and excess manufacturing capacity in the commodity stainless steel industry have resulted in reduced prices, excluding raw material surcharges, for many of our stainless steel products. These factors have had and may have an adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. Although inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate, during the same period certain critical raw material costs, such as nickel and scrap containing iron and nickel, have been volatile. While we are able to mitigate some of the 31 adverse impact of rising raw material costs through surcharges to customers, rapid increases in raw material costs may adversely affect our results of operations. We change prices on certain of our products from time to time. The ability to implement price increases is dependent on market conditions, economic factors, raw material costs and availability, competitive factors, operating costs and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. The benefits of any price increases may be delayed due to long manufacturing lead times and the terms of existing contracts. Dependence on Critical Raw Materials or Services Subject to Price and Availability Fluctuations. We rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply certain raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products. We also depend on third parties to provide conversion services that may be critical to the manufacture of our products. Purchase prices and availability of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials or services on a timely basis, on price and other terms acceptable, or at all. If suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to customers and accepted customer orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, or have existing contracts, we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. The manufacture of some of our products is a complex process and requires long lead times. As a result, we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials or conversion services. If unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials or conversion services, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions and suffer harm to our reputation. We acquire certain important raw materials that we use to produce specialty materials, including nickel, chrome, cobalt, titanium sponge and ammonia paratungstate, from foreign sources. Some of these sources operate in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions. These conditions may disrupt supplies or affect the prices of these materials. Volatility of Raw Material Costs. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have recently been extremely volatile. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in, first out (LIFO) inventory costing methodology, a rapid rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. For example, in 2004, the increase in raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which was $112.2 million higher than would have been recognized if we utilized the first in, first out (FIFO) methodology to value our inventory. In a period of rising raw material prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Conversely, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Availability of Energy Resources. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the supply of energy resources could temporarily impair the ability to manufacture products for customers. Further, increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, has and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Associated with Retirement Benefits. Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan was funded in accordance with ERISA as of December 31, 2004. Based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts, we do not expect to be required to make contributions to the defined benefit pension plan for at least the next several years. However, a significant decline in the value of plan investments in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding. Depending on the timing and amount, a requirement that we fund our defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Associated with Accessing the Credit Markets. Our ability to access the credit markets in the future to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be influenced by the Companys credit rating. However, changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to our existing credit facilities. Credit Agreement Covenant. The agreement governing our secured bank credit facility imposes a number of covenants on us. For example, it contains covenants that create limitations on our ability to, among other things, effect acquisitions or dispositions or incur additional debt, and require us to, among other things, maintain a financial ratio when our available borrowing capacity measured under the credit agreement decreases below $150 million. Our ability to comply with the financial covenant may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may be unable to comply with the covenant, which may adversely affect our ability to borrow under our secured credit facility if the availability level is below $150 million. Risks Associated with Environmental Matters. We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants, and disposal of wastes, and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. We could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a 32 result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party locations sites. With respect to proceedings brought under the federal Superfund laws, or similar state statutes, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at approximately 33 of such sites, excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability. Our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately 19 of these sites, and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining 14 individual sites is not considered to be material. We are a party to various cost sharing arrangements with other PRPs at the sites. The terms of the cost sharing arrangements are subject to non disclosure agreements as confidential information. Nevertheless, the cost sharing arrangements generally require all PRPs to post financial assurance of the performance of the obligations or to pre pay into an escrow or trust account their share of anticipated site related costs. In addition, the Federal government, through various agencies, is a party to several such arrangements. We believe that we operate our businesses in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings involving alleged violations of, or liabilities arising from environmental laws. When our liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate our costs, we record environmental liabilities in our financial statements. In many cases, we are not able to determine whether we are liable, or if liability is probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. Estimates of our liability remain subject to additional uncertainties, including the nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the participation number and financial condition of other PRPs, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation. We expect that we will adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments. At December 31, 2004, our reserves for environmental matters totaled approximately $29 million. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the sites with which the we are currently associated (either individually or in the aggregate) will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters, however, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Risks Associated with Current or Future Litigation and Claims. A number of lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our currently and formerly owned business, including those pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, commercial, employment, employee benefits, taxes, environmental and health and safety, and stockholder matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to us, we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period. Also, we can give no assurance that any other matters brought in the future will not have a material effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Labor Matters. We have approximately 9,000 full time employees. A portion of our workforce is covered by various collective bargaining agreements, principally with the United Steelworkers of America ("USWA"), including: approximately 2,950 Allegheny Ludlum production, office and maintenance employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, which are effective through June 2007; approximately 220 Oremet employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which is effective through June 2007; approximately 565 Wah Chang employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which continues through March 2008, and approximately 180 employees at the Casting Service facility in LaPorte, Indiana, covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which is effective through December 2007. Generally, agreements that expire may be terminated after notice by the union. After termination, the union may authorize a strike. A strike by the employees covered by one or more of the collective bargaining agreements could have a materially adverse affect on our operating results. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the unions to replace those that expire. Risks Associated with Acquisition and Disposition Strategies. We intend to continue to strategically position our businesses in order to improve our ability to compete. We plan to do this by seeking specialty niches, expanding our global presence, acquiring businesses complementary to existing strengths and continually evaluating the performance and strategic fit of existing business units. We regularly consider acquisition, joint ventures, and other business combination opportunities as well as possible business unit dispositions. From time to time, management holds discussions with management of other companies to explore such opportunities. As a result, the relative makeup of the businesses comprising our Company is subject to change. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and other business combinations involve various inherent risks, such as: assessing accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition or other transaction candidates; the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business; our ability to achieve identified financial and operating synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction; and unanticipated changes in 33 business and economic conditions affecting an acquisition or other transaction. International acquisitions and other transactions could be affected by export controls, exchange rate fluctuations, domestic and foreign political conditions and a deterioration in domestic and foreign economic conditions. Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Insurance. We have maintained various forms of insurance, including insurance covering claims related to our properties and risks associated with our operations. Our existing property and liability insurance coverages contain exclusions and limitations on coverage. In connection with renewals of insurance, we have experienced additional exclusions and limitations on coverage, larger self insured retentions and deductibles and significantly higher premiums. As a result, in the future our insurance coverage may not cover claims to the extent that it has in the past and the costs that we incur to procure insurance may increase significantly, either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Political and Social Turmoil. The war on terrorism and recent political and social turmoil, including terrorist and military actions and the implications of the military actions in Iraq, could put pressure on economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These political, social and economic conditions could make it difficult for us, our suppliers and our customers to forecast accurately and plan future business activities, and could adversely affect the financial condition of our suppliers and customers and affect customer decisions as to the amount and timing of purchases from us. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Export Sales. We believe that export sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our future revenues. Risks associated with export sales include: political and economic instability, including weak conditions in the worlds economies; accounts receivable collection; export controls; changes in legal and regulatory requirements; policy changes affecting the markets for our products; changes in tax laws and tariffs; and exchange rate fluctuations (which may affect sales to international customers and the value of profits earned on export sales when converted into dollars). Any of these factors could materially adversely effect our results for the period in which they occur. Risks Associated with Government Contracts. Some of our operating companies directly perform contractual work for the U.S. Government. Various claims (whether based on U.S. Government or Company audits and investigations or otherwise) could be asserted against us related to our U.S. Government contract work. Depending on the circumstances and the outcome, such proceedings could result in fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages or the cancellation or suspension of payments under one or more U.S. Government contracts. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or units, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts based on the results of investigations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AND OTHER MATTERS Interest Rate Risk. We attempt to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $90 million of floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.8%. Since the interest rate on this debt floats with the short term market rate of interest, we are exposed to the risk that these interest rates may increase. For example, a hypothetical 1% in rate of interest on $90 million of outstanding floating rate debt would result in increased annual financing costs of $0.9 million. Approximately $52 million of this floating rate debt is capped at a 6% maximum interest rate. Volatility of Energy Prices. Energy resources markets are subject to conditions that create uncertainty in the prices and availability of energy resources. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, has and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We use approximately 10 to 12 million MMBtus of natural gas annually, depending upon business conditions, in the manufacture of our products. These purchases of natural gas expose us to risk of higher gas prices. For example, a hypothetical $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of approximately $10 to $12 million. Volatility of Raw Material Prices. We use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of increased raw material costs; however, competitive factors in the marketplace can limit our ability to institute such mechanisms, and there can be a delay between the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefit of such mechanisms. For example, since we generally use in excess of 45,000 tons of nickel each year, a hypothetical change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately $90 million. In addition, we also use in excess of 340,000 tons of ferrous scrap in the production of our products and a hypothetical change of $10.00 per ton would result in increased costs of approximately $3.4 million. While we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations, such as for nickel, we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure. We believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts, but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials. 34
