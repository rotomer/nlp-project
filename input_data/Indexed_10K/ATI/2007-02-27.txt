Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements. Actual results or performance could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described below. Overview of 2006 Financial Performance ATIs 2006 performance was a record year for sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share. Net income for the full year 2006 increased 59% to $571.9 million, or $5.59 per share, compared to $359.8 million, or $3.57 per share, for 2005. For 2006, return on capital employed was 34.5%, and return on stockholders equity was 49.9%. Sales increased 39% to $4.94 billion for 2006 as higher base selling prices, the effect of raw material surcharges, and higher shipments for most of our major products resulted from improved business conditions in most of the major markets we serve. Our continued growth is being driven by strong and increasing demand from the aerospace and defense market and increasing demand from those markets that are vital to the building and rebuilding of the global infrastructure. For 2006, 30% of our sales were to the aerospace and defense market, 19% to the chemical process industry and oil and gas markets, 11% to the electrical energy market, and 3% to the medical market. These major high value markets represented 63% of ATIs 2006 sales. In our High Performance Metals segment, year over year sales increased 45% to $1.81 billion due primarily to continuing strong demand from the aerospace and defense, medical, and oil and gas markets for our titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys, and continued strong demand for our exotic materials, especially from the aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, and electrical energy markets. Operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment improved to $657.5 million, a 96% increase compared to 2005, due primarily to the improved pricing and increased shipments resulting from increased demand and benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts, partially offset by the impact on the LIFO inventory accounting methodology from rising raw material costs. In our Flat Rolled Products segment, sales increased 42% to $2.70 billion due primarily to strong demand for our products from the global chemical process industry, electrical energy, and oil and gas markets, and good demand from construction, appliance and automotive markets. This improvement in demand, combined with higher base prices for most of the Flat Rolled Products segment products and the benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts, more than offset the significant negative impact of the LIFO inventory accounting methodology from rising raw material costs, and resulted in an operating profit for this segment of $344.3 million, a 130% improvement compared to 2005. Results for our Engineered Products segment also improved, as sales increased to $432.7 million, or 10%, compared to 2005, and operating profit increased to $56.7 million, a 19% increase, due to improved demand from the oil and gas, construction and mining, aerospace and defense, power generation, and transportation markets, plus benefits from our gross cost reduction actions. Total segment operating profit increased to $1.06 billion, an increase of $525.8 million compared to 2005. This significant improvement in segment profitability was achieved after LIFO inventory valuation reserve charges of $197.0 million, due primarily to higher overall raw material costs, which was partially offset by the benefits of $141 million in gross cost reductions across the Company. During 2006, we continued to enhance our leading market positions, reduce costs, and improve our balance sheet. We also realized continued success in implementing the ATI Business System, which is driving lean manufacturing throughout our operations. Our accomplishments during 2006 from these important efforts included: We continued to grow our global market presence as direct international sales reached a record $1.17 billion, or 24% of total sales, an increase of $300.7 million compared to 2005. During 2006, we realigned our European sales and distribution organization to better support our customer needs and the distribution of ATIs products. We continued to build a foundation for further profitable growth. During 2006, we entered into long term agreements with aerospace and defense customers to supply them with titanium and nickel based superalloys. 21 Table of Contents The commercial aerospace markets use of titanium is expected to increase significantly as new aircraft airframe production is utilizing a larger percentage of titanium material. For example, the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner airframe (excluding engines), which is expected to be put into service beginning in 2008, will utilize approximately 250,000 pounds (buy weight) of titanium alloys per aircraft, a significant increase over any previous commercial aircraft airframe. The new aircraft designs from Airbus, the A380 and A350 XWB, and from defense contractors are also expected to utilize a greater percentage of titanium. Given the significant backlog and development plans by the aircraft manufacturers, this increasing demand for titanium alloys is expected to last into the next decade. We significantly increased self funded strategic capital investments in our businesses to support the growth in our markets, especially for titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys. The major strategic capital projects include: A significant upgrade to and restarting of our titanium sponge facility in Albany, OR at a total capital investment of approximately $100 million, including the announced expansion in February 2007. Titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products. The annual production of titanium sponge from our Albany, OR facility will ramp up through the first half of 2007 when it will reach an annualized production rate of approximately 16 million pounds, and will reach approximately 20 million pounds of annualized production by the second half of 2008 when all phases are completed. The design and construction of a greenfield premium grade titanium sponge facility in Rowley, UT, which will be the first greenfield titanium sponge facility built in the U.S. in over thirty years. The updated estimate of the cost of this facility is expected to be $425 to $450 million, including engineering and design for future expansion. Titanium sponge production from the Rowley UT facility is expected to begin in late 2008 and reach an initial annualized production rate of approximately 24 million pounds in 2009. When the Oregon and Utah facilities are operational in 2009, our total annual titanium sponge production capacity is expected to be approximately 44 million pounds, and is intended to supplement our purchased titanium sponge and purchased titanium scrap requirements. The design and construction of a $215 million titanium alloys and nickel based alloys and superalloy forging facility in the Carolinas. This new facility, which is expected to be constructed in phases through 2009, will include a new 10,000 ton press forge and a new 700mm rotary forge, both of which will be the largest of their kind in the world for producing these types of alloys. It will also include billet conditioning and finishing equipment. We will also add our fourth Plasma Arc Melt (PAM) furnace for cold hearth melting premium titanium alloys, primarily for aeroengine rotating quality applications, and we will build additional vacuum arc remelt (VAR) capacity to support premium nickel based superalloy and titanium growth. These investments are expected to commence production in phases through 2009. A $60 million upgrade and expansion of our titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys, stainless steel, and specialty alloys plate finishing facility in Washington, PA. This upgrade and expansion is expected to be completed in 2008. A significant expansion of our capability to produce ammonium paratungstate (APT), a raw material used in the production of tungsten powder and tungsten materials in our Engineered Products segment. This investment is expected to position ATI to be self sufficient for APT, by producing this important raw material from scrap at a much lower cost than purchased APT. The full benefit of this expansion is expected to be realized beginning in the first half of 2007. Our Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), in which ATI has a 60% interest, commenced an expansion of its Precision Rolled Strip operations in Shanghai, China. This expansion is expected to more than triple STALs precision rolling and slitting capacity when fully operational in 2009. We realized strong cash generation in 2006. Cash on hand at the end of 2006 was $502.3 million, an increase of $140 million compared to the end of 2005. This increase in cash is after investing $534 million in managed working capital due primarily to higher business activity, $235 million in capital expenditures, $100 million in a 22 Table of Contents voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, and $43 million in dividend payments. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet. Our net debt to total capitalization improved to 3.3% at December 31, 2006, compared to 19.8%, 43.8% and 72.1% at year end 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At the end of 2006, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was essentially fully funded. This is significant as the previous funded status of the plan had a significant negative impact on our balance sheet. As a result of the improvement in funding status, total retirement benefit expense is expected to decline by $50 million in 2007, compared to 2006. We continued to realize significant improvement in safety across ATIs operations. As a result of our continuing focus on and commitment to safety, in 2006 our OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate improved by 19% and our Lost Time Case Rate improved by 42%, both compared to 2005. We realized continued success from the ATI Business System, which is driving lean manufacturing throughout our operations. In addition to $141 million in gross cost reductions achieved in 2006, which was $41 million higher than our 2006 goal of $100 million, and the improved safety performance discussed above, another result of our ATI Business System efforts was the continuing improvement in managed working capital. We define managed working capital as accounts receivable and gross inventories less accounts payable. At December 31, 2006, managed working capital improved to 29.0% of annualized sales compared to 30.3% at 2005 year end. With the continuing strength in our major end markets and confidence in ATIs ability to continue to generate strong cash flow over the next several years, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 30% to $0.13 per share in December 2006. This is the second consecutive year the Board has significantly increased the dividend. As a result of these accomplishments, we believe that the foundation has been set for further profitable growth in 2007 and beyond. Our businesses are positioned to continue to deliver outstanding operational performance. We have several major long term customer supply agreements in place, and ATIs presence and sales are growing around the world. Our strategic capital projects are expected to contribute significant growth with very good returns beginning in 2007. To achieve additional growth and to meet the demands for our products from the global markets we serve, we plan $450 to $500 million of self funded capital investments in 2007, approximately 70% of which is related to the previously announced strategic growth projects discussed above. We expect strong cash flow in 2007 to support this level of investment. We remain dedicated to our disciplined plan and vision of Building the Worlds Best Specialty Metals Company. Results of Operations Sales were $4.94 billion in 2006, $3.54 billion in 2005 and $2.73 billion in 2004. Direct international sales represented approximately 24% of 2006 sales, 25% of 2005 sales and 20% of 2004 sales. Segment operating profit was $1.06 billion in 2006, $532.7 million in 2005, and $167.1 million in 2004. Our measure of segment operating profit, which we use to analyze the performance and results of our business segments, excludes income taxes, corporate expenses, net interest expense, retirement benefit expense, other costs net of gains on asset sales, curtailment gains and restructuring costs, if any. We believe segment operating profit, as defined, provides an appropriate measure of controllable operating results at the business segment level. Income before tax and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $869.2 million in 2006, $307.1 million in 2005, and $19.8 million in 2004. For 2005, income before tax included a restructuring charge of $23.9 million for asset impairments and a charge of $12.6 million for legal matters. Income before tax for 2004 included a curtailment gain, net of restructuring charges, of $40.4 million. Income before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $571.9 million for 2006, $361.8 million for 2005, and $19.8 million for 2004. Net income for 2005 included a $20.9 million net special gain, which included a tax benefit associated with the reversal of the Companys remaining valuation allowance for U.S. Federal net deferred tax assets, partially offset by asset impairments charges in the Flat Rolled Products segment, charges 23 Table of Contents for legal matters, and the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle for conditional asset retirement obligations. Results for 2004 did not include an income tax provision or benefit for current or deferred taxes primarily as a result of the uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax assets and available operating loss carryforwards. Net income for 2004 included a curtailment gain, net of restructuring costs of $40.4 million, related to the elimination of retiree medical benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees beginning in 2010, and costs associated with the acquisition of the JL assets and the 2004 labor agreement. We operate in three business segments: High Performance Metals, Flat Rolled Products and Engineered Products. These segments represented the following percentages of our total revenues and segment operating profit for the years indicated: 2006 2005 2004 Operating Operating Operating Revenue Profit Revenue Profit Revenue Profit High Performance Metals 37 % 62 % 35 % 63 % 29 % 51 % Flat Rolled Products 54 % 33 % 54 % 28 % 60 % 37 % Engineered Products 9 % 5 % 11 % 9 % 11 % 12 % Information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

These products are designed for the high performance requirements of such major end markets as aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, medical and electrical energy. The operating units in this segment are ATI Allvac, ATI Allvac Ltd (U.K.) and ATI Wah Chang. 2006 Compared to 2005 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment for 2006 were $1.81 billion, or 45% higher than 2005, due primarily to increased volume and higher average selling prices for most of our products driven by strong demand from the aerospace and defense, medical, oil and gas, chemical process industry, and electrical energy markets. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): Nickel based and specialty steel alloys 42,873 39,939 7 % Titanium mill products 27,361 24,882 10 % Exotic alloys 4,304 4,018 7 % Average Prices (per lb.): Nickel based and specialty steel alloys $ 14.35 $ 11.25 28 % Titanium mill products $ 33.83 $ 22.75 49 % Exotic alloys $ 40.39 $ 40.38 % Aerospace represents a significant market for our High Performance Metals segment, especially for premium quality specialty metals used in the manufacture of jet engines for the original equipment and spare parts markets. In addition, we are becoming a larger supplier of specialty metals used in airframe construction. In January 2007, we 24 Table of Contents announced a long term sourcing agreement with GE Aviation for the supply of premium titanium, nickel based superalloy, and vacuum melted specialty alloy products for commercial and military jet engine applications. Total revenues under this agreement plus Allvacs direct sales to GE Aviation for the period 2007 through 2011 may exceed $2 billion. In addition, in October 2006 we announced a long term agreement with The Boeing Company to supply titanium products for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other Boeing aircraft airframes. Total revenues under this contract are valued at approximately $2.5 billion for the years 2007 through 2015. This long term agreement includes both long product forms which are manufactured within the High Performance Metals segment, and a significant amount of plate products which are manufactured utilizing assets of both the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products segments. Revenues and profits associated with these mill products covered by the long term agreement are included primarily in the results for the High Performance Metals segment. The demand from the aerospace market has recovered from the decline after the effect of the tragedy of September 11, 2001. Annually, revenue passenger miles and freight miles have increased 9.7% and 7.3%, respectively, since 2003, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The ICAO expects this growth trend to continue at over 6% annually well into the next decade based on the demand for passenger and freight travel from developing economies, especially in Asia and the Middle East, and continuing economic growth in the rest of the world. Commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries of new aircraft have increased 8.4% annually since 2003. Independent forecasts from both Airline Monitor and Forecast International project continuing growth of commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries into the next decade. Due to manufacturing cycle times, demand for our specialty metals leads the deliveries of new aircraft by 12 to 18 months. In addition, as our specialty metals are used in jet engines, demand for our products for spare parts is impacted by aircraft flight activity and engine refurbishment requirements of U.S. and foreign aviation regulatory authorities.

Segment results in 2006 and 2005 were adversely affected by higher raw material costs, which increased significantly in the past several years. These higher costs, while largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material indices, had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our LIFO inventory accounting methodology, resulting in LIFO inventory valuation reserve charges of $49.4 million in 2006 and $46.0 million in 2005. We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2006. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled approximately $39 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $20 million from procurement, $15 million from operating efficiencies, and $3 million from salaried and hourly labor cost savings. To support our strategic growth initiatives in the High Performance Metals segment, in 2006 we committed to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities. Including projects announced in 2005, 2006 and to date in 2007, we will spend approximately $625 million in a multi phase titanium products expansion that is expected to yield 44 million pounds of annual titanium sponge production capacity and increase ATIs annual titanium melt capacity by at least 25 million pounds. These strategic titanium capital investments are designed to expand and enhance ATIs capacity 27 Table of Contents and capabilities to meet current and expected demand growth from the aerospace (both engine and airframe), defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, and medical markets. The expansion includes the following phases: The Phase I expansion of ATIs titanium production capabilities was announced on July 15, 2005, and includes upgrading and restarting ATIs titanium sponge facility in Albany, OR, constructing a third Plasma Arc Melt (PAM) cold hearth furnace in Bakers, NC, adding three vacuum arc remelt (VAR) furnaces, expanding high value plate products capacity by 25%, and continued upgrading of ATIs cold rolling assets used in producing titanium sheet and strip products. Phase I of our Albany, OR titanium sponge facility is now fully operational with six new furnaces producing at an annualized rate of approximately 8.0 million pounds, and the additional VAR melt capacity began operations in late 2006 and early 2007. The new PAM furnace is expected to begin operations in the first quarter 2007. Plasma arc melting is a superior cold hearth melting process for making alloyed titanium products for jet engine rotating parts, medical applications, and other critical applications. VAR melting is a consumable electrode re melting process that improves the cleanliness and chemical homogeneity of the alloys. The Phase II expansion of ATIs titanium production capabilities was announced on March 17, 2006, and includes additional titanium sponge capacity at ATIs facility in Albany, OR, and an additional VAR furnace at ATIs facility in Bakers, NC. We expect the additional titanium sponge production capacity of approximately 4.0 million pounds annually from this phase to begin operation in the first half of 2007. The additional VAR melt capacity is expected to begin operation early in the third quarter 2007. The Phase III expansion of ATIs titanium production capabilities was announced on June 22, 2006, and includes additional titanium sponge capacity and an additional VAR furnace at ATIs facility in Albany, OR. The additional titanium sponge production capacity of approximately 4.0 million pounds annually from this phase is expected to be fully operational in the second half of 2007. As a result of Phases I, II and III, we expect our annual titanium sponge production capacity from the Albany facility to be approximately 12 million pounds in 2007, expanding to approximately 16 million pounds in 2008. The additional VAR melt capacity is expected to begin operations in two stages, with the first start up in the second quarter of 2007 and the second stage in the first quarter of 2008. In June 2006, we announced the Phase IV expansion to our titanium capabilities. Phase IV is a greenfield premium grade titanium sponge facility to be built in Rowley, UT with an annual capacity of 24 million pounds. This investment, which is estimated at $425 to $450 million including engineering and design for future expansion, is aimed at increasing our capacity to produce titanium alloys for aerospace and defense applications. Premium grade sponge is essential for many aerospace applications, including rotating quality titanium alloys used for new jet engines and spare parts. We expect initial production of titanium sponge to begin in the third quarter 2008 and grow to an initial annualized rate of 24 million pounds in 2009. In February 2007, we announced a further expansion of our Albany, OR titanium sponge production capabilities. The additional expansion of the Albany, OR facility will include four sponge furnaces and related processing operations, and is expected to be in service in the first half of 2008. This expansion is expected to add another 4 million pounds of titanium sponge capacity annually. Upon the completion of these phases, ATIs internal titanium sponge annual capacity of approximately 44 million pounds will be in addition to the amount of titanium sponge and titanium scrap ATI purchases from external sources. Additionally, in January 2007, we announced the expansion of our titanium and nickel based superalloy capabilities at facilities located in Bakers, NC. The purpose of the capital project is to meet growing demand from the aerospace and defense (both jet engine and airframe), electrical energy, medical, chemical process industry, and oil and gas markets. The total investment is approximately $215 million, which is expected to be nearly evenly spread over the next three years. ATI expects this self funded project to be substantially completed by the end of 2009. The project will include: Additional forging capacity. ATI plans to add an integrated 10,000 ton press forge, 700mm rotary forge, conditioning, finishing, and inspection facility to support increased forged product requirements. The new 28 Table of Contents forging capacity is expected to be operational by the third quarter 2009. Forging is a hot forming process that produces wrought forging billet and forged machining bar from an ingot. A fourth PAM furnace to support premium titanium alloy growth requirements. ATI expects this fourth PAM furnace to begin production by the fourth quarter 2008. Additional VAR capacity to support premium nickel based superalloy and titanium growth. ATI expects one new VAR to be in production in the first quarter 2008. The remaining four VAR furnaces would be installed as needed. 2005 Compared to 2004 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment increased 57% to $1.25 billion in 2005 primarily due to continuing strong demand from the aerospace, defense, oil and gas, medical, and power generation markets. Our exotic alloys business continued to benefit from demand from the aerospace, defense, chemical processing, and medical markets. Operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment improved significantly to $335.3 million as a result of increased shipments for most of our products, higher selling prices, and the benefits of gross cost reductions. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): Nickel based and specialty steel alloys 39,939 34,353 16 % Titanium mill products 24,882 22,012 13 % Exotic alloys 4,018 4,318 (7 %) Average Prices (per lb.): Nickel based and specialty steel alloys $ 11.25 $ 8.60 31 % Titanium mill products $ 22.75 $ 12.34 84 % Exotic alloys $ 40.38 $ 40.95 (1 %) Segment operating profit for 2005 and 2004 was adversely affected by higher raw material costs, which increased significantly in the past several years. These higher costs, while largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material indices, had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our LIFO inventory accounting methodology, resulting in LIFO inventory valuation reserve charges of $46.0 million in 2005, and $16.2 million in 2004. We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2005. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, for 2005 totaled approximately $34 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $20 million from operating efficiencies, $11 million from procurement, and $2 million from salaried and hourly labor cost savings. In 2005, we announced strategic capital investments to expand our titanium and nickel based alloy and specialty alloy production capabilities, which included approximately $110 million for: Upgrading and restarting approximately one half of the capacity of our idled titanium sponge facility in Albany, Oregon. Constructing a third plasma arc melt cold hearth furnace at ATI Allvacs North Carolina operations. Upgrading and expanding vacuum induction melt (VIM) capacity. VIM is a melting process designed for premium grades of nickel based alloys and superalloys that require more precise chemistry control and lower impurity levels. Installation of new electro slag re melt (ESR) and new VAR furnaces. ESR and VAR furnaces are consumable electrode re melting processes used to improve both the cleanliness and metallurgical structure of alloys. 29 Table of Contents Flat Rolled Products (In millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Sales to external customers $ 2,697.3 42 % $ 1,900.5 16 % $ 1,643.9 Operating income 344.3 130 % 149.9 144 % 61.5 Operating income as a percentage of sales 12.8 % 7.9 % 3.7 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 18.0 % 18.5 % 12.9 % Our Flat Rolled Products segment produces, converts and distributes stainless steel, nickel based alloys, and titanium and titanium based alloys, in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip products, as well as grain oriented silicon electrical steel sheet, and tool steels.

The remaining 50% interest in Uniti LLC is held by VSMPO, a Russian producer of titanium, aluminum, and specialty steel products. We account for the results of the Uniti joint venture using the equity method since we do not have a controlling interest. 2006 Compared to 2005 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2006 were $2.70 billion, or 42% higher than 2005, due primarily to increased volume, higher average base selling prices and higher average raw material surcharges. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): High value 502,524 495,868 1 % Commodity 889,105 652,870 36 % Total Flat Rolled Products 1,391,629 1,148,738 21 % Average Prices (per lb.): High value $ 2.50 $ 2.15 16 % Commodity $ 1.61 $ 1.26 28 % Total Flat Rolled Products $ 1.93 $ 1.64 18 % Shipments in 2006 increased by 21% to 1,392 million pounds compared to shipments of 1,149 million pounds for 2005. The average transaction prices to customers, which includes the effect of higher average raw material surcharges and higher average base selling prices, increased by 18% to $1.93 per pound in 2006. Our Flat Rolled Products segment high value product shipments, which include engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, super stainless steel, nickel based alloys, titanium and titanium based alloys, grain oriented silicon electrical steel, and tool steel products, increased 1%, with average transaction prices for our high value products increasing 16%, primarily due to product mix. Demand was strong for our specialty stainless, grain oriented silicon, titanium, and nickel based alloy products from the chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and aerospace and defense markets. Our direct international sales, which were primarily comprised of high value products, increased $134.7 million to $485.6 million, and represented 18% of sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment. Shipments of our commodity products, which primarily include stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, and stainless steel plate, increased 36% and average transaction prices for these products increased 28%. In 2006, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products increased approximately 15%, compared to 30 Table of Contents 2005 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). Demand was strong for our commodity products from the biofuel (ethanol) and construction markets and was good from the appliance and appliance related markets. Our The Switch is On marketing campaign had its best year ever in 2006 as customers in both the U.S. and Europe recognized the value of lean nickel products, such as AL201HP stainless, which has one half the nickel content as the most common Type 304 stainless product with similar corrosion properties and greater strength. In 2006, shipments of 201HP increased over 40% compared to 2005. In addition, we now sell other commodity stainless products in Europe, which demonstrates that we are a cost competitive global producer of these products.

The benefits of increased sales volume, higher average base selling prices, gross cost reduction initiatives, and additional surcharges offset significantly higher LIFO inventory valuation reserve charges due to higher raw material costs. During 2006, the average cost of our raw materials in our Flat Rolled Products segment increased approximately 49% compared to the 2005 average cost. As a result, for 2006 we recognized a charge of $147.3 million under the LIFO inventory costing methodology. In 2005, we recorded a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $8.9 million as a result of slightly lower raw material costs, compared to 2004. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our operations. In 2006, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $96 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $75 million from operating efficiencies, $11 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses, and $10 million from procurement savings. To support our strategic growth initiatives in the Flat Rolled Products segment, we committed to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities. In January 2007, we announced expansion of ATI Allegheny Ludlums titanium and specialty plate facility located in Washington, PA. The purpose of the capital project is to meet growing demand from the aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, and electrical energy markets for our Flat Rolled Products and High Performance Metals segments. We expect this investment to be approximately $60 million with completion planned for the second quarter 2008. The titanium and specialty plate capital project includes increasing reheat furnace, annealing, and flattening capacity at the existing plate mill. In addition, our plate size capabilities are being expanded and significant productivity improvements are being made. In 2006 we also announced the expansion of our STAL joint venture operations in Shanghai, China. This expansion, which is expected to more than triple STALs precision rolling and slitting capacity, is estimated to cost approximately $110 million. The expansion is expected to be fully operational in the 2009 first quarter and is expected to be funded through capital contributions from the joint venture partners, including a $25 million capital contribution by ATI, bank credit lines, and the internal cash flow of the joint venture. 2005 Compared to 2004 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2005 were $1.90 billion, or 16% higher than 2004, due primarily to higher average base selling prices and higher average raw material surcharges, partially offset by a decrease in demand in the second half of 2005. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): High value 495,868 508,946 (3 )% Commodity 652,870 666,560 (2 )% Total Flat Rolled Products 1,148,738 1,175,506 (2 )% Average Prices (per lb.): High value $ 2.15 $ 1.67 29 % Commodity $ 1.26 $ 1.18 7 % Total Flat Rolled Products $ 1.64 $ 1.39 18 % Our Flat Rolled Products segment high value product shipments, which include engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, super stainless steel, nickel alloy, titanium, grain oriented silicon electrical steel, and tool steel products, decreased 3%, while average transaction prices for our high value products increased 29%, primarily due to product mix. Shipments declined primarily due to softness in automotive markets partially offset by strong capital goods and power generation markets, especially in Asia. Our direct international sales, which were primarily comprised of high value products, increased $138.6 million to $350.9 million, and represented a record 18.5% of sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment. 34 Table of Contents Shipments of commodity products (including stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, and stainless steel plate, among other products) decreased 2% and average transaction prices for these products increased 7%. The decrease in shipments was primarily attributable to inventory adjustments in the second half of 2005 by service center customers primarily for stainless steel sheet. In 2005, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products decreased approximately 10%, compared to 2004 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). Demand from the capital goods markets such as chemical processing, oil and gas, and power generation markets remained strong throughout 2005. We experienced a weakening in demand from the automotive, construction and mining, and appliances markets. Operating income increased to $149.9 million for 2005 compared to $61.5 million in the 2004 period. The benefits of higher average base selling prices, cost reduction initiatives, additional surcharges, and a change in the LIFO inventory valuation reserve due to lower raw material costs, were partially offset by lower shipments and higher energy costs. During 2005, the average cost of our raw materials in our Flat Rolled Products segment decreased approximately 9% compared to the 2004 average cost. This compares to an increase of approximately 50% in 2004, compared to 2003. As a result, for 2005 we recognized a benefit of $8.9 million under the LIFO inventory costing methodology. In 2004, we recorded a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of approximately $86.5 million as a result of the higher raw material costs. Natural gas and electricity costs, net of natural gas hedges, for 2005 were approximately $39.5 million higher than 2004. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our operations. In 2005, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $85 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $24 million from operating efficiencies, $49 million from procurement, and $12 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses. At the end of 2005, we decided to indefinitely idle the West Leechburg, PA flat rolled products finishing facility, which occurred in stages during 2006. These restructuring charges of $17.5 million, plus charges of $8.5 million for fair market value adjustments of previously recognized asset impairments, are excluded from 2005 segment operating profit. In 2005, we announced $16 million in strategic capital programs to expand our titanium and nickel based alloy and specialty alloy production capabilities which include expanding high value plate products capacity by 25%, upgrading our flat rolled cold rolling assets used to produce titanium sheet and strip products, and expanding premium product re melting capacity. These projects are expected to be fully implemented in 2007. Acquisition of JL Specialty Steel LLC Assets On June 1, 2004, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of JL Specialty Steel LLC, a producer of flat rolled stainless steel products with operations in Midland, Pennsylvania and Louisville, Ohio, for $69.0 million in total consideration, including the assumption of certain current liabilities. The purchase price included $7.5 million cash paid at closing, the issuance to the seller of a non interest bearing $7.5 million promissory note paid on June 1, 2005, and the issuance to the seller of a promissory note in the principal amount of $54.0 million, which is subject to final adjustment, and secured by the property, plant and equipment acquired, payable in installments in 2007 through 2011, which bears interest at a London Inter bank Offered Rate plus a 1% margin, with a maximum interest rate of 6%. In connection with the JL asset acquisition, in June 2004 we reached a labor agreement with the USW, which represents employees at Allegheny Ludlum and at the former JL facilities. The agreement provided for a workforce restructuring through which we are achieving significant productivity improvements. Through a reduction in the number of job classifications and the implementation of flexible work rules, employees have been given broader responsibilities and the opportunity to become more involved in the business. The number of production and maintenance employees at the pre acquisition Allegheny Ludlum facilities was reduced by 650 employees, or approximately 25%, through an early retirement program over two and a half years pursuant to which the employees were offered transition incentives. Approximately 40% of these retirements occurred in second half of 2004, with over 70% of these retirements having taken place by the end of 2005, and 100% of these retirements were effective by the end of 2006. The acquisition of the JL assets and the negotiation of the progressive labor agreement in 2004 with the USW have continued to improve the performance of our Allegheny Ludlum business. 35 Table of Contents Engineered Products (In millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Sales to external customers $ 432.7 10 % $ 393.4 33 % $ 295.0 Operating profit 56.7 19 % 47.5 128 % 20.8 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 13.1 % 12.1 % 7.1 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 26.8 % 28.6 % 28.9 % Our Engineered Products segment includes the production of tungsten powder, tungsten heavy alloys, tungsten carbide materials and carbide cutting tools. The segment also produces carbon alloy steel impression die forgings, and large grey and ductile iron castings, and provides precision metals processing services. The operations in this segment are ATI Metalworking Products, ATI Portland Forge, ATI Casting Service and Rome Metals. On April 5, 2005, we acquired U.K. based Garryson Limited (Garryson), a leading producer of tungsten carbide burrs, rotary tooling and specialty abrasive wheels and discs. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and our results for ATI Metalworking Products include Garrysons sales and earnings from the acquisition date. The major markets served by our products of the Engineered Products Segment include a wide variety of industrial markets including automotive, chemical process industry, oil and gas, machine and cutting tools, construction and mining, aerospace, transportation, and wind power generation. 2006 Compared to 2005 Sales for the Engineered Products segment in 2006 increased 10%, to $432.7 million, and operating profit increased 19%, to $56.7 million, both compared to 2005. Demand for our tungsten products was strong from the oil and gas, construction and mining, aerospace and defense, and power generation markets. Demand was strong for our forged products from the transportation, construction and mining, and oil and gas markets. Demand for our cast products was strong from the wind energy, and transportation markets. Demand remained very strong for our titanium precision metal processing conversion services. The improvement in segment sales was primarily due to higher selling prices and increased volume, including shipments from our U.K. based ATI Garryson Limited cutting tool operations acquired in April 2005. Segment operating profit improved to $56.7 million in 2006, principally as a result of improved pricing and the benefits of cost reductions, which totaled $8.2 million. This improvement in operating profit was partially offset by the negative impact of higher raw material costs especially in the second half of the 2006 year. Operating profit included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $0.3 million in 2006 and a charge of $8.7 million in 2005 as a result of higher raw material costs and inventory levels. In 2006, we continued to invest to enhance our manufacturing capabilities and reduce costs. In the 2005 fourth quarter, we began a $17 million capital investment to expand our production capacity to internally source all of our ammonium paratungstate (APT) and cobalt requirements at what is expected to be significantly lower costs than purchased material. In addition, in 2006, we invested $4 million to expand our titanium precision metal conversion services operation as part our continuing strategic program to increase our overall titanium production capacity to better meet growing global demand. 2005 Compared to 2004 Sales for the Engineered Products segment in 2005 increased 33%, to $393.4 million, and operating profit increased 128%, to $47.5 million, both compared to 2004. Demand for our tungsten products was strong from the oil and gas, mining, and automotive markets. Demand remained strong for forgings from the Class 8 truck, and construction and mining markets. Demand for our cast products was strong from the transportation and wind energy markets. Demand was very strong for our titanium precision metal processing conversion services. The improvement in segment sales was primarily due to higher selling prices and increased volume, including shipments from our U.K. based ATI Garryson Limited cutting tool operations acquired in April 2005. Segment operating profit improved to $47.5 million in 2005, principally as a result of improved pricing and the benefits of cost reductions, which totaled $6.9 million. Operating profit included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of 36 Table of Contents $8.7 million in 2005 and a charge of $9.5 million in 2004 as a result of higher raw material costs and inventory levels. Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were 1.4% of sales, or $68.9 million, in 2006 compared to 1.5% of sales, or $51.7 million, in 2005 and 1.3% of sales, or $34.9 million, in 2004. The increase in corporate expenses in 2006 and 2005 was primarily the result of expenses associated with annual and long term performance based incentive compensation programs, partially offset by cost controls. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net of interest income, was $23.3 million for 2006 compared to $38.6 million for 2005, and $35.5 million for 2004. Interest expense is presented net of interest income of $15.0 million for 2006, $8.4 million for 2005, and $2.9 million for 2004. The increase in interest income for 2006 and 2005 primarily results from higher cash balances. Increased capital expenditures associated with strategic investments to expand our production capabilities resulted in higher interest capitalization in 2006. Interest expense in 2006, 2005, and 2004 was reduced by $4.5 million, $0.2 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, related to interest capitalization on capital projects. In prior years, we entered into receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts related to our $300 million, 8.375% 10 year Notes. In 2004, we terminated the remaining outstanding swap agreements and recognized a gain. The settlement gain is being amortized into income as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the 10 year Notes. Interest expense decreased by $1.7 million in 2006, $1.5 million in 2005, and $4.4 million in 2004 due to these settled interest rate swap agreements. Restructuring Costs and Curtailment Gain We had no restructuring costs or curtailment gains in 2006. We recorded restructuring costs of $23.9 million in 2005 and a curtailment gain, net of restructuring costs, of $40.4 million in 2004. In 2005, we recorded a restructuring charge of $23.9 million primarily related to recognizing an asset impairment charge for certain long lived assets in the Flat Rolled Products segment. At the end of 2005, we decided to indefinitely idle Allegheny Ludlums West Leechburg, PA flat rolled products finishing facility. The cost of indefinitely idling the facility was $17.3 million. The 2005 restructuring charge also included adjustments of previously recognized asset impairment charges for changes in estimated fair market values. We recorded $8.5 million of asset impairment charges associated with previously idled assets in the Flat Rolled Products segment at the Washington Flat Roll coil facility located in Washington, PA, and at the stainless steel plate facility located in Massillon, OH, partially offset by a $1.9 million reversal of previously recorded lease termination charges. In 2004, the curtailment gain, net of restructuring costs, of $40.4 million, includes the $71.5 million curtailment and settlement gain and the $25.3 million pension termination benefit charge discussed in Retirement Benefit Expense, below, and $5.8 million of restructuring charges. The restructuring charges related to the 2004 labor agreement at our Allegheny Ludlum operations and the JL asset acquisition, and included labor agreement costs of $4.6 million, severance costs of $0.7 million related to approximately 30 salaried employees, and $0.5 million for asset impairment charges for redundant equipment following the JL asset acquisition. At December 31, 2006, approximately $3 million of prior year workforce reduction and facility closure charges are future cash requirements that will be paid over the next several years. Cash to meet these obligations is expected to be paid from internally generated funds from operations. Other Expenses, Net of Gains on Asset Sales Other expenses, net of gains on asset sales, includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations, pretax gains and losses on the sale of surplus real estate, non strategic investments and other assets, operating results from 37 Table of Contents equity method investees, minority interest, and other non operating income or expense. These items are presented primarily in selling and administrative expenses, and in other income (expense) in the statement of income and resulted in net charges of $15.2 million in 2006 and $33.8 million in 2005, and other income of $2.5 million in 2004. Other expenses for 2006 primarily related to legal costs associated with closed operations. For 2005, other expenses included $26.8 million for legal matters and $7.0 million for environmental and other closed company costs. The charges for legal matters included the settlement of the Kaiser Aerospace Electronics matter, the unfavorable court judgment rendered in April 2005 concerning a commercial dispute with a raw materials supplier, both of which were paid in 2006, and other matters associated with closed companies, and are classified in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Retirement Benefit Expense Retirement benefit expense, which primarily includes pension and postretirement medical benefits, increased $4.3 million in 2006 due to the use of a lower assumed discount rate to value obligations and a lower level of postretirement medical benefit plan assets. In 2005 and 2004, retirement benefit expense declined, compared to the applicable preceding full year period, primarily as a result of higher than expected returns on pension assets during 2004 and 2003, actions taken in the second quarter 2004 to control retiree medical costs, and the favorable impact of the Medicare prescription drug legislation, partially offset by the use of progressively lower discount rate assumptions for determining benefit plan liabilities. Retirement benefit expense, excluding the effect of curtailment gains and termination benefit charges, was $81.9 million for 2006, $77.6 million for 2005, and $119.8 million for 2004. The effect of the Medicare prescription drug legislation, which provides for a Federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law, is recognized in operating results over a number of years. Retirement benefit expenses are included in both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses. Retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses for the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cost of sales $ 55.3 $ 55.1 $ 88.4 Selling and administrative expenses 26.6 22.5 31.4 Total retirement benefit expense $ 81.9 $ 77.6 $ 119.8 The 2004 retirement benefit expense shown above does not include the effects of the $71.5 million curtailment and settlement gain related to the elimination of retiree medical benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees beginning in 2010, nor does this expense include the $25.3 million charge related to the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) incentives associated with the 2004 labor agreement at Allegheny Ludlum, which was paid from our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. Total retirement benefit expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately $32 million, with effects on cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses similar to the percentages in 2006. Pension expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately $17 million, compared to $64 million in 2006, as higher than expected returns on pension assets in 2006 and the positive benefits of the voluntary $100 million 2006 pension contribution are partially offset by the use of a lower assumed discount rate to value pension liabilities. Postretirement medical expense for 2007 is expected to decrease to approximately $15 million, from $18 million in 2006, as higher than expected returns on plan assets in 2006 is partially offset by the use of a lower assumed discount rate to value obligations. Income Taxes Results of operations for 2006 included a provision for income taxes of $297.3 million, or 34.2% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The results for 2006 benefited from a favorable $8.7 million adjustment of prior years taxes. For 2005, results of operations included an income tax benefit of $54.7 million principally related to the reversal of the remaining valuation allowance for our U.S. Federal net deferred tax assets, partially offset by accruals for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. Results of operations for 2004 did not include an income tax provision or benefit for current or deferred taxes primarily as a result of the uncertainty regarding full utilization of the net deferred tax asset and available operating loss carryforwards. From the 2003 fourth quarter through the third quarter of 2005, we maintained a valuation allowance for a major portion of our U.S. 38 Table of Contents Federal deferred tax assets and certain state deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, due to uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax asset, including the 2003 and 2004 unutilized net operating losses. In the 2003 fourth quarter we had recorded a $138.5 million valuation allowance for the majority of our net deferred tax asset, based upon the results of our quarterly evaluation concerning the estimated probability that the net deferred tax asset would be realizable in light of our history of annual reported losses in the years 2001 through 2003. In 2005, we generated taxable income which exceeded the 2003 and 2004 net operating losses allowing us to fully realize these U.S. Federal tax benefits. This realization of tax benefits, together with our improved profitability, required us to eliminate the remaining valuation allowance for U.S. Federal income taxes in the 2005 fourth quarter. In 2004, we received $7.2 million in income tax refunds related to carrying back the previous years taxable loss to earlier years in which we had paid taxes. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. At December 31, 2006, we had a net deferred tax asset of $151.4 million. A significant portion of our deferred tax assets relates to the postretirement benefit obligations, which have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements but which are not recognized for income tax reporting purposes until the benefits are paid. These benefit payments are expected to occur over an extended period of years. Financial Condition and Liquidity We believe that internally generated funds, current cash on hand, and available borrowings under existing secured credit lines will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs, including a substantial expansion of our production capabilities over the next few years. We did not borrow funds under our domestic secured credit facility during 2006, 2005, or 2004. However, a portion of this secured credit facility is utilized to support letters of credit. Our ability to access the credit markets in the future to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be influenced by our credit rating. As of December 31, 2006, Standard Poors Ratings Services corporate credit rating for our Company was BB with a stable outlook. As of December 31, 2006, Moodys Investor Services corporate family rating for our Company was Ba2 with a stable outlook. Changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to, or the cost of, our existing credit facilities. We have no off balance sheet financing relationships with variable interest or structured finance entities. Cash Flow and Working Capital In 2006, cash generated by operations of $408.5 million, the proceeds from exercises of stock options of $33.1 million, and tax benefits on share based compensation of $80.9 million were used to invest $235.2 million in capital equipment, fund a $100 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, pay dividends of $43.1 million, repay debt of $7.1 million, and increase cash balances by $139.6 million to $502.3 million at December 31, 2006. In 2005, cash generated by operations of $322.6 million, the proceeds from exercises of stock options of $26.1 million, and tax benefits on share based compensation of $25.2 million were used to invest $90.1 million in capital equipment, fund a $100 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, pay $18.3 million for the acquisition of the Garryson Limited operation, repay debt of $25.7 million, pay dividends of $27.1 million, and increase cash balances by $111.9 million to $362.7 million at December 31, 2005. In 2004, cash generated from operations of $74.1 million, proceeds from sale of common stock of $229.7 million, proceeds from asset sales of $6.6 million, and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $7.6 million, were used to invest $49.9 million in capital equipment, fund a $50 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, pay $7.5 million of the purchase price for the JL assets, repay debt of $15.9 million, pay dividends of $21.2 million, and increase cash balances by $171.2 million to $250.8 million at December 31, 2004. We use cash flow from operations before voluntary pension plan contributions in order to evaluate and compare fiscal periods that do not include these contributions, and to make resource allocation decisions among operational requirements, investing and financing alternatives. 39 Table of Contents Managed Working Capital ($ millions) Managed Working Capital ($ millions) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Millions/$ 719 564 576 853 1,048 1,582 % of Annualized Revenue 36.8 % 32.4 % 30.7 % 29.5 % 30.3 % 29.0 % The favorable impact of improved operating results in 2006 and 2005 on cash flow from operations was offset by continuing investment in managed working capital to support the higher business levels and the effect of higher costs for certain raw materials. As part of managing the liquidity of the business, we focus on controlling inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. In measuring performance in controlling this managed working capital, we exclude the effects of the LIFO inventory valuation reserves, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which, due to their nature, are managed separately. During 2006, managed working capital, which we define as gross inventory plus accounts receivable less accounts payable, increased $534.2 million. This increase resulted from a $166.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales in the fourth quarter 2006 compared to the fourth quarter 2005, and a $409.2 million increase in inventory, mostly as a result of increased operating volumes and higher raw material costs, partially offset by a $41.5 million increase in accounts payable. Most of the increase in raw materials is expected to be recovered through surcharge and index pricing mechanisms. During 2005, managed working capital increased by $187.8 million, excluding working capital acquired as part of the Garryson Limited acquisition. This increase in managed working capital resulted from a $80.9 million increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales in the 2005 fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, and a $145.6 million increase in inventory mostly as a result of higher costs for certain raw materials and increased business volumes, partially offset by a $38.7 million increase in accounts payable. Managed working capital has increased $1.0 billion over the past four years as our level of business activity has significantly increased and raw material costs have increased. This increase in managed working capital is expected to represent a future source of cash if the level of business activity were to decline. Managed working capital as a percent of annualized sales declined to 29.0% at the end of 2006, compared to 30.3% at the end of 2005, 29.5% in 2004, and 30.7% in 2003. The decrease in 2006 of managed working capital 40 Table of Contents as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher business activity in the Flat Rolled Products segment, which has a shorter manufacturing cycle than our other business segments, and ATI Business System initiatives. While inventory and accounts receivable balances increased during this four year period, gross inventory turns, which exclude the effect of LIFO inventory valuation reserves, decreased slightly in 2006 after improving for the past three years, and days sales outstanding, which measures actual collection timing for accounts receivable, has steadily improved. The components of managed working capital were as follows: December 31, December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Accounts receivable, net $ 610.9 $ 442.1 $ 357.9 Inventory, net 798.7 607.1 513.0 Accounts payable (355.1 ) (312.9 ) (271.2 ) Subtotal 1,054.5 736.3 599.7 Allowance for doubtful accounts 5.7 8.1 8.4 LIFO reserve 466.7 269.7 223.9 Corporate and other 55.3 33.9 20.6 Managed working capital $ 1,582.2 $ 1,048.0 $ 852.6 Annualized prior 2 months sales $ 5,453.5 $ 3,461.1 $ 2,887.0 Managed working capital as a % of sales 29.0 % 30.3 % 29.5 % Capital expenditures for 2006 were $235.2 million, compared to $90.1 million in 2005 and $49.9 million for 2004. We have committed to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet current and expected demand growth from the aerospace (engine and airframe), defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, and medical markets, especially for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and specialty alloys. Our self funded investments include the following announced projects: A multi phase titanium products expansion that is expected to yield 44 million pounds of aerospace quality titanium sponge annual capacity and increase ATIs annual titanium melt capacity by at least 25 million pounds. The four phase expansion, which is expected to total approximately $625 million, includes the following: The Phase I expansion of ATIs titanium production capabilities was announced in July 2005, and includes upgrading and restarting ATIs titanium sponge facility in Albany, OR, constructing a third Plasma Arc Melt (PAM) cold hearth furnace in Bakers, NC, adding three vacuum arc remelt (VAR) furnaces, expanding high value plate products capacity by 25%, and continued upgrading of ATIs cold rolling assets used in producing titanium sheet and strip products. Phase I of our Albany, OR titanium sponge facility is now fully operational with six new furnaces producing at an annualized rate of approximately 8.0 million pounds, and the additional VAR melt capacity began operations in late 2006 and early 2007. The new PAM furnace is expected to begin operations in the first quarter 2007. Plasma arc melting is a superior cold hearth melting process for making alloyed titanium products for jet engine rotating parts, medical applications, and other critical applications. VAR melting is a consumable electrode re melting process that improves the cleanliness and chemical homogeneity of the alloys. The Phase II expansion of ATIs titanium production capabilities was announced in March 2006, and includes additional titanium sponge capacity at ATIs facility in Albany, OR, and an additional VAR furnace at ATIs facility in Bakers, NC. We expect the additional titanium sponge production capacity of approximately 4.0 million pounds annually from this phase to begin operation in the first half of 2007. The additional VAR melt capacity is expected to begin operation early in the third quarter 2007. The Phase III expansion of ATIs titanium production capabilities was announced in June 2006, and includes additional titanium sponge capacity and an additional VAR furnace at ATIs facility in Albany, OR. The additional titanium sponge production capacity of approximately 4.0 million pounds annually from this phase is expected to be fully operational in the second half of 2007. As a result of Phases I, II and III, we expect our annual titanium sponge production capacity from the Albany facility to be approximately 41 Table of Contents 12 million pounds in 2007, expanding to approximately 16 million pounds in 2008. The additional VAR melt capacity is expected to begin operations in two stages, with the first start up in the second quarter of 2007 and the second stage in the first quarter of 2008. In June 2006, we announced the Phase IV expansion to our titanium capabilities. Phase IV is a greenfield premium grade titanium sponge facility to be built in Rowley, UT with an annual capacity of 24 million pounds. This investment, which is estimated at $425 to $450 million including engineering and design for future expansion, is aimed at increasing our capacity to produce titanium alloys for aerospace and defense applications. Premium grade sponge is essential for many aerospace applications, including rotating quality titanium alloys used for new jet engines and spare parts. ATI expects initial production of titanium sponge to begin in the third quarter 2008, and grow to an initial annualized rate of 24 million pounds in 2009. In February 2007, we announced a further expansion of our Albany, OR titanium sponge production capabilities. The additional expansion of the Albany, OR facility will include four sponge furnaces and related processing operations, and is expected to be in service in the first half of 2008. This expansion is expected to add another 4 million pounds of titanium sponge capacity annually. Upon the completion of these phases, our internal titanium sponge annual capacity of approximately 44 million pounds will be in addition to the amount of titanium sponge and titanium scrap that we purchase from external sources. In January 2007, we announced the expansion of our titanium and nickel based superalloy capabilities at facilities located in Bakers, NC. The total investment is approximately $215 million, which is expected to be nearly evenly spread over the next three years and be substantially completed by the end of 2009. The project will include: Additional forging capacity. We plan to add an integrated 10,000 ton press forge, 700mm rotary forge, conditioning, finishing, and inspection facility to support increased forged product requirements. The new forging capacity is expected to be operational by the third quarter 2009. Forging is a hot forming process that produces wrought forging billet and forged machining bar from an ingot. A fourth PAM to support premium titanium alloy growth requirements. We expect this fourth PAM furnace to begin production by the fourth quarter 2008. Additional VAR capacity to support premium nickel based superalloy and titanium growth. We expect one new VAR to be in production in the first quarter 2008. The remaining four VAR furnaces would be installed as needed. A $60 million expansion of our titanium and specialty plate facility located in Washington, PA, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2008. In addition to titanium and titanium alloys, ATIs specialty plate products include duplex alloys, superaustenitic alloys, nickel based alloys, zirconium alloys, armor plate, and common austenitic stainless grades. Plate is a flat rolled mill product that is 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) thick, or greater, and over 10 inches (254 mm) wide. The project will include: Increasing reheat furnace, annealing, and flattening capacity at ATIs existing plate mill. In addition, ATIs plate size capabilities are being expanded and significant productivity improvements are being made. A $30 million expansion of our premium melt nickel based alloy, superalloy, and specialty alloy production capabilities to our capacity to produce these high performance alloys used for aero engine rotating parts, airframe applications, oil and gas exploration, extraction and refining, power generation land based turbines and flue gas desulfurization pollution control units, which was completed in early 2007. Major projects of this expansion, which increased our premium melt capacity by approximately 20%, included: 42 Table of Contents Upgrading and expanding vacuum induction melt (VIM) capacity. VIM is a melting process designed for premium grades with high alloy content that require more precise chemistry control and lower impurity levels. Installation of two new electro slag re melt (ESR) furnaces and three new VAR furnaces. ESR and VAR furnaces are consumable electrode re melting processes used to improve both the cleanliness and metallurgical structure of alloys. The above described strategic growth capital projects represent approximately $925 million of self funded capital investments, approximately $145 million of which had already been expended through 2006. We expect that our projected 2007 capital expenditures will be between $450 to $500 million, including $300 to $330 million for the above mentioned strategic capital projects. The remaining $450 to $480 million of the $925 million of strategic growth capital projects will be expended in 2008 and 2009, with the majority of the expenditures expected in 2008. Additionally, STAL, our Chinese joint venture company in which ATI has a 60% interest, commenced an expansion of its operations in Shanghai, China in late 2006. This expansion, which is expected to more than triple STALs precision rolling and slitting capacity, is estimated to cost approximately $110 million. The expansion is expected to be fully operational in the 2009 first quarter and is expected to be funded through capital contributions from the joint venture partners, bank credit lines, and the internal cash flow of the joint venture. Our cash contribution to this expansion is expected to be approximately $25 million, of which $12.4 million was contributed by ATI in the 2006 third quarter with the remainder anticipated to be contributed in the first half of 2007. The financial results of STAL are consolidated into our financial statements with the 40% interest of our minority partner recognized as other income or expense in the statements of income and as a liability in the statements of financial position. Debt Total debt outstanding decreased $6.8 million, to $553.6 million at December 31, 2006, from $560.4 million at December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily related to capital leases and financing on certain capital projects. In managing our overall capital structure, one of the measures on which we focus is net debt to total capitalization, which is the percentage of our debt, net of cash on hand, to our total invested and borrowed capital. In determining this measure, debt and total capitalization are net of cash on hand which may be available to reduce borrowings. Our net debt to total capitalization ratio improved to 3.3% at December 31, 2006, from 19.8% at December 31, 2005, and 43.8% at December 31, 2004. The lower ratio in 2006 results primarily from a continued increase in cash on hand and stockholders equity resulting from the improvement in results of operations. December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2006 2005 Total debt $ 553.6 $ 560.4 Less: Cash (502.3 ) (362.7 ) Net debt $ 51.3 $ 197.7 Net debt $ 51.3 $ 197.7 Total stockholders equity 1,492.6 799.9 Total capital $ 1,543.9 $ 997.6 Net debt to capital ratio 3.3 % 19.8 % We maintain a senior secured domestic revolving credit facility which is secured by all accounts receivable and inventory of our U.S. operations and includes capacity for up to $175 million of letters of credit. Under the facility, if undrawn availability, as defined in the facility, were to decline below $75 million, corporate actions that could be undertaken without the prior consent of the lending group, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, sales of assets, dividends, investments in, or loans to, corporations, partnerships, joint ventures and subsidiaries, issuance of unsecured indebtedness, leases, and prepayment of indebtedness, would be limited. The amended facility contains a financial covenant, which is not measured unless our undrawn availability is less than $75 million. This financial covenant, when measured, requires us to prospectively maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the credit facility) to fixed charges of at least 1.0 to 1.0 from the date the covenant is measured. Our ability to borrow under the amended secured credit facility in the future could be 43 Table of Contents adversely affected if we fail to maintain the applicable covenants under the agreement governing the facility. At December 31, 2006, we had the ability to access the entire $325 million undrawn availability under the facility, and the measurement of the financial covenant described above was 5.0 to 1.0. Interest rate swap contracts have been used from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. At December 31, 2006, we have no interest rate swap contracts in place. We have deferred gains on settled receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts associated with our $300 million, 8.375% Notes due 2011 (Notes). These gains on settlement, which occurred in 2004 and 2003, remain a component of the reported balance of the Notes, and are ratably recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes, which is approximately five years. At December 31, 2006, the deferred settlement gain was $10.5 million. The result of the receive fixed, pay floating arrangements was a decrease in interest expense of $1.7 million, $1.5 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, compared to the fixed interest expense of the ten year Notes.

We used current market prices as of December 31, 2006, for raw material obligations with variable pricing. (C) We have various contractual obligations that extend through 2015 for services involving production facilities and administrative operations. Our purchase obligation as disclosed represents the estimated termination fees payable if we were to exit these contracts. (D) Drawn amounts, if any, are included in total debt. There are no drawn amounts at December 31, 2006. Includes $119.5 million utilized under the $325 million domestic secured credit facility for standby letters of credit, which renew annually and are used to support: $72.5 million of financing outside of the domestic secured credit facility, primarily for our foreign based operations; $38.5 million in workers compensation and general insurance arrangements; and $8.5 million related to legal, environmental and other matters. Retirement Benefits We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158) on December 31, 2006. FAS 158 requires that the net funded position of the plans, as measured by the projected benefit obligation (PBO) in the case of pension plans, and by the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) in the case of other postretirement benefit plans, be recognized as an asset or liability in the employers balance sheet. As required under the accounting rules which 44 Table of Contents existed prior to adoption of the new standard, we recognized an increase to stockholders equity of $389.8 million at year end 2006 primarily as a result of the improved funded position of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Simultaneously, the adoption of FAS 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of $342.6 million, which is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The net effect of both of these adjustments was an increase in stockholders equity of $47.2 million. These charges and adjustments did not affect our results of operations and do not have a cash impact. In addition, they do not affect compliance with debt covenants in our bank credit agreement. We were not required to make cash contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan for 2006, 2005 or 2004. During the fourth quarter 2006 and 2005, and the third quarter 2004, we made voluntary contributions to this defined benefit pension plan of $100 million, $100 million and $50 million, respectively, to improve the plans funded position. Based on current regulations and actuarial studies, we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for at least the next several years. We may elect, depending upon investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. We fund certain retiree health care benefits for Allegheny Ludlum using investments held in a Company administered Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) trust. This allows us to recover a portion of the retiree medical costs. In accordance with our labor agreements, during 2006, 2005, and 2004, we funded $28.3 million, $24.7 million, and $18.2 million, respectively, of retiree medical costs using the investments of the VEBA trust. We may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the investments held in the VEBA. The value of the investments held in the VEBA was approximately $93 million as of November 30, 2006, our measurement date for accounting purposes. Dividends We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock for each of the first three quarters of 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors increased the cash dividend paid on our common stock to $0.13 per share. During 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share of common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2005, our Board of Directors increased the cash dividend paid on our common stock to $0.10 per share. The payment of dividends and the amount of such dividends depends upon matters deemed relevant by our Board of Directors, such as our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by credit agreements or senior securities, and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate. Critical Accounting Policies The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when title passes or as services are rendered. We have no significant unusual sale arrangements with any of our customers. We market our products to a diverse customer base, principally throughout the United States. Trade credit is extended based upon evaluations of each customers ability to perform its obligations, which are updated periodically. Accounts receivable reserves are based upon an aging of accounts and a review for collectibility of specific accounts. Accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $5.7 million at December 31, 2006 and $8.1 million at December 31, 2005, which represented 0.9% and 1.8%, respectively, of total gross accounts receivable. During 2006, we wrote off $1.7 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve, and also reduced expense by $0.7 million from decreasing the reserve for doubtful accounts. During 2005, we recognized expense of $1.7 million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off $2.0 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve. 45 Table of Contents Inventories At December 31, 2006, we had net inventory of $798.7 million. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last in, first out (LIFO), first in, first out (FIFO) and average cost methods) or market, less progress payments. Costs include direct material, direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs. Most of our inventory is valued utilizing the LIFO costing methodology. Inventory of our non U.S. operations is valued using average cost or FIFO methods. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have been extremely volatile during the past three years. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rapid rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results. For example, in 2006, 2005, and 2004, the effect of the increase in raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which was $197.0 million, $45.8 million, and $112.2 million higher, respectively, than would have been recognized if we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. In a period of rising prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Conversely, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. We evaluate product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value. The calculation of a resulting reserve, if any, is recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified. At December 31, 2006, no such reserves were required. It is our general policy to write down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months. In some instances this criterion is up to twenty four months due to the longer manufacturing and distribution process for such products. Asset Impairment We monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets. An impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an assets use (including any proceeds from disposition) are less than the assets carrying value, and the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Changes in the expected use of a long lived asset group, and the financial performance of the long lived asset group and its operating segment, are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment. Future cash flow value may include appraisals for property, plant and equipment, land and improvements, future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets, and other operating considerations. At December 31, 2006, we had $206 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. Changes in the goodwill balance from 2005 are due to foreign currency translation. Of the total, $112 million related to the Flat Rolled Products segment, $68 million related to the High Performance Metals segment, and $26 million related to the Engineered Products segment. Goodwill is required to be reviewed annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The impairment test for goodwill is a two step process. The first step is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If this comparison reflects impairment, then the loss would be measured as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. Implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of all recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment during the fourth quarter. Our evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment includes estimating the fair market value of each of the reporting units that have goodwill associated with their operations using discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings valuation techniques, plus valuation comparisons to recent public sale transactions of similar businesses, if any. These valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results, cash flows including changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and the cost of capital. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions used were reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. No goodwill impairment was determined to exist for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004. 46 Table of Contents Contingencies When it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired, we recognize a loss if the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants, and disposal of wastes, and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. We could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party sites. With respect to proceedings brought under the Federal Superfund laws, or similar state statutes, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at approximately 28 of such sites, excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability. Our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately 21 of these sites, and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining 7 individual sites is not considered to be material. We are a party to various cost sharing arrangements with other PRPs at the sites. The terms of the cost sharing arrangements are subject to non disclosure agreements as confidential information. Nevertheless, the cost sharing arrangements generally require all PRPs to post financial assurance of the performance of the obligations or to pre pay into an escrow or trust account their share of anticipated site related costs. In addition, the Federal government, through various agencies, is a party to several such arrangements. Environmental liabilities are recorded when our liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable. In many cases, we are not able to determine whether we are liable or, if liability is probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. Estimates of our liability are further subject to additional uncertainties including the nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the participation, number and financial condition of other PRPs. We intend to adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments. At December 31, 2006, our reserves for environmental matters totaled approximately $25 million. Accruals for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not take into account the effects of inflation, and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. The accruals are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties, but do reflect allocations among PRPs at Federal Superfund sites or similar state managed sites after an assessment is made of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites and after appropriate cost sharing or other agreements are entered. Our measurement of environmental liabilities is based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations, and current technology. Such estimates take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation, the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities, and the professional judgment of our environmental experts in consultation with outside environmental specialists, when necessary. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the matters with which we are currently associated (either individually or in the aggregate) will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters, however, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Retirement Benefits We have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans covering substantially all of our employees. In the fourth quarter 2006 and 2005, and in third quarter 2004, we made voluntary cash contributions of $100 million, $100 million and $50 million, respectively, to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to improve the plans funded position. We are not required to make a contribution to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2007, and, based upon current regulations and actuarial analyses, we do not expect to be required to make cash 47 Table of Contents contributions to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for at least the next several years. However, we may elect, depending upon the investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (FAS 87), as amended by FAS 158 regarding the balance sheet presentation of pension assets and liabilities. FAS 87 requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. A significant element in determining our pension (expense) income in accordance with FAS 87 is the expected investment return on plan assets. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration input from our third party pension plan asset managers and actuaries regarding the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. Our expected return on pension plan investments is 8.75%. We apply this assumed rate to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension (expense) income for the current year. The actual return on pension plan assets was 18.2% for 2006, 9.7% for 2005, 11.7% for 2004, and 13.1% for 2003. While the actual return on pension plan investments has exceeded the expected return on pension plan investments for each of the past four years, our expected return on pension plan investments for 2007 remains at 8.75%. The effect of increasing, or lowering, the expected return on pension plan investments by 0.25% results in additional annual income, or expense, of approximately $5.4 million. The cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods. The amount of expected return on plan assets can vary significantly from year to year since the calculation is dependent on the market value of plan assets as of the end of the preceding year. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to calculate the expected return on pension assets using either an average of fair market values of pension assets over a period not to exceed five years, which reduces the volatility in reported pension income or expense, or their fair market value at the end of the previous year. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission currently does not permit companies to change from the fair market value at the end of the previous year methodology, which is the methodology that we use, to an averaging of fair market values of plan assets methodology. As a result, our results of operations and those of other companies, including companies with which we compete, may not be comparable due to these different methodologies in calculating the expected return on pension investments. At the end of November of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to value pension plan liabilities. In accordance with FAS 87, the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. In estimating this rate, we receive input from our actuaries regarding the rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments with maturities matched to the expected future retirement benefit payments. Based on this assessment at the end of November 2006, we established a discount rate of 5.8% for valuing the pension liabilities as of the end of 2006, and for determining the pension expense for 2007. We had previously assumed a discount rate of 5.9% for 2005, which determined the 2006 expense, 6.1% for 2004, which determined the 2005 expense, and 6.5% for 2003, which determined the 2004 expense. The effect of lowering the discount rate to 5.8%, from 5.9% in the previous year, increased pension liabilities by approximately $22 million at 2006 year end, and is expected to increase pension expense by approximately $3.5 million in 2007. The effect on pension liabilities for changes to the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, are deferred and amortized over future periods in accordance with FAS 87. We adopted FAS 158 as of fiscal year end 2006. FAS 158 requires that the net funded position of the plans, as measured by the projected benefit obligation (PBO) in the case of pension plans, and by the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) in the case of other postretirement benefit plans, be recognized as an asset or liability in the employers balance sheet. Prior period information is not restated. In addition, the new standard will require assets and benefits to be measured at the date of our statement of financial position, which is December 31, rather than our measurement date of November 30, as currently permitted. This change will be effective for our 2008 fiscal year. Prior to the adoption of FAS 158, the funded status of pension plans was measured by the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO). At the November 30, 2006, measurement date, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was overfunded on an ABO basis, and we reversed the previously recorded minimum pension liability and 48 Table of Contents accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with this plan when it had been in an ABO underfunded position, recorded a prepaid pension cost asset of $569.9 million, and increased stockholders equity by $389.8 million, net of related deferred tax effects. However, on a PBO basis, which is the funded status measure required by FAS 158, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by $5.6 million at the measurement date. For our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, the adoption of FAS 158 eliminated the $569.9 million prepaid pension cost, established a $5.6 million noncurrent liability, and reduced stockholders equity by $345.3 million, net of related deferred tax effects. We also sponsor other non qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K., and several postretirement benefit plans. Including these other pension and postretirement benefit plans, the aggregate effect of adopting FAS 158 reduced stockholders equity by $342.6 million, net of related deferred tax effects, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The net effect of these adjustments was an increase in stockholders equity of $47.2 million. These charges and adjustments did not affect our results of operations and do not have a cash impact. In addition, they do not affect compliance with debt covenants in our bank credit agreement. We also sponsor several postretirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees and retirees. These plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Under most of the plans, our contributions towards premiums are capped based upon the cost as of a certain date, thereby creating a defined contribution. For the non collectively bargained plans, we maintain the right to amend or terminate the plans in the future. We account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAS 106), as amended by FAS 158 regarding the balance sheet display of pension and other postretirement benefits obligations assets and liabilities, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as benefits are paid. We use actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for the plans. The discount rate, which is determined annually at the end of November of each year, is developed based upon rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. At the end of 2006, we determined this rate to be 5.8%, a reduction from a 5.9% discount rate in 2005, 6.1% discount rate in 2004 and 6.50% in 2003. The effect of lowering the discount rate to 5.8% from 5.9% increased 2006 postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $3 million, compared to the prior year, and 2007 expenses are expected to increase by approximately $0.5 million. Based upon predictions of continued significant medical cost inflation in future years, the annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits for health care plans is 10.0% for 2007 and is assumed to gradually decrease to 5.0% in the year 2016 and remain level thereafter. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act provides for a federal subsidy, with tax free payments commencing in 2006, to sponsors of retiree health care benefits plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by the law. The federal subsidy included in the law resulted in a reduction of our other postretirement benefits obligation of approximately $70 million, which will be recognized in operating results over a number of years as an actuarial experience gain. As a result of this reduction of our other postretirement benefits obligation, our 2006 and 2005 postretirement benefit expense was reduced by approximately $10 million in each year. Certain of these postretirement benefits are funded using plan investments held in a Company administered VEBA trust. The expected return on plan investments is a significant element in determining postretirement benefits expenses in accordance with FAS 106. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. For 2006, our expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 9%. This assumed long term rate of return on investments is applied to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan investments that is included in annual postretirement benefits expenses for the current year. While the actual return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 50.0% in 2006, 11.6% in both 2005 and 2004, and 9.3% for 2003, our expected return on investments in the VEBA trust remains 9% for 2007. The expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust is expected to exceed the return on pension plan investments due to a higher percentage of private equity investments held by the VEBA trust. 49 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS 158, an amendment to its standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting. The new standard requires that the net funded position of the plans, as measured by the projected benefit obligation in the case of pension plans, and by the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation in the case of other postretirement benefit plans, be recognized as an asset or liability in the employers balance sheet. As required under the accounting rules which existed prior to adoption of the new standard, we recognized an increase to stockholders equity of $389.8 million at year end 2006 primarily as a result of the improved funded position of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. Simultaneously, the adoption of FAS 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of $342.6 million, which is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The net effect of both of these adjustments was an increase in stockholders equity of $47.2 million. In addition, the new standard will require assets and benefits to be measured at the date of the employers statement of financial position, which is December 31 in our case, rather than our measurement date of November 30, as currently permitted. This change will be effective for ATIs 2008 fiscal year. The FASB issued, in September 2006, a FASB Staff Position (FSP) titled Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities (FSP PMMA). This FSP amends an AICPA Industry Audit guide and is applicable to all industries that accrue for planned major maintenance activities. The FSP PMMA prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities, which is the policy we used to record planned plant outage costs on an interim basis within a fiscal year, and also to record the costs of major equipment rebuilds which extend the life of capital equipment. The FSP PMMA is effective as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Under the FSP PMMA, we will report results using the deferral method whereby major equipment rebuilds are capitalized as costs are incurred and amortized into expense over their estimated useful lives, and planned plant outage costs are fully recognized in the interim period of the outage. The adoption of the FSP PMMA on January 1, 2007, resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $12.2 million, net of related taxes. Retrospectively applied, our net income for 2006, 2005 and 2004 increased $2.1 million, $2.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, or approximately $0.02 per share for each year. Beginning with the 2007 first quarter, ATIs financial statements will reflect this FSP for all periods, as if it had been applied to the earliest period presented. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes recognition and measurement standards for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is the determination of whether a tax position should be recognized in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is to be recognized only if we determine that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based upon the technical merits of the position. In step two for those tax positions which should be recognized, the measurement of a tax position is determined as being the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 was effective for the beginning of ATIs 2007 fiscal year, with adoption treated as a cumulative effect type reduction to retained earnings in the range of $10 million as of the beginning of 2007. In the fourth quarter 2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS 143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. An entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated, even if conditional on a future event. For existing asset retirement obligations which are determined to be recognizable under FIN 47, the effect of applying FIN 47 is recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Our adoption of FIN 47 resulted in recognizing a charge of $2.0 million, net of income taxes, or $0.02 per share, in the fourth quarter 2005 principally for estimable asset retirement obligations related to remediation costs which would be incurred if we were to cease certain manufacturing activities which utilize what may be categorized as potentially hazardous materials. 50 Table of Contents In the first quarter 2005, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Under this revised standard, companies may no longer account for share based compensation transactions, such as stock options, restricted stock, and potential payments under programs such as our Total Shareholder Return Program (TSRP) awards, using the intrinsic value method as defined in APB Opinion No. 25. Instead, companies are required to account for such equity transactions using an approach in which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. Compensation expense is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not satisfied. However, compensation expense already recognized is not adjusted if market conditions are not met, such as our total shareholder return performance relative to a peer group under our TSRP awards, or for stock options expiring out of the money. We adopted the new standard using the modified prospective method, in which the effect of the standard is recognized in the period of adoption and in future periods. Prior periods are not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard at earlier dates. Forward Looking Statements From time to time, the Company has made and may continue to make forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements in this report relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, would, should, will, will likely result, forecast, outlook, projects, and similar expressions. Such forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which the Company is unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results or performance to materially differ from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such statements. Various of these factors are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and will be described from time to time in the Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Companys Annual Reports on Form 10 K and the Companys subsequent reports filed with the SEC on Form 10 Q and Form 8 K, which are available on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov and on the Companys website at http://www.alleghenytechnologies.com. We assume no duty to update our forward looking statements. 51 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. We attempt to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $78 million of floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.1%. Approximately $54 million of this floating rate debt is capped at a 6% maximum interest rate, and at December 31, 2006, was bearing interest at the capped 6% rate. Since the interest rate on floating rate debt changes with the short term market rate of interest, we are exposed to the risk that these interest rates may increase, raising our interest expense in situations where the interest rate is not capped. For example, a hypothetical 1% in rate of interest on the $24 million of our outstanding floating rate debt not subjected to a cap would result in increased annual financing costs of $0.2 million. Volatility of Energy Prices. Energy resources markets are subject to conditions that create uncertainty in the prices and availability of energy resources. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, have and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We use approximately 10 to 12 million MMBtus of natural gas annually, depending upon business conditions, in the manufacture of our products. These purchases of natural gas expose us to risk of higher gas prices. For example, a hypothetical $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of approximately $10 to $12 million. We use several approaches to minimize any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations from volatile energy prices. These approaches include incorporating an energy surcharge on many of our products and using financial derivatives to reduce exposure to energy price volatility. Volatility of Raw Material Prices. We use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of increased raw material costs; however, competitive factors in the marketplace can limit our ability to institute such mechanisms, and there can be a delay between the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefit of such mechanisms. For example, since we generally use in excess of 85 million pounds of nickel each year, a hypothetical change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately $85 million. In addition, we also use in excess of 800 million pounds of ferrous scrap in the production of our products and a hypothetical change of $0.01 per pound would result in increased costs of approximately $8 million. While we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations, such as for nickel, we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure. We believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts, but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials. 52 Table of Contents
