Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements. Actual results or performance could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described below. Overview of 2007 Financial Performance In 2007, we strengthened our position in key global growth markets, launched new production facilities, and solidified our balance sheet while achieving record sales and profits. Net income for the full year 2007 increased 30% to $747.1 million, or $7.26 per share, compared to $574.1 million, or $5.61 per share, for 2006. For 2007, return on capital employed was 31.2%, and return on stockholders equity was 40.1%. Sales increased 10.5% to $5.45 billion for 2007. Direct international sales increased $294.8 million, or 25%, and represented 27% of our total sales. Our growth is being driven by demand from the aerospace and defense market and strong demand from those markets that are vital to the building and rebuilding of the global infrastructure. For 2007, 31% of our sales were to the aerospace and defense market, 24% to the chemical process industry and oil and gas markets, 13% to the electrical energy market, and 3% to the medical market. These major high value growing global markets represented 71% of ATIs 2007 sales. In our High Performance Metals segment, year over year sales increased 14% to $2.07 billion due primarily to demand from the aerospace and defense, and oil and gas markets for our titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys. In addition, sales benefited from the continued strong demand for our exotic materials, especially from the aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, and electrical energy markets. Operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment improved to $729.1 million, an 11% increase compared to 2006, due primarily to higher shipments resulting from increased demand, higher average selling prices for nickel based alloys, specialty alloys and exotic alloys, and benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts. Lower raw material costs, primarily titanium scrap, resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of $96.3 million for 2007 compared to a LIFO inventory valuation charge in 2006 of $49.4 million. In our Flat Rolled Products segment, sales increased 9% to $2.95 billion primarily as a result of improved product mix, higher average base selling prices and raw material surcharges. While demand for our specialty and titanium sheet, and grain oriented electrical steel products was strong from the global electrical energy, oil and gas, and chemical process industry markets, shipments of our standard stainless products declined primarily due to U.S. and European service center customers destocking actions, and concerns by other customers due to the volatility of raw material surcharges as a result of the extreme volatility in the cost of nickel throughout most of 2007. Total Flat Rolled Products shipments declined 25%, with shipments of standard stainless products declining 37%. Even with the decline in shipments, operating profit for the Flat Rolled Products segment was a record $505.2 million, a 45% increase compared to 2006. This improvement in 2007 operating profit was due primarily to improved product mix, higher average base selling prices, and the benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts. Increased raw material costs, partially offset by lower inventory quantities, resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation charge of $1.9 million for 2007 compared to a LIFO inventory valuation charge of $147.3 million in 2006. In our Engineered Products segment, 2007 sales were comparable to prior year at $433.0 million. However, operating profit declined to $32.1 million, compared to $56.7 million in 2006, primarily due to higher purchased raw material costs, and start up costs associated with our newly expanded ammonium paratungstate (APT) plant, including the slower than planned ramp up of this plant. For 2007, total segment operating profit increased 19% to $1.27 billion, an increase of $204.5 million compared to 2006. Total segment operating profit as a percentage of total sales reached a record 23.2% in 2007, compared to 21.5% in 2006. During 2007, we continued to enhance our leading market positions, reduce costs, and improve our balance sheet. We also realized continued success in implementing the ATI Business System, which is continuing to drive lean manufacturing throughout our operations. Our accomplishments during 2007 from these important efforts included: We continued to grow our global market presence as direct international sales reached a record $1.47 billion, or 27% of total sales, an increase of $294.8 million compared to 2006. We believe that nearly 50% of ATIs 2007 sales were driven by global markets when we consider exports of our customers. We continued to build a foundation for further profitable growth. During second half 2007, we entered into additional long term agreements with customers for our titanium and titanium alloy, nickel based alloy, specialty alloy, grain oriented electrical steel, and iron castings products. These contracts build upon agreements announced earlier in 2007 and in the second half of 2006 with 21 Table of Contents The Boeing Company and GE Aviation to supply these aerospace and defense customers with titanium and nickel based superalloys. We believe these agreements indicate that long term supply of these products remained critically important to our customers. We continued to realize significant benefits of our strategic focus for high value specialty products, especially titanium. In 2007, shipments of titanium products, including ATI produced products for our Uniti titanium joint venture, increased 15% to approximately 41 million pounds. For 2008, we currently expect shipments of titanium products to increase an additional 25% to over 50 million pounds. These volume increases are being achieved utilizing our manufacturing capabilities across both our High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products segments and demonstrate our ability to supply the marketplace with both long and flat rolled products. We significantly increased self funded strategic capital investments in our businesses to support the growth in our markets, especially for titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys. During the past three years, we have invested over $800 million, of which $457.1 million was spent in 2007, to expand our titanium sponge production, and our melting, rolling and finishing capabilities. Our major strategic capital projects include: A significant upgrade to and restarting of our titanium sponge facility in Albany, OR, at a total capital investment of approximately $100 million, including the announced expansion in February 2007. Titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products. The annual production of titanium sponge from our Albany, OR facility achieved an annualized production rate of approximately 16 million pounds at the end of 2007, and is expected to reach approximately 22 million pounds of annualized production by the second half of 2008 when all phases are completed. The design and construction of a greenfield premium grade titanium sponge facility in Rowley, UT, which will be the first greenfield titanium sponge facility built in the U.S. in over thirty years. The estimated cost of this facility is expected to be approximately $460 million, including engineering and design for future expansion. Titanium sponge production from the Rowley, UT facility is expected to begin in late 2008 and reach an initial annualized production rate of approximately 24 million pounds in 2009. When the Oregon and Utah facilities are operational in 2009, our total annual titanium sponge production capacity is expected to be approximately 46 million pounds, and is intended to supplement our purchased titanium sponge and purchased titanium scrap requirements. The Utah facility could be expanded to a total annual capacity of 42 million pounds with additional capital investment if market conditions warrant such an investment. The design and construction of a titanium alloys and nickel based alloys and superalloy forging facility at our operations in North Carolina at an estimated cost of $237 million. This new facility, which is expected to be constructed in phases through 2009, will include a new 10,000 ton press forge and a new 700mm rotary forge, both of which will be the largest of their kind in the world for producing these types of alloys. It will also include billet conditioning and finishing equipment. We will also add our fourth Plasma Arc Melt (PAM) furnace for cold hearth melting premium titanium alloys, primarily for aeroengine rotating quality applications, and we will build additional vacuum arc remelt (VAR) capacity to support premium nickel based superalloy and titanium growth. These investments are expected to commence production in phases through 2009 and into 2010. A $60 million upgrade and expansion of our titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys, stainless steel, and specialty alloys plate finishing facility in Washington, PA. This upgrade and expansion is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2008. A significant expansion of our capability to produce ammonium paratungstate (APT), a raw material used in the production of tungsten powder and tungsten based cutting tools and other products in our Engineered Products segment. This investment was completed in 2007 and is now fully operational. This investment is expected to position ATI to be self sufficient for APT, by producing this important raw material from scrap at a much lower cost than purchased APT. Our Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), in which ATI has a 60% interest, commenced an expansion of its Precision Rolled Strip operations in Shanghai, China. This expansion is expected to more than triple STALs precision rolling and slitting capacity when fully operational in 2009. For 2008, we currently plan to spend approximately $500 million for capital expenditures, excluding the capital expansion underway at our STAL joint venture. 22 Table of Contents We realized strong cash generation in 2007. Cash on hand at the end of 2007 was $623 million, an increase of $121 million compared to the end of 2006. This increase in cash is after investing $457 million in capital expenditures and purchases of businesses, $44 million in managed working capital due primarily to higher business activity, $100 million in a voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, $61 million to repurchase ATI stock, and $58 million in dividend payments. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet. At the end of 2007, ATI had more cash than debt. Therefore, our net debt to total capitalization improved to a negative 4.5% compared to a positive 3.3%, 19.7%, 43.5% and 71.7% at year end 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total debt to total capital declined to 19.2% compared to 26.9%, 41.0%, 57.5%, and 74.9% at year end 2006, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. At the end of 2007, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was 111% funded. This is significant as the funded status of the plan prior to 2006 had a significant negative impact on our balance sheet. As a result of the improvement in funding status, total retirement benefit expense is expected to decline by $29 million in 2008, compared to 2007. We continued to realize significant progress in safety across ATIs operations. As a result of our continuing focus on and commitment to safety, in 2007 our OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate improved by 5% to 3.02 and our Lost Time Case Rate was 0.52, which we believe to be competitive with world class performance. We realized continued success from the ATI Business System, which is continuing to drive lean manufacturing throughout our operations. In addition to the improved safety performance discussed above, we realized $112 million in gross cost reductions in 2007 which exceeded our goal of $100 million. We have targeted additional gross cost reductions of $100 million in 2008. With the continuing strength in our major end markets and confidence in ATIs ability to continue to generate strong cash flow over the next several years, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by nearly 40% to $0.18 per share in November 2007. This is the third consecutive year the Board has significantly increased the dividend. Additionally in November 2007, the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. As a result of these accomplishments, we believe our long term profitable growth outlook remains intact. With our new production capabilities and our strong financial position, we believe ATI is well positioned to continue to expand our presence in the growing global markets that have been driving our performance over the last several years. We expect demand from the commercial aerospace market to remain at a high level as our airframe and jet engine customers backlogs are at record levels. We also expect demand from the chemical process industry, oil and gas, and electrical energy markets to stay strong as the global infrastructure build and rebuild continues. Results of Operations Sales were $5.45 billion in 2007, $4.94 billion in 2006 and $3.54 billion in 2005. Direct international sales represented approximately 27% of 2007 sales, 24% of 2006 sales and 25% of 2005 sales. Segment operating profit was $1.27 billion in 2007, $1.06 billion in 2006, and $536.7 million in 2005. Our measure of segment operating profit, which we use to analyze the performance and results of our business segments, excludes income taxes, corporate expenses, net interest expense, retirement benefit expense, other costs net of gains on asset sales and restructuring costs, if any. We believe segment operating profit, as defined, provides an appropriate measure of controllable operating results at the business segment level. Income before tax and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $1.15 billion in 2007, $872.6 million in 2006, and $311.1 million in 2005. For 2005, income before tax included a restructuring charge of $23.9 million for asset impairments and a charge of $12.6 million for legal matters. Net income was $747.1 million for 2007, $574.1 million for 2006, and $362.4 million for 2005. Net income for 2005 included a $20.9 million net special gain, which included a tax benefit associated with the reversal of the Companys remaining valuation allowance for U.S. Federal net deferred tax assets, partially offset by asset impairment charges in the Flat Rolled Products segment, charges for legal matters, and the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle for conditional asset retirement obligations. 23 Table of Contents We operate in three business segments: High Performance Metals, Flat Rolled Products and Engineered Products. These segments represented the following percentages of our total revenues and segment operating profit for the years indicated: 2007 2006 2005 Operating Operating Operating Revenue Profit Revenue Profit Revenue Profit High Performance Metals 38 % 58 % 37 % 62 % 35 % 62 % Flat Rolled Products 54 % 40 % 54 % 33 % 54 % 29 % Engineered Products 8 % 2 % 9 % 5 % 11 % 9 % Information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. High Performance Metals (In millions) 2007 % Change 2006 % Change 2005 Sales to external customers $ 2,067.6 14 % $ 1,806.6 45 % $ 1,246.0 Operating profit 729.1 11 % 657.2 96 % 335.1 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 35.3 % 36.4 % 26.9 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 32.0 % 31.3 % 32.3 % Our High Performance Metals segment produces, converts and distributes a wide range of high performance alloys, including titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel and cobalt based alloys and superalloys, exotic alloys such as zirconium, hafnium, niobium, nickel titanium, and their related alloys, and other specialty metals, primarily in long product forms such as ingot, billet, bar, rod, wire, shapes and rectangles, and seamless tube. These products are designed for the high performance requirements of such major end markets as aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy and medical. The operating units in this segment are ATI Allvac, ATI Allvac Ltd (U.K.) and ATI Wah Chang. 2007 Compared to 2006 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment for 2007 increased 14% to $2.07 billion, due primarily to improved volume and higher average selling prices for our nickel based alloys and superalloys, vacuum melted specialty alloys, and exotic alloy products driven by increased demand from the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, chemical process industry, and electrical energy markets. Our direct international sales increased $94.5 million, or 17%, to $660.8 million, and represented 32% of sales for the High Performance Metals segment. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): Titanium mill products 30,689 27,361 12 % Nickel based and specialty steel alloys 44,688 42,873 4 % Exotic alloys 5,169 4,304 20 % Average Prices (per lb.): Titanium mill products $ 30.14 $ 33.83 (11 %) Nickel based and specialty steel alloys $ 19.16 $ 14.35 34 % Exotic alloys $ 41.85 $ 40.39 4 % Aerospace represents a significant market for our High Performance Metals segment, especially for premium quality specialty metals used in the manufacture of jet engines for the original equipment and spare parts markets. In addition, we are becoming a larger supplier of specialty metals used in airframe construction. In January 2007, we announced a long term sourcing agreement with GE Aviation for the supply of premium titanium alloys, nickel based superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys products for commercial and military jet engine applications. Total revenues under this agreement plus Allvacs direct sales to GE Aviation for the period 2007 through 2011 may exceed $2 billion. In addition, in October 2006 we announced a long term agreement with The Boeing Company to supply titanium alloys products for Boeings aircraft airframes and structural components, including Boeings 787 Dreamliner. Total revenues under this contract are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion for the years 2007 through 2015. This long term agreement includes both long product forms which are manufactured within the High Performance Metals segment, and a significant amount of plate products which are manufactured utilizing assets of both the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled 24 Table of Contents Products segments. Revenues and profits associated with these mill products covered by the long term agreement are included primarily in the results for the High Performance Metals segment. The commercial aerospace markets use of titanium is expected to increase significantly as new aircraft airframe production is utilizing a larger percentage of titanium material. For example, the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner airframe (excluding engines), is expected to require approximately 250,000 pounds of titanium alloys mill products per aircraft, a significant increase over any previous commercial aircraft airframe. New aircraft designs from Airbus, the A380 and A350 XWB, and from defense contractors are also expected to utilize a greater percentage of titanium. Given the record backlogs of both Boeing and Airbus, and the engine manufacturers, this increasing demand for titanium alloys mill products is expected to last into the next decade. Annually, revenue passenger miles and freight miles have increased 8.8% and 7.4%, respectively, since 2003, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The ICAO expects this growth trend to continue at over 6% annually well into the next decade based on the demand for passenger and freight travel from developing economies, especially in Asia and the Middle East, and continuing economic growth in the rest of the world. Commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries of new aircraft have increased 5.4% annually since 2003. Independent forecasts from both Airline Monitor and Forecast International project continuing growth of commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries into the next decade. Due to manufacturing cycle times, demand for our specialty metals leads the deliveries of new aircraft by 12 to 18 months. In addition, as our specialty metals are used in jet engines, demand for our products for spare parts is impacted by aircraft flight activity and engine refurbishment requirements of U.S. and foreign aviation regulatory authorities.

Segment results in 2007 and 2006 were affected by volatile raw material costs. Nickel and nickel bearing scrap, and titanium scrap increased significantly in 2006 and the first half of 2007, but declined sharply in the 2007 second half. These material costs are largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material indices which attempt to match purchased material costs with shipments. However in an environment of rapidly increasing, or declining costs, these raw material indices included in product selling prices may not completely offset purchased material costs. The rapid fall in raw material costs in the 2007 second half had a significant negative effect on operating profit as shipments produced with raw material purchased earlier in the year at higher costs were sold based upon raw material indices which reflected lower raw material prices. This negative impact on operating profit was offset by a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $96.3 million. In 2006, higher nickel, nickel bearing scrap, and titanium raw material costs resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $49.4 million. 27 Table of Contents We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2007. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled approximately $42 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $26 million from procurement, $11 million from operating efficiencies, and $5 million from salaried and hourly labor cost savings. To support our strategic growth initiatives in the High Performance Metals segment, we have committed to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities. Under projects announced in the past three years, we expect to spend approximately $885 million, of which approximately $355 million has been spent as of December 31, 2007. These projects include a multi phase titanium products expansion that is expected to yield up to 46 million pounds of annual titanium sponge production capacity, an increase in ATIs annual titanium melt capacity by at least 25 million pounds, and expansion of our forging and finishing operations for titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys. These strategic capital investments are designed to expand and enhance ATIs capacity and capabilities to meet current and expected demand growth from the aerospace (both engine and airframe), defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, and medical markets. In the first quarter 2007, we entered into a new labor agreement, which expires on June 30, 2011, with the United Steelworkers represented at ATIs Allvac Albany, Oregon operations. As a result of this new agreement, we recognized a non recurring pre tax charge of $0.7 million. 2006 Compared to 2005 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment increased 45% to $1.81 billion in 2006 due primarily to increased volume and higher average selling prices for most of our products driven by strong demand from the aerospace and defense, medical, oil and gas, chemical process industry, and electrical energy markets. Our exotic alloys business continued to benefit from demand from the aerospace, defense, chemical processing, and medical markets. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): Titanium mill products 27,361 24,882 10 % Nickel based and specialty steel alloys 42,873 39,939 7 % Exotic alloys 4,304 4,018 7 % Average Prices (per lb.): Titanium mill products $ 33.83 $ 22.75 49 % Nickel based and specialty steel alloys $ 14.35 $ 11.25 28 % Exotic alloys $ 40.39 $ 40.38 % Segment operating profit for 2006 increased due to higher volume and pricing, and also improved due to product mix. Segment results in 2006 and 2005 was adversely affected by higher raw material costs, which increased significantly in the past several years. These higher costs, while largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material indices, had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our LIFO inventory accounting methodology, resulting in LIFO inventory valuation reserve charges of $49.4 million in 2006, and $46.0 million in 2005. We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2006. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, for 2006 totaled approximately $39 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $20 million from procurement, $15 million from operating efficiencies, and $3 million from salaried and hourly labor cost savings. Flat Rolled Products (In millions) 2007 % Change 2006 % Change 2005 Sales to external customers $ 2,951.9 9 % $ 2,697.3 42 % $ 1,900.5 Operating income 505.2 45 % 348.0 126 % 154.1 Operating income as a percentage of sales 17.1 % 12.9 % 8.1 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 23.1 % 18.1 % 18.7 % Our Flat Rolled Products segment produces, converts and distributes stainless steel, nickel based alloys, and titanium and titanium based alloys, in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip products, as well as grain oriented electrical steel sheet, and tool steels. The major end markets for our flat rolled products are electrical energy, oil and gas, chemical processing, automotive, food processing equipment and appliances, construction and mining, electronics, 28 Table of Contents communication equipment and computers, and aerospace and defense. The operations in this segment are ATI Allegheny Ludlum, our 60% interest in the Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), and our 50% interest in the industrial titanium joint venture known as Uniti LLC. The remaining 40% interest in STAL is owned by the Baosteel Group, a state authorized investment company whose equity securities are publicly traded in the Peoples Republic of China. The financial results of STAL are consolidated into the segments operating results with the 40% interest of our minority partner recognized in the consolidated statement of income as other income or expense. The remaining 50% interest in Uniti LLC is held by VSMPO, a Russian producer of titanium, aluminum, and specialty steel products. We account for the results of the Uniti joint venture using the equity method since we do not have a controlling interest. 2007 Compared to 2006 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2007 were $2.95 billion, or 9% higher than 2006, due primarily to higher average raw material surcharges and increased average base prices for most products, especially titanium and grain oriented electrical steel products, and improved product mix, partially offset by a significant reduction in shipments of standard stainless products. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): High value 491,891 502,524 (2 %) Standard 557,016 889,105 (37 %) Total Flat Rolled Products 1,048,907 1,391,629 (25 %) Average Prices (per lb.): High value $ 3.22 $ 2.50 29 % Standard $ 2.40 $ 1.61 49 % Total Flat Rolled Products $ 2.79 $ 1.93 44 % Total shipments in 2007 decreased by 25% to 1,049 million pounds compared to shipments of 1,392 million pounds for 2006. The average transaction prices to customers, which includes the effect of higher average raw material surcharges, increased by 44% to $2.79 per pound in 2007. Our direct international sales increased $192.2 million, or 39%, to $680.4 million, and represented 23% of sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment. While the majority of direct international sales were for high value products, sales of standard products, primarily stainless steel cold roll sheet, increased to $145 million dollars. Our Flat Rolled Products segment high value product shipments, which include engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, super stainless steel, nickel based alloys, titanium and titanium based alloys, grain oriented electrical steel, and tool steel products, decreased 2% while average transaction prices for our high value products increased 29%. Strong demand for our nickel based alloy, titanium, and grain oriented electrical steel products from the chemical process industry, oil and gas, and electrical energy markets was offset by lower demand for our engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, and super stainless steel products. Shipments of titanium and ATI produced Uniti titanium products grew nearly 25% to approximately 10.4 million pounds, and shipments of our grain oriented electrical steel grew 5%, both compared to 2006. Shipments of our standard products, which primarily include stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, and stainless steel plate, decreased 37% while average transaction prices for these products increased 50%. In 2007, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products decreased by more than 17%, compared to 2006 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). The decrease in shipments was primarily attributable to inventory adjustments by service center customers primarily for stainless steel sheet. Our The Switch is On marketing campaign had its best year ever in 2007 as customers in both the U.S. and Europe recognized the value of lean nickel products, such as AL201HP stainless, which has approximately one half the nickel content as the most common Type 304 stainless product with similar corrosion properties and greater strength. In 2007, shipments of AL201HP stainless increased over 57% compared to 2006. 29 Table of Contents Apparent Domestic Consumption Stainless Sheet and Strip (Millions of tons) * 2007 represents November YTD, annualized Apparent Domestic Consumption Stainless Sheet and Strip (Millions of tons) 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 Millions/Tons 1.88 1.55 1.58 1.57 1.81 1.62 1.84 1.53 Source: SSINA The majority of our flat rolled products are sold at prices that include surcharges for raw materials, including purchased scrap, that are required to manufacture our products. These raw materials include nickel, iron, chromium, and molybdenum. Nickel, which comprises a significant percentage of our material costs, continued to be volatile during 2007. The cost of nickel increased 51% during the first five months of 2007 to an average monthly cost of $23.63 per pound in May 2007. However, during the next seven months of 2007, the cost of nickel declined 50% to an average monthly cost of $11.79 per pound in December 2007. While the rapid run up in nickel costs increased our average transactional selling prices for 2007, we believe the volatility of these costs had a negative effect on our shipment volumes, as customers reduced the amount of material that was held in stock and altered their normal purchasing pattterns. 30 Table of Contents Iron Scrap Prices ($/Gross Ton) 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 144 83 129 85 74 105 173 233 255 229 297 Nickel Prices ($/lb) 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 2.70 1.76 3.67 3.32 2.69 3.26 6.43 6.25 6.09 15.68 11.79 Source: London Metals Exchange 31 Table of Contents Chromium Prices ($/lb) 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 0.49 0.40 0.39 0.41 0.29 0.35 0.54 0.69 0.54 0.66 1.71 Source: Platts Metals Week Molybdenum Oxide ($/lb) 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 3.69 2.57 2.56 2.23 2.36 3.26 7.26 31.24 26.58 24.78 32.38 Source: Platts Metals Week 32 Table of Contents Operating income increased $157.2 million, or 45%, to $505.2 million for 2007, compared to 2006. The benefits of higher average base selling prices, improved product mix and the benefits from our gross cost reduction initiatives, offset significantly lower shipments. During 2007, the average cost of our raw materials in our Flat Rolled Products segment increased approximately 6% compared to the 2006 average cost. These increased costs, largely offset by lower inventory quantities, resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation charge of $1.9 million for 2007 compared to a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $147.3 million in 2006. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our operations. In 2007, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $60 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $28 million from operating efficiencies, $24 million from procurement savings, and $8 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses. In the first quarter 2007, we entered into a new labor agreement with the United Steelworkers represented at ATIs Allegheny Ludlum operations. The new agreement expires on June 30, 2011. The new agreement provides for profit sharing above specified minimum pre tax profit for the Flat Rolled Products segment and is capped to provide for no more than $20 million of profit sharing payments under this provision over the four year life of the contract. Any profit sharing payments under this provision are contributed to an independently administered VEBA (Voluntary Employee Benefit Association) trust. As a result of this new agreement, we recognized a non recurring pre tax charge of $4.8 million. To support our strategic growth initiatives in the Flat Rolled Products segment, we committed to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities in certain areas. In January 2007, we announced the expansion of ATI Allegheny Ludlums titanium and specialty plate facility located in Washington, PA. The purpose of this capital investment is to meet growing demand for our products from the aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, and electrical energy markets. This investment benefits both our Flat Rolled Products and High Performance Metals segments. We expect this investment to be approximately $60 million with completion planned for the end of the second quarter 2008. The titanium and specialty plate capital project includes increasing reheat and annealing furnace, and flattening capacity at the existing plate mill. In addition, our plate size capabilities are being expanded and significant productivity improvements are expected to be realized. In 2006, we announced the expansion of our STAL joint venture operations in Shanghai, China. This expansion, which is expected to more than triple STALs precision rolling and slitting capacity, is estimated to cost approximately $110 million. The expansion is expected to be fully operational in the 2009 first quarter and is expected to be funded through capital contributions from the joint venture partners, including a $25 million capital contribution which has been made by ATI, bank credit lines of the joint venture, and cash on hand and the internal cash flow of the joint venture. 2006 Compared to 2005 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2006 were $2.70 billion, or 42% higher than 2005, due primarily to increased volume, higher average base selling prices and higher average raw material surcharges. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): High value 502,524 495,868 1 % Standard 889,105 652,870 36 % Total Flat Rolled Products 1,391,629 1,148,738 21 % Average Prices (per lb.): High value $ 2.50 $ 2.15 16 % Standard $ 1.61 $ 1.26 28 % Total Flat Rolled Products $ 1.93 $ 1.64 18 % Our Flat Rolled Products segment high value product shipments, which include engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, super stainless steel, nickel based alloys, titanium, grain oriented electrical steel, and tool steel products, increased 1%, with average transaction prices for our high value products increasing 16%, primarily due to product mix. Demand was strong for our specialty stainless, grain oriented electrical steel, titanium, and nickel based alloy products from the chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and aerospace and defense markets. Our direct international sales, which were primarily comprised of high value 33 Table of Contents products, increased $134.7 million, or 38%, to $485.6 million, and represented a record 18.0% of sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment. Shipments of standard products, which primarily include stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, and stainless steel plate, increased 36% and average transaction prices for these products increased 28%. In 2006, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products increased approximately 14%, compared to 2005 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). Demand was strong for our standard products from the biofuel (ethanol) and construction markets and was good from the appliance and appliance related markets. Operating income increased to $348.0 million for 2006 compared to $154.1 million in 2005. The benefits of increased sales volume, higher average base selling prices, cost reduction initiatives, and additional surcharges offset a significantly higher LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge due to higher raw material costs. During 2006, the average cost of our raw materials in our Flat Rolled Products segment increased approximately 49% compared to the 2005 average cost. As a result, for 2006 we recognized a charge of $147.3 million under the LIFO inventory costing methodology. In 2005, we recorded a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of approximately $8.9 million as a result of slightly lower raw material costs compared to 2004. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our operations. In 2006, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $96 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $75 million from operating efficiencies, $11 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses, and $10 million from procurement savings. At the end of 2005, we decided to indefinitely idle the West Leechburg, PA flat rolled products finishing facility, which occurred in stages during 2006. These restructuring charges of $17.5 million, plus charges of $8.5 million for fair market value adjustments of previously recognized asset impairments, are excluded from 2005 segment operating profit. Engineered Products (In millions) 2007 % Change 2006 % Change 2005 Sales to external customers $ 433.0 % $ 432.7 10 % $ 393.4 Operating profit 32.1 (43 %) 56.7 19 % 47.5 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 7.4 % 13.1 % 12.1 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 28.7 % 26.8 % 28.6 % Our Engineered Products segment includes the production of tungsten powder, tungsten heavy alloys, tungsten carbide materials and carbide cutting tools. The segment also produces carbon alloy steel impression die forgings, and large grey and ductile iron castings, and provides precision metals processing services. The operations in this segment are ATI Metalworking Products, ATI Portland Forge, ATI Casting Service and ATI Rome Metals. The major markets served by our products of the Engineered Products Segment include a wide variety of industrial markets including oil and gas, machine and cutting tools, transportation, construction and mining, electrical energy, aerospace and defense, and automotive. 2007 Compared to 2006 Sales for the Engineered Products segment in 2007 were $433.0 million, comparable to 2006 sales. Demand for our tungsten and tungsten carbide products improved from the aerospace and defense, and cutting tool markets, but was lower from the oil and gas market for down hole drilling applications. Demand was strong for our forged products from the construction and mining, and oil and gas markets and demand was soft from the transportation market. Demand for our cast products was strong from the electrical energy market for wind and natural gas power generation applications. Demand remained strong for our titanium precision metal processing conversion services, primarily due to the aerospace market. Segment operating profit in 2007 was $32.1 million, or 7.4% of sales, compared to $56.7 million, or 13.1% of sales for 2006. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to higher purchased raw material costs, start up costs associated with our newly expanded ammonium paratungstate (APT) plant, and the slower than planned ramp up of this plant. In 2007, we commenced commercial operations at the new APT plant, a $17 million capital investment that began in the 2005 fourth quarter. The new APT plant allows us to expand our production capacity to internally source all of our APT and cobalt requirements at what is expected to be 34 Table of Contents significantly lower costs than purchased material. Operating profit included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $2.3 million in 2007, and a charge of $0.3 million in 2006 as a result of higher raw material costs and inventory levels. During 2007, in addition to the APT plant expansion, we continued to invest in order to enhance our manufacturing capabilities and reduce costs. In 2007, we invested $6.5 million to expand our titanium precision metal conversion services operation as part of our continuing strategic program to increase our overall titanium production capacity to better meet growing global demand, primarily from the aerospace market. In addition, during the third quarter 2007, we acquired production assets in Alpena, MI to manufacture and machine large iron castings to support our growth in the wind energy market. The cost of acquiring these assets was $9.7 million. It is expected that these assets will be put into service over the first half of 2008. In 2007, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $9 million in our Engineered Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $5 million from operating efficiencies, $3 million from procurement savings, and $1 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses. 2006 Compared to 2005 Sales in 2006 for the Engineered Products segment increased 10%, to $432.7 million, and operating profit increased 19%, to $56.7 million, both compared to 2005. Demand for our tungsten products was strong from the oil and gas, construction and mining, aerospace and defense, and power generation markets. Demand was strong for our forged products from the transportation, construction and mining, and oil and gas markets. Demand for our cast products was strong from the wind energy, and transportation markets. Demand remained very strong for our titanium precision metal processing conversion services. The improvement in segment sales was primarily due to higher selling prices and increased volume, including shipments from our U.K. based ATI Garryson Limited cutting tool operations acquired in April 2005. Segment operating profit improved to $56.7 million in 2006, principally as a result of improved pricing and the benefits of cost reductions, which totaled $8.2 million. This improvement in operating profit was partially offset by the negative impact of higher raw material costs especially in the second half of the 2006 year. Operating profit included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $0.3 million in 2006 and a charge of $8.7 million in 2005 as a result of higher raw material costs and inventory levels. Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were 1.4% of sales, or $73.8 million, in 2007 compared to 1.4% of sales, or $68.9 million, in 2006 and 1.5% of sales, or $51.7 million, in 2005. The increase in corporate expenses in 2007 and 2006 was primarily the result of expenses associated with annual and long term performance based incentive compensation programs, partially offset by cost controls. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net of interest income and interest capitalization, was $4.8 million for 2007 compared to $23.3 million for 2006, and $38.6 million for 2005. Interest expense is presented net of interest income of $26.0 million for 2007, $15.0 million for 2006, and $8.4 million for 2005. The increase in interest income for 2007 and 2006 primarily results from higher cash balances. Increased capital expenditures associated with strategic investments to expand our production capabilities resulted in higher interest capitalization in 2007 and 2006. Interest expense in 2007, 2006, and 2005 was reduced by $9.8 million, $4.5 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, related to interest capitalization on capital projects. In prior years, we entered into receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts related to our $300 million, 8.375% 10 year Notes (Notes), which were later settled, resulting in a gain. The settlement gain is being amortized into income as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the 10 year Notes. Interest expense decreased by $1.8 million in 2007, $1.7 million in 2006, and $1.5 million in 2005 due to these previously settled interest rate swap agreements. Restructuring Costs We had no restructuring costs in 2007 or 2006. In 2005, we recorded a restructuring charge of $23.9 million primarily related to recognizing an asset impairment charge for certain long lived assets in the Flat Rolled Products segment. At the end of 2005, we decided to indefinitely idle Allegheny Ludlums West Leechburg, PA flat rolled products finishing facility. The cost of indefinitely idling the facility was $17.3 million. The 2005 35 Table of Contents restructuring charge also included adjustments of previously recognized asset impairment charges for changes in estimated fair market values. We recorded $8.5 million of asset impairment charges associated with previously idled assets in the Flat Rolled Products segment at the Washington Flat Roll coil facility located in Washington, PA, and at the stainless steel plate facility located in Massillon, OH, partially offset by a $1.9 million reversal of previously recorded lease termination charges. At December 31, 2007, approximately $2 million of prior year workforce reduction and facility closure charges are future cash requirements that will be paid over the next several years. Cash to meet these obligations is expected to be paid from internally generated funds from operations. Other Expenses, Net of Gains on Asset Sales Other expenses, net of gains on asset sales, includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations, pretax gains and losses on the sale of surplus real estate, non strategic investments and other assets, operating results from equity method investees, minority interest, and other non operating income or expense. These items are presented primarily in selling and administrative expenses, and in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of income and resulted in net charges of $10.2 million in 2007 and $15.2 million in 2006, and other income of $33.8 million in 2005. Other expenses for 2007 and 2006 primarily related to legal costs associated with closed operations. For 2005, other expenses included $26.8 million for legal matters, which were paid in 2006 and are classified in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income, and $7.0 million for environmental and other closed company costs. Retirement Benefit Expense Retirement benefit expense, which includes pension and postretirement medical benefits, has declined since 2004 primarily due to actual returns on plan assets exceeding expected returns, and the positive benefits of voluntary pension contributions totaling $350 million over past four years. Retirement benefit expense was $30.3 million for 2007, $81.9 million for 2006, and $77.6 million for 2005. Retirement benefit expenses are included in both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses. Retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses for the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Cost of sales $ 20.3 $ 55.3 $ 55.1 Selling and administrative expenses 10.0 26.6 22.5 Total retirement benefit expense $ 30.3 $ 81.9 $ 77.6 Total retirement benefit expense for 2008 is expected to be approximately $1.0 million, a decline of $29.3 million compared to 2007. This decrease is primarily attributable to the pension component of retirement benefit expense. As a result of higher than expected returns on pension assets in 2007 and the benefits of the $100 million voluntary contribution to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan made in the 2007 fourth quarter, we expect pension income for 2008 to be approximately $13.0 million compared to pension expense of $17.1 million for 2007. Postretirement medical expense, the other component of retirement benefit expense, is expected to increase to approximately $14.0 million in 2008, compared to $13.2 million in 2007, primarily as a result of lower plan assets in 2008 as benefit payments are expected to reduce VEBA trust assets. Income Taxes Results of operations for 2007 included a provision for income taxes of $400.2 million, or 34.9% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The results for 2007 benefited from a $23.1 million reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance with respect to certain state tax credits expected to be realized in future periods. Results of operations for 2006 included a provision for income taxes of $298.5 million, or 34.2% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The results for 2006 benefited from a favorable $8.7 million adjustment of prior years taxes. For 2005, results of operations included an income tax benefit of $53.3 million principally related to the reversal of the remaining valuation allowance for our U.S. Federal net deferred tax assets, partially offset by accruals for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. From the 2003 fourth quarter through the third quarter of 2005, we maintained a valuation allowance for a major portion of our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets and certain state deferred tax assets in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, due to uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax asset, including the 2003 and 2004 unutilized net operating losses. In the 2003 fourth quarter we had recorded a $138.5 million valuation allowance for the majority of our net deferred tax asset, based upon the results of our quarterly evaluation concerning the estimated probability that the net deferred tax asset would be realizable in light of our history of annual reported losses 36 Table of Contents in the years 2001 through 2003. In 2005, we generated taxable income which exceeded the 2003 and 2004 net operating losses allowing us to fully realize these U.S. Federal tax benefits. This realization of tax benefits, together with our improved profitability, required us to eliminate the remaining valuation allowance for U.S. Federal income taxes in the 2005 fourth quarter. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. At December 31, 2007, we had a net deferred tax asset of $60.9 million. A significant portion of our deferred tax assets relates to the postretirement benefit obligations, which have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements but which are not recognized for income tax reporting purposes until the benefits are paid. These benefit payments are expected to occur over an extended period of years. Financial Condition and Liquidity We believe that internally generated funds, current cash on hand, and available borrowings under existing credit lines will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs, including a substantial expansion of our production capabilities over the next few years. We did not borrow funds under our domestic senior unsecured credit facility, or former facility during 2007, 2006 or 2005, although a portion has been utilized to support letters of credit. Our ability to access the credit markets in the future to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be influenced by our credit rating. As of December 31, 2007, Moodys Investor Services senior unsecured debt rating for our Company was Baa3 with a stable ratings outlook. On February 11, 2008, Standard Poors Ratings Services raised our corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to BBB with a stable ratings outlook. Changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to, or the cost of, our existing credit facilities. We have no off balance sheet financing relationships with variable interest or structured finance entities. Cash Flow and Working Capital In 2007, cash generated by operations of $809.8 million and the proceeds from the exercises of stock options of $5.5 million were used to invest $457.1 million in capital expenditures and purchases of businesses, fund a $100 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, purchase $61.2 million of the Companys common stock, pay dividends of $58.1 million, repay debt of $23.9 million, and increase cash balances by $121.0 million to $623.3 million at December 31, 2007. In 2006, cash generated by operations of $411.6 million, the proceeds from exercises of stock options of $33.1 million, and tax benefits on share based compensation of $80.9 million were used to invest $238.3 million in capital expenditures, fund a $100 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, pay dividends of $43.1 million, repay debt of $7.1 million, and increase cash balances by $139.6 million to $502.3 million at December 31, 2006. In 2005, cash generated from operations of $323.8 million, the proceeds from exercises of stock options of $26.1 million, and tax benefits on share based compensation of $25.2 million were used to invest $91.3 million in capital expenditures, fund a $100 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, pay $18.3 million for the acquisition of the Garryson Limited operation, repay debt of $25.7 million, pay dividends of $27.1 million, and increase cash balances by $111.9 million to $362.7 million at December 31, 2005. We use cash flow from operations before voluntary pension plan contributions in order to evaluate and compare fiscal periods that do not include these contributions, and to make resource allocation decisions among operational requirements, investing and financing alternatives. 37 Table of Contents Managed Working Capital ($ Millions) 03 04 05 06 07 Millions/$ 576 853 1,048 1,582 1,627 % of Annualized Revenue 30.7 % 29.5 % 30.3 % 29.0 % 32.2 % In 2007 and 2006, the favorable impact of improved operating results on cash flow from operations was offset by continuing investment in managed working capital to support the higher business levels and the effect of higher costs for certain raw materials. As part of managing the liquidity of the business, we focus on controlling inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. In measuring performance in controlling this managed working capital, we exclude the effects of the LIFO inventory valuation reserves, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which, due to their nature, are managed separately. During 2007, managed working capital, which we define as gross inventory plus accounts receivable less accounts payable, increased $44.3 million. This increase resulted from a $41.1 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter 2007 compared to the fourth quarter 2006, and a $36.2 million increase in inventory, mostly as a result of increased operating volumes particularly for the High Performance Metals segment products, partially offset by a $33.0 million increase in accounts payable. During 2006, managed working capital increased by $534.2 million. This increase resulted from a $166.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales in the 2006 fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, and a $409.2 million increase in inventory, mostly as a result of increased operating volumes and higher raw materials costs, partially offset by a $41.5 million increase in accounts payable. Managed working capital has increased approximately $1.1 billion over the past five years as our level of business activity and raw material costs have both increased. This increase in managed working capital is expected to represent a future source of cash if the level of business activity were to decline. Managed working capital as a percent of annualized sales increased to 32.2% at the end of 2007, compared to 29.0% at the end of 2006, and 30.3% in 2005. The increase in 2007 of managed working capital as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a shift in mix to more value added products, primarily in the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products business segments, which have a longer manufacturing process. While accounts receivable balances increased during this three year period, days sales outstanding, which measures actual collection timing for accounts receivable, have improved. 38 Table of Contents The components of managed working capital were as follows: December 31, December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Accounts receivable, net $ 652.2 $ 610.9 $ 442.1 Inventory, net 916.1 798.7 607.1 Accounts payable (388.4 ) (355.1 ) (312.9 ) Subtotal 1,179.9 1,054.5 736.3 Allowance for doubtful accounts 6.3 5.7 8.1 LIFO reserve 374.6 466.7 269.7 Corporate and other 65.7 55.3 33.9 Managed working capital $ 1,626.5 $ 1,582.2 $ 1,048.0 Annualized prior 2 months sales $ 5,058.5 $ 5,453.5 $ 3,461.1 Managed working capital as a % of sales 32.2 % 29.0 % 30.3 % Capital expenditures for 2007 were $447.4 million, compared to $238.3 million in 2006, and $91.3 million in 2005. We are significantly expanding our manufacturing capabilities to meet current and expected demand growth from the aerospace (engine and airframe) and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical markets, especially for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, specialty alloys, and exotic alloys. These self funded capital investments remain on track to be completed as planned and include: The expansion of ATIs aerospace quality titanium sponge production capabilities, including our titanium sponge facility in Albany, OR, and our greenfield premium grade titanium sponge (jet engine rotating parts) facility in Rowley, UT. Twelve titanium sponge reduction furnaces at Albany, OR are now in operation, bringing our current annual titanium sponge capacity at this facility to approximately 16 million pounds. When the full expansion of the Albany facility is completed by mid 2008, we expect that this facility will be capable of producing 22 million pounds annually of aerospace quality titanium sponge and represent a total capital investment of approximately $100 million. The Rowley, UT sponge facility remains on schedule and will represent a total capital investment of approximately $460 million. We expect to begin producing premium grade titanium sponge at the Utah facility by the end of 2008, with 24 million pounds of annual capacity to be reached by the fourth quarter of 2009. Upon completion of these titanium sponge expansion projects, our annual sponge production capacity is projected to be 46 million pounds. In addition, the Utah facility will have the infrastructure in place to further expand annual capacity by approximately 18 million pounds, bringing the total annual capacity at that facility to 42 million pounds, if needed. We expect to supplement our requirements with titanium sponge and titanium scrap purchases from external sources. The expansion of ATIs melting capabilities for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and specialty alloys. For titanium melting, three new vacuum arc remelt (VAR) furnaces are on line, and we plan to have two more titanium VAR furnaces customer qualified by the end of the first quarter 2008. VAR melting is a consumable electrode re melting process that improves the cleanliness and chemical homogeneity of the alloys. Our third Plasma Arc Melt (PAM) premium titanium melt furnace is in production and has completed initial customer qualifications. We expect to have this PAM furnace qualified for all products, including premium grade jet engine rotating quality products, during the second quarter 2008. A fourth PAM furnace to support premium titanium alloy growth requirements is expected to begin production by the third quarter 2009. Plasma arc melting is a superior cold hearth melting process for making alloyed titanium products for jet engine rotating parts, medical applications, and other critical applications. We also expect one new vacuum arc remelt (VAR) furnace for nickel based alloys and superalloys to be qualified and in commercial production by the first quarter of 2008, with up to three more VARs to be added through 2009 based on production requirements to support titanium and titanium based alloys and premium nickel based alloys and superalloys growth. The expansion of ATIs mill products processing and finishing capabilities for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and specialty alloys. Announced projects include expanding titanium precision metal processing conversion capacity, which was completed in the third quarter 2007, and a $260 million expansion of our titanium and superalloy forging capacity at our Bakers, NC facility through the addition of an integrated 10,000 ton press forge, 700mm rotary forge, and conditioning, finishing and inspection facilities to support increased forged product requirements, which is expected to be operational by the third quarter 2009. Forging is a hot forming process that produces wrought forging billet and forged machining bar from an ingot. We also are investing $60 million to expand our titanium and specialty plate facility located in Washington, PA, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter 2008. In addition to titanium and titanium alloys, ATIs specialty plate products include duplex alloys, superaustenitic alloys, nickel based alloys, zirconium alloys, armor plate, 39 Table of Contents and common austenitic stainless grades. This project includes increasing reheat furnace, annealing, and flattening capacity at the existing plate mill, expanding plate size capabilities, and implementing productivity improvements. We are increasing our zirconium sponge production capacity by approximately 20%. In addition, we have diverted two new VAR furnaces to zirconium melting. These two VARs were originally planned for titanium melting. This new zirconium sponge and melting capacity better positions ATI for the strong nuclear electrical energy and chemical process industry markets. The above described strategic growth capital projects represent approximately $985 million of self funded capital investments, approximately $435 million of which had already been expended through 2007. We currently expect that our projected 2008 capital expenditures will be approximately $500 million, including expenditures for the completion of the above mentioned strategic capital projects as well as other potential growth capital projects. Additionally, STAL, our Chinese joint venture company in which ATI has a 60% interest, commenced an expansion of its operations in Shanghai, China in late 2006. This expansion, which is expected to more than triple STALs rolling and slitting capacity to produce Precision Rolled Strip products, is estimated to cost approximately $110 million. The expansion is expected to be fully operational in the 2009 first quarter and is expected to be funded through capital contributions from the joint venture partners, bank credit lines of the joint venture, and cash on hand and internal cash flow of the joint venture. Our cash contribution to this expansion was $24.8 million, of which one half was contributed by ATI in the 2006 third quarter, and the remainder in March 2007. The financial results of STAL are consolidated into our financial statements with the 40% interest of our minority partner recognized as other income or expense in the consolidated statements of income and as a liability in the consolidated statements of financial position. Debt Total debt outstanding decreased $25.4 million, to $528.2 million at December 31, 2007, from $553.6 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily related to reduced net borrowings at our foreign operations and scheduled debt maturity payments. In managing our overall capital structure, some of the measures on which we focus are net debt to total capitalization, which is the percentage of our debt, net of cash that may be available to reduce borrowings, to our total invested and borrowed capital, and total debt to total capitalization, which excludes cash balances. At December 31, 2007, our cash on hand exceeded our total debt. Therefore our net debt to total capitalization was a negative 4.5% compared to a positive 3.3% at December 31, 2006, 19.7% at December 31, 2005, and 43.5% at December 31, 2004. Total debt to total capitalization improved to 19.2% at December 31, 2007 compared to 26.9% at December 31, 2006, 41.0% at December 31, 2005, and 57.5% at December 31, 2004. The continuing improvement in these ratios during 2007 is due primarily from increases in cash on hand and stockholders equity resulting from the improvement in results of operations.

The unsecured facility includes a $200 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Under the unsecured facility, the Company may increase the size of the facility by up to $100 million without seeking the further approval of the lending group. The unsecured facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and 40 Table of Contents amortization) of not greater than 3.25, and maintain an interest coverage ratio (consolidated earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest expense) of not less than 2.0. For the year ended December 31, 2007, our leverage ratio was 0.46, and our interest coverage ratio was 37.36. We have not borrowed funds under the senior unsecured domestic facility, or former facility, during 2007, although a portion has been utilized to support the issuance of letters of credit. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the unsecured facility at December 31, 2007, were approximately $43 million, compared to $120 million at the end of 2006. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2007 was 20.8 and 25.0, respectively. In August 2007, STAL, our Chinese joint venture company in which ATI has a 60% interest, entered into a five year revolving credit facility with a group of banks. Under the credit facility, STAL may borrow up to 741 million renminbi (approximately $99 million at December 2007 exchange rates) at an interest rate equal to 90% of the applicable lending rate published by the Peoples Bank of China. The credit facility is supported solely by STALs financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners, and is intended to be utilized in the future for the expansion of STALs operations, which are located in Shanghai, China. The credit facility requires STAL to maintain a minimum level of shareholders equity, and certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2007, there had been no borrowings made under this credit facility. STAL had approximately $20.5 million in letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2007. These letters of credit are supported solely by STALs financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners. Interest rate swap contracts have been used from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. At December 31, 2007, we have no interest rate swap contracts in place. We have deferred gains on settled receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts associated with our $300 million, 8.375% Notes. These gains on settlement, which occurred in 2004 and 2003, remain a component of the reported balance of the Notes, and are ratably recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes, which is approximately four years. At December 31, 2007, the deferred settlement gain was $8.7 million. The result of the receive fixed, pay floating arrangements was a decrease in interest expense of $1.8 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, compared to the fixed interest expense of the ten year Notes.

(C) We have various contractual obligations that extend through 2015 for services involving production facilities and administrative operations. Our purchase obligation as disclosed represents the estimated termination fees payable if we were to exit these contracts. 41 Table of Contents (D) Drawn amounts were $17.7 million at December 31, 2007 under foreign credit agreements, and drawn amounts are included in total debt. Drawn amounts also include $43.1 million utilized under the $400 million domestic senior unsecured credit facility for standby letters of credit, which renew annually and are used to support: $27.8 million in workers compensation and general insurance arrangements, and $15.3 million related to environmental, legal and other matters. Retirement Benefits The value of the investments in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan exceeded pension plan liabilities as of November 30, 2007, our measurement date for accounting purposes, by $230 million, or approximately 11%. We have not been required to make cash contributions to this defined benefit pension plan since 1995. However, during the past four years, we have made $350 million in voluntary cash contributions to this plan to improve the plans funded position. These voluntary contributions were comprised of cash contributions of $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $50 million during the third quarter 2004. Based on current regulations and actuarial studies, we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for at least the next several years. However, we may elect, depending upon investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. We fund certain retiree health care benefits for Allegheny Ludlum using investments held in a Company administered Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) trust. This allows us to recover a portion of the retiree medical costs. In accordance with our labor agreements, during 2007, 2006, and 2005, we funded $30.8 million, $28.1 million, and $24.7 million, respectively, of retiree medical costs using the investments of the VEBA trust. We may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the investments held in the VEBA. The value of the investments held in the VEBA was approximately $76 million as of November 30, 2007, our measurement date for accounting purposes. Dividends We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock for each of the first three quarters of 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our common stock by nearly 40% to $0.18 per share. This was the third consecutive year that ATI has significantly increased its dividend. The payment of dividends and the amount of such dividends depends upon matters deemed relevant by our Board of Directors, such as our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by law, credit agreements or senior securities, and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate. Share Repurchase Program On November 1, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of $500 million. Repurchases of Company common stock are expected to be made on the open market or in unsolicited or privately negotiated transactions. Share repurchases are expected to be funded from internal cash flow and cash on hand. The number of shares to be purchased, and the timing of the purchases, will be based on several factors, including the level of cash balances, general business conditions, and other investment opportunities. As of December 31, 2007, 674,800 shares of common stock had been purchased under this program at a cost of $61.2 million. Critical Accounting Policies The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality. 42 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when title passes or as services are rendered. We have no significant unusual sale arrangements with any of our customers. We market our products to a diverse customer base, principally throughout the United States. Trade credit is extended based upon evaluations of each customers ability to perform its obligations, which are updated periodically. Accounts receivable reserves are based upon an aging of accounts and a review for collectibility of specific accounts. Accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $6.3 million at December 31, 2007 and $5.7 million at December 31, 2006, which represented 1.0% and 0.9%, respectively, of total gross accounts receivable. During 2007, we recognized expense of $1.0 million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off $0.4 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve. During 2006, we wrote off $1.7 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve, and also reduced expense by $0.7 million from decreasing the reserve for doubtful accounts. Inventories At December 31, 2007, we had net inventory of $916.1 million. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last in, first out (LIFO), first in, first out (FIFO) and average cost methods) or market, less progress payments. Costs include direct material, direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs. Most of our inventory is valued utilizing the LIFO costing methodology. Inventory of our non U.S. operations is valued using average cost or FIFO methods. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have been extremely volatile during the past three years. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results, while, conversely, a fall in material costs results in a benefit to operating results. For example, in 2007, the effect of falling raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which was $92.1 million lower than have been recognized had we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. However, in 2006 and 2005, the effect of increases in raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $197.0 million, and $45.8 million higher, respectively, than would have been recognized if we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. In a period of rising prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Conversely, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. The LIFO inventory valuation methodology is not utilized by many of the companies with which we compete, including foreign competitors. As such, our results of operations may not be comparable to those of our competitors during periods of volatile material costs due, in part, to the differences between the LIFO inventory valuation method and other acceptable inventory valuation methods. We evaluate product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value. The calculation of a resulting reserve, if any, is recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified. At December 31, 2007, no such reserves were required. It is our general policy to write down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months. In some instances this criterion is up to twenty four months due to the longer manufacturing and distribution process for such products. Asset Impairment We monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets. An impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an assets use (including any proceeds from disposition) are less than the assets carrying value, and the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Changes in the expected use of a long lived asset group, and the financial performance of the long lived asset group and its operating segment, are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment. Future cash flow value may include appraisals for property, plant and equipment, land and improvements, future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets, and other operating considerations. Retirement Benefits We have defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all of our employees. We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (FAS 87), as amended by FAS 158 regarding the balance sheet presentation of pension assets and liabilities. FAS 87 requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to 43 Table of Contents the plan. A significant element in determining our pension (expense) income in accordance with FAS 87 is the expected investment return on plan assets. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration input from our third party pension plan asset managers and actuaries regarding the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. Our expected return on pension plan investments has been 8.75% for each of past five years. We apply this assumed rate to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension (expense) income for the current year. The actual return on pension plan assets was 10.9% for 2007, 18.2% for 2006, 9.7% for 2005, 11.7% for 2004, and 13.1% for 2003. While the actual return on pension plan investments has exceeded the expected return on pension plan investments for each of the past five years, our expected return on pension plan investments for 2008 remains at 8.75%. The effect of increasing, or lowering, the expected return on pension plan investments by 0.25% results in additional annual income, or expense, of approximately $6.0 million. The cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods. The amount of expected return on plan assets can vary significantly from year to year since the calculation is dependent on the market value of plan assets as of the end of the preceding year. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to calculate the expected return on pension assets using either an average of fair market values of pension assets over a period not to exceed five years, which reduces the volatility in reported pension income or expense, or their fair market value at the end of the previous year. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission currently does not permit companies to change from the fair market value at the end of the previous year methodology, which is the methodology that we use, to an averaging of fair market values of plan assets methodology. As a result, our results of operations and those of other companies, including companies with which we compete, may not be comparable due to these different methodologies in calculating the expected return on pension investments. At the end of November, we determined the discount rate to be used to value pension plan liabilities. In accordance with FAS 87, the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. In estimating this rate, we receive input from our actuaries regarding the rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments with maturities matched to the expected future retirement benefit payments. Based on this assessment at the end of November 2007, we established a discount rate of 6.25% for valuing the pension liabilities as of the end of 2007, and for determining the pension expense for 2008. We had previously assumed a discount rate of 5.8% for 2006, which determined the 2007 expense, 5.9% for 2005, which determined the 2006 expense, 6.1% for 2004, which determined the 2005 expense, and 6.5% for 2003, which determined the 2004 expense. The effect of increasing the discount rate to 6.25%, from 5.8% in the previous year, decreased pension liabilities by approximately $103 million at 2007 year end, and is expected to decrease pension expense by approximately $8.1 million in 2008. The effect on pension liabilities for changes to the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, are deferred and amortized over future periods in accordance with FAS 87. We adopted FAS 158 as of year end 2006. FAS 158 requires that the net funded position of the plans, as measured by the projected benefit obligation (PBO) in the case of pension plans, and by the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) in the case of other postretirement benefit plans, be recognized as an asset or liability in the employers balance sheet. Prior period information was not restated. In addition, the new standard requires assets and benefits to be measured at the date of our statement of financial position, which is December 31, rather than our measurement date of November 30, as currently permitted. This change in our measurement date is effective for our year ending December 31, 2008. Prior to the adoption of FAS 158, the funded status of pension plans was measured by the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO). At the November 30, 2006 measurement date, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was overfunded on an ABO basis, and we reversed the previously recorded minimum pension liability and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with this plan when it had been in an ABO underfunded position, recorded a prepaid pension cost asset of $569.9 million, and increased stockholders equity by $389.8 million, net of related deferred tax effects. However, on a PBO basis, which is the funded status measure required by FAS 158, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by $5.6 million at the measurement date. For our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, the adoption of FAS 158 eliminated the $569.9 million prepaid pension cost, established a $5.6 million noncurrent liability, and reduced stockholders equity by $345.3 million, net of related deferred tax effects. We also sponsor other non qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K., and several postretirement benefit plans. Including these other pension and postretirement benefit plans, the aggregate effect of adopting FAS 158 reduced stockholders equity by $342.6 million, net of related deferred tax effects, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The net effect of these adjustments was an increase in stockholders equity of $47.2 million at year end 2006. These charges and adjustments did not affect our results of operations and did not have a cash impact. We also sponsor several postretirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees and retirees. These plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Under most of the plans, our contributions towards premiums are 44 Table of Contents capped based upon the cost as of certain dates, thereby creating a defined contribution. For the non collectively bargained plans, we maintain the right to amend or terminate the plans in the future. We account for these benefits in accordance with FAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAS 106), as amended by FAS 158, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as benefits are paid. We use actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for the plans. The discount rate, which is determined annually at the end of each year, is developed based upon rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. At the end of 2007, we determined this rate to be 6.25%, compared to a 5.8% discount rate in 2007, 5.9% discount rate in 2005, 6.1% discount rate in 2004 and 6.5% in 2003. The effect of increasing the discount rate to 6.25% from 5.8% reduced year end 2007 postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $18.0 million and is expected to decrease 2008 expense by approximately $0.6 million. Based upon predictions of continued significant medical cost inflation in future years, the annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits for health care plans is 10.8% for 2008 and is assumed to gradually decrease to 5.0% in the year 2019 and remain level thereafter. Certain of these postretirement benefits are funded using plan investments held in a Company administered VEBA trust. The expected return on plan investments is a significant element in determining postretirement benefits expenses in accordance with FAS 106. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. For 2007, our expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 9%. This assumed long term rate of return on investments is applied to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan investments that is included in annual postretirement benefits expenses for the current year. While the actual return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 16.9% in 2007, 50.0% in 2006, 11.6% in both 2005 and 2004, and 9.3% for 2003, our expected return on investments in the VEBA trust remains 9% for 2008. The expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust is expected to exceed the return on pension plan investments due to a higher percentage of private equity investments held by the VEBA trust. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In the 2007 first quarter, as required, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) titled Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities (FSP PMMA). This FSP amends an AICPA Industry Audit guide and is applicable to all industries that accrue for planned major maintenance activities. The FSP PMMA prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities, which was the policy we previously used to record planned plant outage costs on an interim basis within a fiscal year, and also to record the costs of major equipment rebuilds which extend the life of capital equipment. The FSP PMMA was effective as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Under the FSP PMMA, we report results using the deferral method whereby major equipment rebuilds are capitalized as costs are incurred and amortized to expense over the estimated useful lives, and planned plant outage costs are fully recognized in the interim period of the outage. The adoption of the FSP PMMA on January 1, 2007, resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $10.3 million, net of related taxes. As required by the FSP PMMA, our financial statements have been restated to reflect this FSP as if this standard had been applied to the earliest period presented. As a result, our net income for 2006, 2005 and 2004 increased $2.2 million, $2.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, or approximately $0.02 per share for each year. In the 2007 first quarter, we also adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes recognition and measurement standards for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is the determination of whether a tax position should be recognized in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is to be recognized only if we determine that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based upon the technical merits of the position. In step two, for those tax positions which should be recognized, the measurement of a tax position is determined as being the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 was effective for the beginning of ATIs 2007 fiscal year, with adoption treated as a cumulative effect type reduction to retained earnings of $5.6 million as of the beginning of 2007. As a result of implementing FIN 48, we recognized a $19.4 million increase in the long term liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and a $13.8 million increase in deferred tax assets for tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. The net result of these recognized assets and liabilities was 45 Table of Contents a reduction to beginning retained earnings of $5.6 million. Including liabilities recognized in the FIN 48 adoption, our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 were $26.3 million. Interest and penalties recognized at the FIN 48 adoption were $3.5 million. It is our policy to classify interest and penalties recognized on underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Companys income tax provision included $11.8 million of expense related to uncertain tax positions, which increased the long term liability to $38.1 million. We expect that settlements for nearly all of the contractual cash obligations for liabilities for uncertain tax positions will occur more than five years in the future. Including tax positions for which we determined that the tax position would not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold upon examination by the tax authorities based upon the technical merits of the position, the total estimated unrecognized tax benefit that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate was approximately $20 million. At this time, we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately $2 million of the estimated unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 will be recognized within the next twelve months. In September 2006, the FASB Statement No. 158 (FAS 158), was issued amending the standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting. The new standard requires that the net funded position of the plans, as measured by the difference between plan assets and the projected benefit obligation in the case of pension plans, and by the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation in the case of other postretirement benefit plans, be recognized as an asset or liability in the employers balance sheet. As required under the accounting rules which existed prior to adoption of the new standard, we recognized an increase to stockholders equity of $389.8 million at year end 2006 primarily as a result of the improved funded position of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. Simultaneously, the adoption of FAS 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of $342.6 million, which was recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The net effect of both of these adjustments was an increase in stockholders equity of $47.2 million. In addition, the new standard will require assets and benefits to be measured at the date of the employers statement of financial position, which is December 31 in our case, rather than our measurement date of November 30, as currently permitted. This change will be effective for our 2008 year. In the fourth quarter 2005, we adopted the FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (FAS 143). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FAS 143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. An entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated, even if conditional on a future event. For existing asset retirement obligations which are determined to be recognizable under FIN 47, the effect of applying FIN 47 is recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Our adoption of FIN 47 resulted in recognizing a charge of $2.0 million, net of income taxes, or $0.02 per share, in the fourth quarter 2005 principally for estimable asset retirement obligations related to remediation costs which would be incurred if we were to cease certain manufacturing activities which utilize what may be categorized as potentially hazardous materials. Pending Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The Standard covers financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements. FAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities, and for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FAS 157 will have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (FAS 159), The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities. FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. If the fair value option is elected, unrealized gains and losses will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS 159 but do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (FAS 160), Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. FAS 160 changes the classification of noncontrolling (minority) interests on the balance sheet and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling 46 Table of Contents interests. Under the new standard, noncontrolling interests are considered equity and are to be reported as an element of stockholders equity rather than within the mezzanine or liability sections of the balance sheet. In addition, the current practice of reporting minority interest expense or benefit also will change. Under the new standard, net income will encompass the total income before minority interest expense. The income statement will include separate disclosure of the attribution of income between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership interest amount are to accounted for as equity transactions. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and earlier application is prohibited. Upon adoption, the balance sheet and the income statement will be recast retrospectively for the presentation of noncontrolling interests. The other accounting provisions of the statement are required to be adopted prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS 160, including the reporting of the minority interest in our STAL joint venture, will have on our financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, other long term liabilities included $55.7 million for minority interest in our STAL joint venture. Forward Looking Statements From time to time, the Company has made and may continue to make forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements in this report relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, would, should, will, will likely result, forecast, outlook, projects, and similar expressions. Such forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which the Company is unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results or performance to materially differ from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such statements. Various of these factors are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and will be described from time to time in the Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Companys Annual Reports on Form 10 K and the Companys subsequent reports filed with the SEC on Form 10 Q and Form 8 K, which are available on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov and on the Companys website at http://www.alleghenytechnologies.com. We assume no duty to update our forward looking statements. 47 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. We attempt to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible. At December 31, 2007, we had approximately $59 million of floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.7%. Approximately $41 million of this floating rate debt is capped at a 6% maximum interest rate. Since the interest rate on floating rate debt changes with the short term market rate of interest, we are exposed to the risk that these interest rates may increase, raising our interest expense in situations where the interest rate is not capped. For example, a hypothetical 1% in rate of interest on the $18 million of our outstanding floating rate debt not subjected to a cap would result in increased annual financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. Volatility of Energy Prices. Energy resources markets are subject to conditions that create uncertainty in the prices and availability of energy resources. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, have and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We use approximately 10 to 12 million MMBtus of natural gas annually, depending upon business conditions, in the manufacture of our products. These purchases of natural gas expose us to risk of higher gas prices. For example, a hypothetical $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of approximately $10 to $12 million. We use several approaches to minimize any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations from volatile energy prices. These approaches include incorporating an energy surcharge on many of our products and using financial derivatives to reduce exposure to energy price volatility. Volatility of Raw Material Prices. We use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of increased raw material costs; however, competitive factors in the marketplace can limit our ability to institute such mechanisms, and there can be a delay between the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefit of such mechanisms. For example, in 2007 we used approximately 80 million pounds of nickel; therefore a hypothetical change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately $80 million. In addition, in 2007 we also used approximately 500 million pounds of ferrous scrap in the production of our flat rolled products and a hypothetical change of $0.01 per pound would result in increased costs of approximately $5 million. While we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations, such as for nickel, we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure. We believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts, but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials. 48 Table of Contents
