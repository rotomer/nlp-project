Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements. Actual results or performance could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described below. Overview of 2008 Financial Performance While 2008 presented a challenging business environment, we enhanced our position in key global growth markets, launched new production facilities, and maintained our strong balance sheet while achieving sales and earnings per share representing the second best year in the history of the Company. Net income for the full year 2008 was $565.9 million, or $5.67 per share, compared to $747.1 million, or $7.26 per share, for 2007. For 2008, return on capital employed was 21.8%, and return on stockholders equity was 27.0%. Sales were $5.31 billion compared to $5.45 billion for 2007. Direct international sales increased 2% to $1.49 billion, and represented 28% of our total sales. Our 2008 results reflect ATIs transformation into a globally focused, diversified high value specialty metals company with strong cash flow and liquidity, and a solid balance sheet. The aerospace and defense and global infrastructure markets, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical have been driving our performance for the last several years. For 2008, 29% of our sales were to the aerospace and defense market, 23% to the chemical process industry and oil and gas markets, 16% to the electrical energy market, and 3% to the medical market. These major high value global markets represented 71% of ATIs 2008 sales. In our High Performance Metals segment, year over year sales decreased 6% to $1.94 billion, due primarily to decreased demand from the aerospace and defense market, primarily as a result of delays in new aircraft build schedules and the weakening global economy, and softening demand in the oil and gas market, as a result of the rapid decline in crude oil and natural gas prices in the second half of 2008 due to the weakening global economy. The declines in these markets were partially offset by increased demand for our exotic materials, especially from the chemical process industry and nuclear energy markets. Operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment was $539.0 million, a 26% decrease compared to 2007, due primarily to lower shipments and average selling prices for our nickel based alloys and specialty alloys, and lower average selling prices for our titanium alloys, which were partially offset by increased shipments of our titanium and exotic alloys, and benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts. In our Flat Rolled Products segment, sales decreased 1% to $2.91 billion primarily as a result of lower average base selling prices and raw material surcharges for most of our products, which was partially offset by increased product shipments. While total product shipments increased 3% for the full year 2008, demand for many of our products declined significantly in the second half of the year, and especially in the fourth quarter, as a result of the worsening effects of the financial credit crisis and the weakening global economy. Demand for our specialty and titanium sheet, and grain oriented electrical steel products improved during the first nine months of 2008 from the global electrical energy, oil and gas, and chemical process industry markets, but softened in the fourth quarter. Shipments of standard stainless products increased 5% for the full year but declined significantly in the second half of 2008 as demand from service center and other customers weakened considerably. Operating profit for the Flat Rolled Products segment was $377.4 million, a 25% decrease compared to 2007. The decline in 2008 operating profit was due primarily to lower average base selling prices for most of our products, which was partially offset by increased shipments and the benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts. In our Engineered Products segment, 2008 sales increased 5% to $455.7 million primarily due to improved demand from the cutting tool, transportation, electrical energy, and construction and mining markets. However, operating profit declined to $20.9 million, compared to $32.1 million in 2007, primarily due to an abrupt decrease in demand in the 2008 fourth quarter as a result of the worsening financial credit crisis and the weakening global economy, lower selling prices, and start up costs associated with our Alpena, MI casting operation. 22 Table of Contents For 2008, total segment operating profit decreased 26% to $937.3 million, a decrease of $329.1 million compared to 2007. Total segment operating profit as a percentage of total sales was 17.7% in 2008, compared to 23.2% in 2007. During 2008, we enhanced our positions in key global growth markets, continued to enhance our manufacturing capabilities, reduced costs, and maintained our strong balance sheet. We also realized continued success in implementing the ATI Business System, which is continuing to drive lean manufacturing throughout our operations. Our accomplishments during 2008 from these important efforts included: We continued to grow our global market presence as direct international sales reached a record $1.49 billion, or 28% of total sales. We believe that nearly 50% of ATIs 2008 sales were driven by global markets when we consider exports of our customers. We continued to transform the Company moving from a products focus to a market focus through the formation of market sector teams which are empowered to assist our customers in dealing with Mission Critical Metallics, manufacturing, and certainty of supply challenges they face. These teams, ATI Aerospace, ATI Defense, ATI Oil Gas, and ATI Nuclear Energy, integrate our Companys broad capabilities to deliver product breadth and technical depth to address customers current and future needs. We continued to realize significant benefits from our strategic focus on high value specialty products, especially titanium, and on long term customer relationships. In 2008, shipments of titanium products, including ATI produced products for our Uniti titanium joint venture, increased 15% to over 47 million pounds. Over the past three years, our shipments of all titanium products have increased 47%. These volume increases are being achieved utilizing our manufacturing capabilities across both our High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products segments and demonstrate our ability to supply the marketplace with both long and flat rolled products. We continued to build a foundation for further profitable growth. We significantly increased self funded strategic capital investments in our businesses to support the expected long term growth in our markets, especially for titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys. During the past four years, we have invested over $1.3 billion, of which $515.7 million was spent in 2008, to expand our titanium sponge production, and our melting, rolling and finishing capabilities. Our recently completed and on going major strategic capital projects include: The expansion of ATIs aerospace quality titanium sponge production capabilities, including our titanium sponge facility in Albany, OR, and our greenfield premium grade titanium sponge facility in Rowley, UT for a total capital investment of approximately $600 million. Titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products. The last phase of the titanium sponge production expansion at our Albany, OR facility was completed at the end of the 2008 first quarter. Initial production at the Rowley, UT premium grade sponge facility is expected to commence in the 2009 third quarter. When both the Oregon and Utah facilities are operational, our total annual titanium sponge production capacity is expected to be approximately 46 million pounds, and is intended to reduce our purchased titanium sponge and purchased titanium scrap requirements. The capacity of the Utah facility could be increased by an additional 18 million pounds with a further capital investment if market conditions warrant such an investment. The design and construction of a titanium alloys and nickel based alloys and superalloys forging facility at our operations in North Carolina at an estimated cost of approximately $260 million. This new facility, which is being constructed in phases through 2009, will include a new 10,000 ton press forge and a new 700mm rotary forge, both of which will be the largest of their kind in the world for producing these types of alloys. It will also include billet conditioning and finishing equipment. The conditioning, finishing and inspection assets commenced operations in the 2008 third quarter and the forging equipment is expected to be operational by the third quarter 2009. A $60 million upgrade and expansion of our titanium and specialty plate facility in Washington, PA. In addition to titanium and titanium alloys, our specialty plate products include duplex alloys, superaustenitic, nickel based alloys, zirconium alloys, armor plate, and specialty and standard stainless grades. This upgrade and expansion was completed in the second quarter of 2008. The design and construction of a new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility at our Brackenridge, PA site. In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved a strategic investment in ATIs Flat Rolled Products segment. The project is expected to cost approximately $1.16 billion and is expected to be completed in 2012. It is designed to produce exceptional quality, thinner, and wider hot rolled coils at reduced cost with shorter lead times, and require lower working capital requirements. The return on investment should be more than 20% by 2014, including estimated annual cost reductions 23 Table of Contents of $120 million. When completed, we believe ATIs new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility will provide unsurpassed manufacturing capability and versatility in the production of a wide range of flat rolled specialty metals. In connection with the new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility, we announced the consolidation of our Natrona, PA grain oriented electrical steel melt shop into ATIs Brackenridge, PA melt shop. This consolidation is expected to improve the overall productivity of ATIs flat rolled grain oriented electrical steel and other stainless and specialty alloys, and reduce the cost of producing slabs and ingots. The investment should also result in significant reduction of particulate emissions. This consolidation is expected to be completed in 2010. Our Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), in which ATI has a 60% interest, commenced an expansion of its Precision Rolled Strip operations in Shanghai, China. This expansion is expected to more than triple STALs precision rolling and slitting capacity when operational in the first quarter of 2009. As a result of these strategic investments, we currently plan to spend approximately $450 million for capital expenditures, excluding the capital expansion underway at our STAL joint venture, in 2009. We are committed to continuing to self fund these projects and can further adjust the timing of any project if necessary. We realized strong cash generation in 2008 with cash flow from operations of $755 million. Cash on hand at the end of 2008 was $470 million after investing $516 million in capital expenditures, repurchasing 6.2 million shares of the Companys common stock at a cost of $278 million, paying dividends of $71 million, making a $30 million voluntary cash contribution to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan, and reducing debt by $18 million. We continued to maintain our strong balance sheet. At the end of 2008, our net debt to total capitalization was 2.0% compared to (4.5%), 3.3%, 19.7% and 43.5% at year end 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total debt to total capital was 20.6% compared to 19.2%, 26.9%, 41.0%, and 57.5% at year end 2007, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. We continued to realize significant progress in safety across ATIs operations. As a result of our continuing focus on and commitment to safety, in 2008 our OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate improved by 17% to 2.51 and our Lost Time Case Rate improved by 35% to 0.34, which we believe to be competitive with world class performance. We realized continued success from the ATI Business System, which is continuing to drive lean manufacturing throughout our operations. In addition to the improved safety performance discussed above, we realized $134 million in gross cost reductions in 2008 which exceeded our goal of $100 million. We have targeted additional gross cost reductions of at least $150 million in 2009. While we believe ATI is well positioned for long term profitable growth, we expect 2009 to be challenging as a result of the effects of the current credit crisis in the financial markets and the global recession on many of our end markets. In addition, as a result of the historic negative returns in equity and fixed income markets in 2008, we expect annual 2009 pretax retirement benefit expense, which includes pension and other postretirement benefits, of approximately $140 million. This represents an increase of nearly $132 million compared to 2008. We have taken actions to adjust our production schedules, preserve cash and maintain our liquidity, and implement new cost reductions in response to the challenging and uncertain economic conditions. We continue to believe that the aerospace and defense and global infrastructure markets, namely chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical, have strong growth potential over the intermediate and long term. We intend to use these difficult market conditions to continue to positively differentiate ATI as a uniquely positioned, diversified, technology driven global specialty metals producer. Results of Operations Sales were $5.31 billion in 2008, $5.45 billion in 2007 and $4.94 billion in 2006. Direct international sales represented approximately 28% of 2008 sales, 27% of 2007 sales and 24% of 2006 sales. Segment operating profit was $937.3 million in 2008, $1.27 billion in 2007, and $1.06 billion in 2006. Our measure of segment operating profit, which we use to analyze the performance and results of our business segments, excludes income taxes, corporate expenses, net interest expense, retirement benefit expense, other costs net of gains on asset sales and restructuring costs, if any. We believe segment operating profit, as defined, provides an appropriate measure of controllable operating results at the business segment level. Income before tax was $860.1 million in 2008, $1.15 billion in 2007, and $872.6 million in 2006. 24 Table of Contents Net income was $565.9 million for 2008, $747.1 million for 2007, and $574.1 million for 2006. We operate in three business segments: High Performance Metals, Flat Rolled Products and Engineered Products. These segments represented the following percentages of our total revenues and segment operating profit for the years indicated: 2008 2007 2006 Operating Operating Operating Revenue Profit Revenue Profit Revenue Profit High Performance Metals 37 % 58 % 38 % 58 % 37 % 62 % Flat Rolled Products 55 % 40 % 54 % 40 % 54 % 33 % Engineered Products 8 % 2 % 8 % 2 % 9 % 5 % Information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. High Performance Metals (In millions) 2008 % Change 2007 % Change 2006 Sales to external customers $ 1,944.9 (6 %) $ 2,067.6 14 % $ 1,806.6 Operating profit 539.0 (26 %) 729.1 11 % 657.2 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 27.7 % 35.3 % 36.4 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 30.0 % 32.0 % 31.3 % Our High Performance Metals segment produces, converts and distributes a wide range of high performance alloys, including titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel and cobalt based alloys and superalloys, exotic alloys such as zirconium, hafnium, niobium, nickel titanium, and their related alloys, and other specialty metals, primarily in long product forms such as ingot, billet, bar, rod, wire, shapes and rectangles, seamless tube and castings. These products are designed for the high performance requirements of such major end markets as aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy and medical. The operating units in this segment are ATI Allvac, ATI Allvac Ltd (U.K.) and ATI Wah Chang. 2008 Compared to 2007 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment for 2008 decreased 6% to $1.94 billion, due primarily to decreased demand from the aerospace and defense market, primarily as a result of delays in aircraft build schedules and the weakening global economy, and the softening demand in the oil and gas market as a result of the rapid decline in crude oil and natural gas prices in the second half of 2008 due to the weakening global economy. The declines in these markets were partially offset by increased demand for our exotic materials, especially from the chemical process industry and nuclear energy markets. While our direct international sales of exotic material increased 8%, overall direct international sales decreased $77.8 million, or 12%, to $583.0 million, and represented 30% of sales for the High Performance Metals segment. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): Titanium mill products 32,530 30,689 6 % Nickel based and specialty steel alloys 42,525 44,688 (5 %) Exotic alloys 5,473 5,169 6 % Average Prices (per lb.): Titanium mill products $ 25.60 $ 30.14 (15 %) Nickel based and specialty steel alloys $ 18.14 $ 19.16 (5 %) Exotic alloys $ 48.53 $ 41.85 16 % Aerospace represents a significant market for our High Performance Metals segment, especially for premium quality specialty metals used in the manufacture of jet engines for the original equipment and spare parts markets. In addition, we have become a larger supplier of specialty metals used in airframe construction. Since 2005 we have increased our sales to the airframe segment of the market by over 110%, to $481 million in 2008. In January 2007, we announced a long term sourcing agreement with GE Aviation for the supply of premium titanium alloys, nickel based superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys products for commercial and military jet engine applications. Total revenues under this agreement plus Allvacs direct sales to GE Aviation for the period 2007 25 Table of Contents through 2011 may exceed $2 billion. In addition, in October 2006 we announced a long term agreement with The Boeing Company to supply titanium alloys products for Boeings aircraft airframes and structural components, including Boeings 787 Dreamliner. Total revenues under this contract may be as much as $2.5 billion for the years 2007 through 2015. This long term agreement includes both long product forms which are manufactured within the High Performance Metals segment, and a significant amount of plate products which are manufactured utilizing assets of both the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products segments. Revenues and profits associated with these titanium mill products covered by the long term agreement are included primarily in the results for the High Performance Metals segment. The commercial aerospace markets use of titanium alloys is expected to increase significantly as new aircraft airframe designs use a larger percentage of titanium alloys. For example, the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner airframe (excluding engines) is expected to require the purchase of approximately 250,000 pounds of titanium alloy mill products per aircraft, a significant increase over any previous commercial aircraft airframe. New aircraft designs from Airbus, the A380 and A350 XWB, and from defense contractors are also expected to utilize a greater percentage of titanium alloys. Given the significant current backlogs of both Boeing and Airbus, as well as the engine manufacturers, this increasing demand for titanium alloys mill products is expected to last into the next decade. However, The Boeing Company has experienced production difficulties with the construction of the new Boeing 787. These production difficulties, together with a labor work stoppage at The Boeing Company in September and October of 2008, resulted in excess availability of materials in the aerospace supply chain which has had an adverse effect in 2008 on the demand and selling prices for certain of the materials we produce, especially titanium alloys and nickel based superalloys. Annually, airline revenue passenger miles and freight miles have increased 5.5% and 7.0%, respectively, since 2004, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data. Based on December 2008 forecasts, the ICAO expects minimal growth in 2009, and then expects this growth trend to resume at between 4 5% annually well into the next decade based on the demand for passenger and freight travel from developing economies, especially in Asia and the Middle East, and expected continuing economic growth in the rest of the world. New commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries have increased 2.7% annually since 2004. Independent forecasts from both Airline Monitor and Forecast International project continuing growth of commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries into the next decade, following a period of near term declines in aircraft deliveries. Because of the current economic downturn, the actual rate and timing of future aircraft deliveries is uncertain. Due to manufacturing cycle times, demand for our specialty metals leads the deliveries of new aircraft by 12 to 18 months. In addition, as our specialty metals are used in rotating components of jet engines, demand for our products for spare parts is impacted by aircraft flight activity and engine refurbishment requirements of U.S. and foreign aviation regulatory authorities.

In addition, operating profit in 2008 and 2007 was affected by volatile raw material costs. Nickel and nickel bearing scrap, and titanium and titanium scrap prices decreased significantly in 2008 and the second of half of 2007 after increasing significantly during the first half of 2007. These material costs are largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material indices which attempt to match purchased material costs with shipments. However in an environment of rapidly declining, or increasing costs, these raw material indices included in product selling prices may not completely match related raw material costs. The fall in raw material costs in 2008 and in the second half of 2007 had a significant negative effect on operating profit as shipments produced with raw material purchased earlier in the year at higher costs were sold based upon raw material indices which reflected lower raw material prices. These negative impacts on operating profit were offset by LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefits of $70.6 million in 2008 and $96.3 million in 2007. 27 Table of Contents We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2008. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled approximately $65 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $55 million from operating efficiencies and procurement savings, and $10 million from reductions in compensation and benefit expenses. 2007 Compared to 2006 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment increased 14% to $2.07 billion in 2007 due primarily to improved volume and higher average selling prices for our nickel based alloys and superalloys, vacuum melted specialty alloys, and exotic alloy products driven by increased demand from the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, chemical process industry, and electrical energy markets. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): Titanium mill products 30,689 27,361 12 % Nickel based and specialty steel alloys 44,688 42,873 4 % Exotic alloys 5,169 4,304 20 % Average Prices (per lb.): Titanium mill products $ 30.14 $ 33.83 (11 %) Nickel based and specialty steel alloys $ 19.16 $ 14.35 34 % Exotic alloys $ 41.85 $ 40.39 4 % Segment operating profit for 2007 increased 11% to $729.1 million compared to 2006 primarily due to higher volume, higher average selling prices for many of our products, and improved product mix. Segment results in 2007 and 2006 were affected by volatile raw material costs. Nickel and nickel bearing scrap, and titanium scrap increased significantly in 2006 and the first half of 2007, but declined sharply in the 2007 second half. These material costs are largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material indices which attempt to match purchased material costs with shipments. However in an environment of rapidly increasing, or declining costs, these raw material indices included in product selling prices may not completely offset purchased material costs. The rapid fall in raw material costs in the 2007 second half had a significant, negative effect on operating profit as shipments produced with raw material purchased earlier in the year at higher costs were sold based upon raw material indices which reflected lower raw material prices. This negative impact on operating profit was offset by a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $96.3 million. In 2006, higher nickel, nickel bearing scrap, and titanium raw material costs resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $49.4 million. We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2007. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled approximately $42 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $26 million from procurement, $11 million from operating efficiencies, and $5 million from salaried and hourly labor cost savings. In the first quarter 2007, we entered into a new labor agreement, which expires on June 30, 2011, with the United Steelworkers represented at ATIs Allvac Albany, Oregon operations. As a result of this new agreement, we recognized a non recurring pre tax charge of $0.7 million. Flat Rolled Products (In millions) 2008 % Change 2007 % Change 2006 Sales to external customers $ 2,909.1 (1 %) $ 2,951.9 9 % $ 2,697.3 Operating income 377.4 (25 %) 505.2 45 % 348.0 Operating income as a percentage of sales 13.0 % 17.1 % 12.9 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 26.8 % 23.1 % 18.1 % Our Flat Rolled Products segment produces, converts and distributes stainless steel, nickel based alloys, specialty alloys, and titanium and titanium based alloys, in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip products, as well as grain oriented electrical steel sheet. The major end markets for our flat rolled products are electrical energy, oil and gas, chemical processing, automotive, food processing equipment and appliances, construction and mining, electronics, communication equipment and computers, and aerospace and defense. The operations in this segment are ATI Allegheny Ludlum, our 28 Table of Contents 60% interest in the Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), and our 50% interest in the industrial titanium joint venture known as Uniti LLC. The remaining 40% interest in STAL is owned by the Baosteel Group, a state authorized investment company whose equity securities are publicly traded in the Peoples Republic of China. The financial results of STAL are consolidated into the segments operating results with the 40% interest of our minority partner recognized in the consolidated statement of income as other income or expense. The remaining 50% interest in Uniti LLC is held by VSMPO, a Russian producer of titanium, aluminum, and specialty steel products. We account for the results of the Uniti joint venture using the equity method since we do not have a controlling interest. 2008 Compared to 2007 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2008 were $2.91 billion, or 1% lower than 2007, due primarily to lower average base selling prices and raw material surcharges for most products, which were partially offset by increased product shipments. While total product shipments increased 3% for the full year 2008, demand for many of our products declined significantly in the second half of 2008, and especially in the fourth quarter, as a result of the worsening effects of the financial credit crisis and the weakening global economy. Demand for our high value products, such as specialty alloys and titanium sheet, and grain oriented electrical steel, improved during the first nine months of 2008 from the global electrical energy, oil and gas, and chemical process industry markets but softened in the fourth quarter. Shipments of standard stainless products increased 5% for the full year but declined significantly in the second half of 2008 as demand from service center and other customers weakened considerably. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): High value 500,375 491,891 2 % Standard 584,389 557,016 5 % Total Flat Rolled Products 1,084,764 1,048,907 3 % Average Prices (per lb.): High value $ 3.26 $ 3.22 1 % Standard $ 2.13 $ 2.40 (11 %) Total Flat Rolled Products $ 2.65 $ 2.79 (5 %) Total shipments in 2008 increased by 3% to 1,085 million pounds compared to shipments of 1,049 million pounds in 2007. The average transaction prices to customers, which include the effect of lower average raw material surcharges, decreased by 5% to $2.65 per pound in 2008. Our direct international sales increased $100.3 million, or 15%, to a record $780.7 million, and represented 27% of sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment. While the majority of direct international sales were for high value products, sales of standard products, primarily stainless steel cold roll sheet, increased to $184 million, which represents an increase of approximately 124% since 2006. Our Flat Rolled Products segment high value product shipments, which include engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, super stainless steel, nickel based alloys, specialty alloys, titanium, and grain oriented electrical steel products, increased 2% while average transaction prices for these high value products increased 1%. Strong demand for our titanium products from the chemical process industry, and oil and gas markets, and for our grain oriented electrical steel products from the electrical energy distribution market was offset by lower demand for our engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, nickel based alloys, and super stainless steel products. Shipments of titanium and ATI produced Uniti titanium products grew 41% to approximately 14.7 million pounds, and shipments of our grain oriented electrical steel products grew 9%, both compared to 2007. Shipments of our standard products, which primarily include stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, and stainless steel plate, increased 5% while average transaction prices for these products decreased by 11%. In 2008, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products decreased by more than 14%, compared to 2007 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). The decrease in shipments was primarily attributable to weakening demand from consumer and industrial markets due to the U.S. recession and inventory adjustments by service center customers primarily for stainless steel sheet. 29 Table of Contents Apparent Domestic Consumption Stainless Sheet and Strip (Millions of tons) * 2008 represents November YTD, annualized Apparent Domestic Consumption Stainless Sheet and Strip (Millions of tons) 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 Millions/Tons 1.82 1.90 1.88 1.55 1.58 1.57 1.81 1.62 1.84 1.52 1.30 Source: SSINA The majority of our flat rolled products are sold at prices that include surcharges for raw materials, including purchased scrap, that are required to manufacture our products. These raw materials include nickel, iron, chromium, and molybdenum. Nickel, which comprises a significant percentage of our material costs, continued to be volatile during 2008. The cost of nickel increased 20% during the first three months of 2008 to an average monthly cost of $14.16 per pound in March 2008. However, during the next nine months of 2008, the cost of nickel declined 69% to an average monthly cost of $4.39 per pound in December 2008. The 2008 fourth quarter was an exceptional period of volatility for our other major raw materials: iron, chromium, and molybdenum which declined in value during the quarter by approximately 60%, 52%, and 71%, respectively.

The decline in 2008 operating profit was due primarily to lower average base selling prices for most of our products, which was partially offset by increased shipments and the benefits from our gross cost reduction initiatives. In addition, operating profit in 2008 and 2007 was affected by volatile raw material costs. Nickel and nickel bearing scrap, iron scrap, chromium, and molybdenum prices decreased significantly in 2008, especially in the fourth quarter. These material costs are largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material surcharges which attempt to match purchased material costs with shipments. However in an environment of rapidly declining, or increasing costs, these raw material indices included in product selling prices may not completely match our raw material costs due to the long manufacturing cycle times for some of our products. The rapid fall in raw material costs in 2008 had a significant, negative effect on operating profit as shipments produced with raw material purchased earlier in the year at higher costs were sold based upon raw material surcharges which reflected lower raw material costs. This negative impact on operating profit was offset by a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $89.8 million in 2008. During 2007, the average cost of our raw materials in our Flat Rolled Products segment increased approximately 6% compared to the 2006 average cost. These increased costs, largely offset by lower inventory quantities, resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation charge of $1.9 million for 2007. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our flat rolled products operations. In 2008, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $59 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $52 million from procurement savings and operating efficiencies and $7 million from reductions in compensation and benefit expenses. 2007 Compared to 2006 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2007 were $2.95 billion, or 9% higher than 2006, due primarily to higher average raw material surcharges and increased average base prices for most products, especially titanium and grain oriented electrical steel products, and improved product mix, partially offset by a significant reduction in shipments of standard stainless products. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was: 32 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Volume (000s lbs.): High value 491,891 502,524 (2 %) Standard 557,016 889,105 (37 %) Total Flat Rolled Products 1,048,907 1,391,629 (25 %) Average Prices (per lb.): High value $ 3.22 $ 2.50 29 % Standard $ 2.40 $ 1.61 49 % Total Flat Rolled Products $ 2.79 $ 1.93 44 % Total shipments in 2007 decreased by 25% to 1,049 million pounds compared to shipments of 1,392 million pounds for 2006. The average transaction prices to customers, which includes the effect of higher average raw material surcharges, increased by 44% to $2.79 per pound in 2007. Our direct international sales increased $192.2 million, or 39%, to $680.4 million, and represented 23% of sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment. While the majority of direct international sales were for high value products, sales of standard products, primarily stainless steel cold roll sheet, increased to $145 million. Our Flat Rolled Products segment high value product shipments, which include engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, super stainless steel, nickel based alloys, titanium and titanium based alloys, grain oriented electrical steel, and tool steel products, decreased 2% while average transaction prices for our high value products increased 29%. Strong demand for our nickel based alloy, titanium, and grain oriented electrical steel products from the chemical process industry, oil and gas, and electrical energy markets was offset by lower demand for our engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, and super stainless steel products. Shipments of titanium and ATI produced Uniti titanium products grew nearly 25% to approximately 10.4 million pounds, and shipments of our grain oriented electrical steel grew 5%, both compared to 2006. Shipments of our standard products, which primarily include stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, and stainless steel plate, decreased 37% while average transaction prices for these products increased 50%. In 2007, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products decreased by more than 17%, compared to 2006 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). The decrease in shipments was primarily attributable to inventory adjustments by service center customers primarily for stainless steel sheet. Our The Switch is On marketing campaign had its best year ever in 2007 as customers in both the U.S. and Europe recognized the value of lean nickel products, such as ATI201HP stainless, which has approximately one half the nickel content as the most common Type 304 stainless product with similar corrosion properties and greater strength. In 2007, shipments of ATI201HP stainless increased over 57% compared to 2006. The majority of our flat rolled products are sold at prices that include surcharges for raw materials, including purchased scrap, that are required to manufacture our products. These raw materials include nickel, iron, chromium, and molybdenum. Nickel, which comprises a significant percentage of our material costs, continued to be volatile during 2007. The cost of nickel increased 51% during the first five months of 2007 to an average monthly cost of $23.63 per pound in May 2007. However, during the next seven months of 2007, the cost of nickel declined 50% to an average monthly cost of $11.79 per pound in December 2007. While the rapid run up in nickel costs increased our average transactional selling prices for 2007, we believe the volatility of these costs had a negative effect on our shipment volumes, as customers reduced the amount of material that was held in stock and altered their normal purchasing patterns. Operating income increased $157.2 million, or 45%, to $505.2 million for 2007, compared to 2006. The benefits of higher average base selling prices, improved product mix and the benefits from our gross cost reduction initiatives, offset significantly lower shipments. During 2007, the average cost of our raw materials in our Flat Rolled Products segment increased approximately 6% compared to the 2006 average cost. These increased costs, largely offset by lower inventory quantities, resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation charge of $1.9 million for 2007 compared to a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $147.3 million in 2006. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our operations. In 2007, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $60 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $28 million from operating efficiencies, $24 million from procurement savings, and $8 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses. In the first quarter 2007, we entered into a new labor agreement with the United Steelworkers represented at ATIs Allegheny Ludlum operations. The new agreement expires on June 30, 2011. The new agreement provides for profit sharing above specified minimum pre tax profit for the Flat Rolled Products segment and is capped to provide for no more than $20 million of profit sharing 33 Table of Contents payments under this provision over the four year life of the contract. Any profit sharing payments under this provision are contributed to an independently administered VEBA (Voluntary Employee Benefit Association) trust. As a result of this new agreement, we recognized a non recurring pre tax charge of $4.8 million. Engineered Products (In millions) 2008 % Change 2007 % Change 2006 Sales to external customers $ 455.7 5 % $ 433.0 % $ 432.7 Operating profit 20.9 (35 %) 32.1 (43 %) 56.7 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 4.6 % 7.4 % 13.1 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 28.5 % 28.7 % 26.8 % Our Engineered Products segment includes the production of tungsten powder, tungsten heavy alloys, tungsten carbide materials and carbide cutting tools. The segment also produces carbon alloy steel impression die forgings, and large grey and ductile iron castings, and provides precision metals processing services. The operations in this segment are ATI Metalworking Products, ATI Portland Forge, ATI Casting Service and ATI Rome Metals. The major markets served by our products of the Engineered Products segment include a wide variety of industrial markets including oil and gas, machine and cutting tools, transportation, construction and mining, electrical energy, aerospace and defense, and automotive. 2008 Compared to 2007 Sales for the Engineered Products segment increased $22.7 million to $455.7 million in 2008. Demand for our tungsten and tungsten carbide products improved from the cutting tool, construction and mining, and electrical energy markets, but was lower from the oil and gas market for down hole drilling applications. Demand increased for our forged products from the transportation market. Demand for our cast products improved from the electrical energy market for wind and natural gas power generation applications. Demand remained steady for our titanium precision metal processing conversion services, primarily due to the aerospace market. While total sales increased 5% for full year 2008, demand for many of our products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the worsening effects of the financial credit crisis and the weakening global economy. Segment operating profit in 2008 declined to $20.9 million, or 4.6% of sales, compared to $32.1 million, or 7.4% of sales for 2007. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment for our tungsten and tungsten carbide products, higher raw material costs and $4.7 million of start up expenses associated with our Alpena, MI casting operation. This decline was partially offset by increased shipment volumes and the benefits of gross cost reductions. In addition, a rapid decline during the 2008 fourth quarter in raw material costs, primarily tungsten scrap, cobalt, and forging steel, resulted in higher cost material purchased earlier in the year flowing through cost of sales and not matching raw material surcharges included in selling prices due to manufacturing cycle time. This compression in profit margins was partially offset by a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $8.6 million. In 2007, operating profit included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $2.3 million as a result of higher raw material costs and inventory levels. In 2008, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $10 million in our Engineered Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $7 million from operating efficiencies and procurement savings and $3 million from lower compensation and benefit expenses. 2007 Compared to 2006 Sales for the Engineered Products segment in 2007 were $433.0 million, comparable to 2006 sales. Demand for our tungsten and tungsten carbide products improved from the aerospace and defense, and cutting tool markets, but was lower from the oil and gas market for down hole drilling applications. Demand was strong for our forged products from the construction and mining, and oil and gas markets and demand was soft from the transportation market. Demand for our cast products was strong from the electrical energy market for wind and natural gas power generation applications. Demand remained strong for our titanium precision metal processing conversion services, primarily due to the aerospace market. 34 Table of Contents Segment operating profit in 2007 was $32.1 million, or 7.4% of sales, compared to $56.7 million, or 13.1% of sales for 2006. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to higher purchased raw material costs, start up costs associated with our newly expanded ammonium paratungstate (APT) plant, and the slower than planned ramp up of this plant. In 2007, we commenced commercial operations at the new APT plant, a $17 million capital investment that began in the 2005 fourth quarter. The new APT plant allows us to expand our production capacity to internally source all of our APT and cobalt requirements at what is expected to be significantly lower costs than purchased material. Operating profit included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $2.3 million in 2007, and a charge of $0.3 million in 2006 as a result of higher raw material costs and inventory levels. In 2007, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $9 million in our Engineered Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $5 million from operating efficiencies, $3 million from procurement savings, and $1 million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses. Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were 1.1% of sales, or $56.8 million, in 2008 compared to 1.4% of sales, or $73.8 million, in 2007 and 1.4% of sales, or $68.9 million, in 2006. The higher level of corporate expenses in 2007 and 2006 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of higher expenses associated with annual and long term performance based incentive compensation programs. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net of interest income and interest capitalization, was $3.5 million for 2008 compared to $4.8 million for 2007 and $23.3 million for 2006. Interest expense is presented net of interest income of $9.8 million for 2008, $26.0 million for 2007, and $15.0 million for 2006. The decrease in interest income for 2008 was primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash. The increase in interest income for 2007 primarily resulted from higher cash balances. Increased capital expenditures associated with strategic investments to expand our production capabilities resulted in higher interest capitalization in 2008 and 2007. Interest expense in 2008, 2007, and 2006 was reduced by $25.0 million, $9.8 million, and $4.5 million, respectively, related to interest capitalization on capital projects. In prior years, we entered into receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts related to our $300 million, 8.375% 10 year Notes (Notes), which were later settled, resulting in a gain. The settlement gain is being amortized into income as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the 10 year Notes. Interest expense decreased by $2.0 million in 2008, $1.8 million in 2007, and $1.7 million in 2006 due to these previously settled interest rate swap agreements. Other Expenses, Net of Gains on Asset Sales Other expenses, net of gains on asset sales, includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations, pretax gains and losses on the sale of surplus real estate, non strategic investments and other assets, operating results from equity method investees, minority interest, and other non operating income or expense. These items are presented primarily in selling and administrative expenses, and in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of income and resulted in net charges of $8.5 million in 2008, $10.2 million in 2007 and $15.2 million in 2006. Other expenses for 2008, 2007 and 2006 primarily related to legal costs associated with closed operations. Retirement Benefit Expense Retirement benefit expense, which includes pension and postretirement medical benefits, had declined since 2004 primarily due to actual returns on plan assets exceeding expected returns, and the positive benefits of voluntary pension contributions totaling $415.2 million over the past five years. Retirement benefit expense was $8.4 million for 2008, $30.3 million for 2007, and $81.9 million for 2006. Retirement benefit expenses are included in both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses. Retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cost of sales $ 5.3 $ 20.3 $ 55.3 Selling and administrative expenses 3.1 10.0 26.6 Total retirement benefit expense $ 8.4 $ 30.3 $ 81.9 35 Table of Contents Primarily as a result of the historic negative returns in equity and fixed income markets in 2008, total retirement benefit expense for 2009 is expected to be approximately $140 million, an increase of $132 million compared to 2008. This increase is primarily attributable to the pension component of retirement benefit expense. As a result of lower than expected returns on pension assets in 2008, we expect pension expense for 2009 to be approximately $120 million compared to pension income of $12.2 million for 2008. Postretirement medical expense, the other component of retirement benefit expense, is expected to increase to approximately $20 million in 2009, compared to $20.6 million in 2008, primarily as a result of lower plan assets in 2009 as benefit payments are expected to reduce VEBA trust assets, offsetting lower expenses of defined contribution plans. Income Taxes Results of operations for 2008 included a provision for income taxes of $294.2 million, or 34.2% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The results for 2008 benefited from a $11.9 million favorable adjustment of prior years taxes. Results of operations for 2007 included a provision for income taxes of $400.2 million, or 34.9% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The results for 2007 benefited from a $23.1 million reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance with respect to certain state tax credits expected to be realized in future periods. Results of operations for 2006 included a provision for income taxes of $298.5 million, or 34.2% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The results for 2006 benefited from a favorable $8.7 million adjustment of prior years taxes. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. At December 31, 2008, we had a net deferred tax asset of $203.4 million. A significant portion of our deferred tax assets relates to retirement benefit obligations, which have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements but which are not recognized for income tax reporting purposes until the benefits are paid. These benefit payments are expected to occur over an extended period of years. Financial Condition and Liquidity We believe that internally generated funds, current cash on hand, and available borrowings under existing credit lines will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs, including the previously announced substantial expansion of our production capabilities over the next few years. We did not borrow funds under our domestic senior unsecured credit facility, or former facility, during 2008, 2007 or 2006, although a portion has been utilized to support letters of credit. Our ability to access the credit markets in the future to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be influenced by our credit rating. As of December 31, 2008, Moodys Investor Services senior unsecured debt rating for our Company was Baa3 with a stable ratings outlook. As of December 31, 2008, Standard Poors Ratings Services corporate credit and senior unsecured debt rating for our Company was BBB with a stable ratings outlook. Changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to, or the cost of, our existing credit facilities. We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S K. Cash Flow and Working Capital In 2008, cash generated by operations of $784.5 million was used to invest $515.7 million in capital expenditures, repurchase $278.3 million of the Companys common stock, pay dividends of $71.4 million, and fund a $30 million voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, decreasing our cash balance $153.4 million, to $469.9 million at December 31, 2008. In 2007, cash generated by operations of $809.8 million and the proceeds from the exercises of stock options of $5.5 million were used to invest $457.1 million in capital expenditures and purchases of businesses, fund a $100 million voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, purchase $61.2 million of the Companys common stock, pay dividends of $58.1 million, repay debt of $23.9 million, and increase cash balances by $121.0 million to $623.3 million at December 31, 2007. In 2006, cash generated by operations of $411.6 million, the proceeds from exercises of stock options of $33.1 million, and tax benefits on share based compensation of $80.9 million were used to invest $238.3 million in capital expenditures, fund a $100 million voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, pay dividends of $43.1 million, repay debt of $7.1 million, and increase cash balances by $139.6 million to $502.3 million at December 31, 2006. We use cash flow from operations before voluntary pension plan contributions in order to evaluate and compare fiscal periods that do not include these contributions, and to make resource allocation decisions among operational requirements, investing and financing alternatives. 36 Table of Contents As part of managing the liquidity of the business, we focus on controlling inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. In measuring performance in controlling this managed working capital, we exclude the effects of the LIFO inventory valuation reserves, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which, due to their nature, are managed separately. We also measure managed working capital as a percentage of the prior two months annualized sales to evaluate our performance based on recent levels of business volume. Managed Working Capital ($ Millions) 03 04 05 06 07 08 Millions/$ 576 853 1,048 1,582 1,627 1,412 % of Annualized Revenue 30.7% 29.5% 30.3% 29.0% 32.2% 35.2% In 2008, managed working capital, which we define as gross inventory plus gross accounts receivable less accounts payable, decreased by $214.8 million due to declining business levels, primarily in the fourth quarter 2008, and lower raw material costs. The decline in managed working capital was a source of cash in 2008, as gross inventory declined $203.5 million and accounts receivable declined $124.9 million, which was partially offset by an accounts payable decrease of $82.0 million. In 2007 and 2006, the favorable impact of improved operating results on cash flow from operations was offset by continuing investment in managed working capital to support the higher business levels and the effect of higher costs for certain raw materials. During 2007, managed working capital increased by $44.3 million. This increase resulted from a $41.1 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter 2007 compared to the fourth quarter 2006, and a $36.2 million increase in inventory, mostly as a result of increased operating volumes particularly for the High Performance Metals segment products, partially offset by a $33.0 million increase in accounts payable. During 2006, managed working capital increased by $534.2 million. This increase resulted from a $166.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales in the 2006 fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, and a $409.2 million increase in inventory, mostly as a result of increased operating volumes and higher raw materials costs, partially offset by a $41.5 million increase in accounts payable. Managed working capital has increased approximately $0.8 billion over the past five years as our level of business activity and raw material costs have both increased. Increases in managed working capital are expected to represent a future source of cash as the level of business activity declines. Managed working capital as a percent of annualized sales increased to 35.2% at the end of 2008, compared to 32.2% at the end of 2007, and 29.0% at the end of 2006. The rapid decline in demand as measured by annualized November and December 2008 sales increased our managed working capital on a percentage of sales basis. Additionally, the increase in 2008 of managed working capital as a percentage of sales was due to a continuing shift in mix to more value added products, primarily in the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products business segments, which have a longer manufacturing process. Days sales outstanding, which measures actual collection timing for accounts receivable, remained relatively constant in 2008 compared to 2007. 37 Table of Contents The components of managed working capital were as follows: December 31, December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Accounts receivable, net $ 530.5 $ 652.2 $ 610.9 Inventory, net 887.6 916.1 798.7 Accounts payable (278.5 ) (388.4 ) (355.1 ) Subtotal 1,139.6 1,179.9 1,054.5 Allowance for doubtful accounts 6.3 6.3 5.7 LIFO reserve 205.6 374.6 466.7 Corporate and other 60.2 65.7 55.3 Managed working capital $ 1,411.7 $ 1,626.5 $ 1,582.2 Annualized prior 2 months sales $ 4,008.0 $ 5,058.5 $ 5,453.5 Managed working capital as a % of sales 35.2 % 32.2 % 29.0 % Capital expenditures for 2008 were $515.7 million, compared to $447.4 million in 2007, and $238.3 million in 2006. We are significantly expanding our manufacturing capabilities to meet current and expected demand growth from the aerospace (engine and airframe) and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical markets, especially for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, specialty alloys, and exotic alloys. These self funded capital investments remain on track to be completed as planned and include: The expansion of ATIs aerospace quality titanium sponge production capabilities, including our titanium sponge facility in Albany, OR, and our greenfield premium grade titanium sponge (jet engine rotating parts) facility in Rowley, UT for a total capital investment of approximately $600 million. Titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products. The Albany, OR facility expansion was completed at the end of the 2008 first quarter. Initial production at the Rowley, UT premium grade sponge is expected to commence in the 2009 third quarter. When both the Oregon and Utah sponge facilities are fully operational, our total annual sponge production capacity is projected to be approximately 46 million pounds, and these secure supply sources are intended to reduce our purchased titanium sponge and purchased titanium scrap requirements. In addition, the Utah facility will have the infrastructure in place to further expand annual capacity by approximately 18 million pounds, bringing the total annual capacity at that facility to 42 million pounds, if needed. The expansion of ATIs melting capabilities for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and specialty alloys. For titanium melting, four new vacuum arc remelt (VAR) furnaces are on line, and we expect one more titanium VAR furnace to be customer qualified by the end of the first quarter 2009. VAR melting is a consumable electrode re melting process that improves the cleanliness and chemical homogeneity of the alloys. Our third Plasma Arc Melt (PAM) premium titanium melt furnace is in production and has completed conditional customer qualifications. This PAM furnace is now qualified for most of our products, including certain premium grade jet engine rotating quality products, and we expect the remaining qualifications to be completed in the second quarter 2009. Plasma arc melting is a superior cold hearth melting process for making alloyed titanium products for jet engine rotating parts, medical applications, and other critical applications. One new VAR furnace for nickel based alloys and superalloys was qualified and began commercial production in the first quarter of 2008. The expansion of ATIs mill products processing and finishing capabilities for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and specialty alloys. Announced projects include a $260 million expansion of our titanium and superalloy forging capacity at our Bakers, NC facility through the addition of an integrated 10,000 ton press forge, 700mm rotary forge, and conditioning, finishing and inspection facilities to produce large diameter products needed for certain demanding applications. The conditioning, finishing and inspection facilities began operations in the third quarter 2008, and the forging operations are expected to be operational by the third quarter 2009. Forging is a hot forming process that produces wrought forging billet and forged machining bar from an ingot. In June 2008, we commissioned the $60 million expansion of our titanium and specialty plate facility located in Washington, PA. In addition to titanium and titanium alloys, ATIs specialty plate products include duplex alloys, superaustenitic alloys, nickel based alloys, zirconium alloys, armor plate, and specialty and standard stainless grades. The Washington, PA expansion included increasing reheat furnace, annealing, and flattening capacity at the existing plate mill, expanding plate size capabilities, and implementing productivity improvements. A new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility at our existing Brackenridge, PA site. Our Board of Directors approved a strategic investment in ATIs Flat Rolled Products segment. The project is estimated to cost approximately $1.16 billion and is expected to be completed in 2012. It is designed to produce exceptional quality, thinner, and wider hot rolled coils at 38 Table of Contents reduced cost with shorter lead times, and require lower working capital requirements. The return on investment should be more than 20% by 2014, including estimated annual cost reductions of $120 million. When completed, we believe ATIs new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility will provide unsurpassed manufacturing capability and versatility in the production of a wide range of flat rolled specialty metals. We expect improved productivity, lower costs, and higher quality for our diversified product mix of flat rolled specialty metals, including nickel based and specialty alloys, titanium and titanium alloys, zirconium alloys, Precision Rolled Strip products, and stainless sheet and coiled plate products. Our new advanced hot rolling and processing facility is designed to be the most powerful mill in the world for production of specialty metals. It is designed to roll and process exceptional quality hot bands of up to 78.62 inches, or 2 meters, wide. In connection with the new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility, we announced the consolidation of our Natrona, PA grain oriented electrical steel melt shop into ATIs Brackenridge, PA melt shop. This consolidation is expected to improve the overall productivity of ATIs flat rolled grain oriented electrical steel and other stainless and specialty alloys, and reduce the cost of producing slabs and ingots. The investment should also result in significant reduction of particulate emissions. This consolidation is expected to be completed in 2010. We are increasing our capacity to produce zirconium products through capital expansions of zirconium sponge production and VAR melting. This new zirconium sponge and melting capacity better positions ATI for the current and expected strong growth in demand from the nuclear electrical energy and chemical process industry markets. Our STAL joint venture commenced an expansion of its operations in Shanghai, China in late 2006. This expansion, which is expected to more than triple STALs rolling and slitting capacity to produce Precision Rolled Strip products, is estimated to cost approximately $110 million and is expected to be operational in the first quarter 2009. We currently expect that our projected 2009 capital expenditures will be approximately $450 million, excluding the STAL joint venture, and we expect capital spending to remain in this range for the next few years as we complete these strategic projects. We are committed to continuing to self fund these projects and can further adjust the timing of any project, if necessary. Debt Total debt outstanding decreased by $18.4 million, to $509.8 million at December 31, 2008, from $528.2 million at December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily related to scheduled debt maturity payments. In managing our overall capital structure, some of the measures on which we focus are net debt to total capitalization, which is the percentage of our debt, net of cash that may be available to reduce borrowings, to our total invested and borrowed capital, and total debt to total capitalization, which excludes cash balances. Our net debt to total capitalization was 2.0%, compared to a negative 4.5% at December 31, 2007, a positive 3.3% at December 31, 2006 and 19.7% at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2007, our cash on hand exceeded our total debt. Total debt to total capitalization was 20.6% at December 31, 2008, compared to 19.2% at December 31, 2007, 26.9% at December 31, 2006, and 41.0% at December 31, 2005.

Under this facility, the Company may increase the size of the facility by up to $100 million without seeking the further approval of the lending group. The unsecured facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization) of not greater than 3.25, and maintain an interest coverage ratio (consolidated earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest expense) of not less than 2.0. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our leverage ratio was 0.55, and our interest coverage ratio was 65.06. We have not borrowed funds under the senior unsecured domestic facility during 2008, although a portion has been utilized to support the issuance of letters of credit. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the unsecured facility at December 31, 2008, were approximately $14 million, compared to $43 million at the end of 2007. In 2008, the Company established a separate credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2008, $30 million in letters of credit were outstanding under this separate facility. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 19.4. STAL, our Chinese joint venture company in which ATI has a 60% interest, has a five year revolving credit facility with a group of banks. Under the credit facility, STAL may borrow up to 585 million renminbi (approximately $85 million at December 2008 exchange rates) at an interest rate equal to 90% of the applicable lending rate published by the Peoples Bank of China. The credit facility is supported solely by STALs financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners, and is intended to be utilized in the future for the expansion of STALs operations, which are located in Shanghai, China. The credit facility requires STAL to maintain a minimum level of shareholders equity, and certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2008, there had been no borrowings made under this credit facility. STAL had approximately $6 million in letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2008. These letters of credit are supported solely by STALs financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners. Interest rate swap contracts have been used from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. At December 31, 2008, we have no interest rate swap contracts in place. We have deferred gains on settled receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts associated with our $300 million, 8.375% Notes. These gains on settlement, which occurred in 2004 and 2003, remain a component of the reported balance of the Notes, and are ratably recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes, which is approximately three years. At December 31, 2008, the deferred settlement gain was $6.7 million. The result of the receive fixed, pay floating arrangements was a decrease in interest expense of $2.0 million, $1.8 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, compared to the fixed interest expense of the ten year Notes.

These contracts are based upon fixed or variable price provisions. We used current market prices as of December 31, 2008, for raw material obligations with variable pricing. (C) We have various contractual obligations that extend through 2015 for services involving production facilities and administrative operations. Our purchase obligation as disclosed represents the estimated termination fees payable if we were to exit these contracts. (D) Drawn amounts were $21.7 million at December 31, 2008 under foreign credit agreements, and drawn amounts are included in total debt. Drawn amounts also include $13.9 million utilized under the $400 million domestic senior unsecured credit facility for standby letters of credit, which renew annually, and $29.8 million under a separate letter of credit facility. These letters of credit are used to support: $29.8 million in workers compensation and general insurance arrangements, and $13.9 million related to environmental, legal and other matters. Retirement Benefits The value of the liabilities of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan exceeded pension plan investments as of the end of 2008, by $342 million, or approximately 17%. We have not been required to make cash contributions to this defined benefit pension plan since 1995. However, during the past five years, we have made $415 million in voluntary cash and stock contributions to this plan to improve the plans funded position. These voluntary contributions were comprised of cash contributions of $30 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, and $100 million during each of the fourth quarters of 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, plus $50 million during the third quarter 2004. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2008, we contributed 1.5 million shares of ATI common stock, valued at $35.2 million, to the pension plan. Based on current regulations and actuarial studies, we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2009. However, we may elect, depending upon investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. We fund certain retiree health care benefits for Allegheny Ludlum using investments held in a Company administered Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) trust. This allows us to recover a portion of the retiree medical costs. In accordance with our labor agreements, during 2008, 2007, and 2006, we funded $34.3 million, $30.8 million, and $28.1 million, respectively, of retiree medical costs using the investments of this VEBA trust. We may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the investments held in the VEBA. The value of the investments held in the VEBA was approximately $35 million as of December 31, 2008. Dividends We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock for each quarter of 2008. The payment of dividends and the amount of such dividends depends upon matters deemed relevant by our Board of Directors, such as our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by law, credit agreements or senior securities, and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate. Share Repurchase Program On November 1, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of $500 million. Repurchases of Company common stock are expected to be made on the open market or in unsolicited or privately negotiated transactions. Share repurchases are expected to be funded from internal cash flow and cash on hand. The number of shares to be purchased, and the timing of the purchases, will be based on several factors, including other investment opportunities, the level of cash balances, and general business conditions. During 2008, 6,162,200 shares of common stock were purchased at a cost of $278.3 million. As of December 31, 2008, 6,837,000 shares of common stock had been purchased under this program at a cost of $339.5 million. Critical Accounting Policies The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality. 41 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when title passes or as services are rendered. We have no significant unusual sale arrangements with any of our customers. We market our products to a diverse customer base, principally throughout the United States. Trade credit is extended based upon evaluations of each customers ability to perform its obligations, which are updated periodically. Accounts receivable reserves are based upon an aging of accounts and a review for collectability of specific accounts. Accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $6.3 million at both December 31, 2008 and 2007, which represented 1.2% and 1.0%, respectively, of total gross accounts receivable. During 2008, we recognized expense of $2.1 million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off $2.1 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve. During 2007, we recognized expense of $1.0 million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off $0.4 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve. Inventories At December 31, 2008, we had net inventory of $887.6 million. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last in, first out (LIFO), first in, first out (FIFO) and average cost methods) or market, less progress payments. Costs include direct material, direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs. Most of our inventory is valued utilizing the LIFO costing methodology. Inventory of our non U.S. operations is valued using average cost or FIFO methods. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have been extremely volatile during the past three years. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results, while, conversely, a fall in material costs results in a benefit to operating results. For example, in 2008 and 2007, the effect of falling raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $169.0 million and $92.1 million, respectively, lower than would have been recognized had we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. However, in 2006 the effect of increases in raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $197.0 million higher than would have been recognized if we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. In a period of rising prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Conversely, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. The LIFO inventory valuation methodology is not utilized by many of the companies with which we compete, including foreign competitors. As such, our results of operations may not be comparable to those of our competitors during periods of volatile material costs due, in part, to the differences between the LIFO inventory valuation method and other acceptable inventory valuation methods. We evaluate product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value. The calculation of a resulting reserve, if any, is recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified. At December 31, 2008, no significant reserves were required. It is our general policy to write down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months. In some instances this criterion is up to twenty four months due to the longer manufacturing and distribution process for such products. Asset Impairment We monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets. An impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an assets use (including any proceeds from disposition) are less than the assets carrying value, and the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Changes in the expected use of a long lived asset group, and the financial performance of the long lived asset group and its operating segment, are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment. Future cash flow value may include appraisals for property, plant and equipment, land and improvements, future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets, and other operating considerations. There were no significant charges for impairment of long lived assets in the periods presented. Retirement Benefits We have defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all of our employees. We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (FAS 87), as amended by FAS 158 regarding the balance sheet presentation of pension assets and liabilities. FAS 87 42 Table of Contents requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. A significant element in determining our pension (expense) income in accordance with FAS 87 is the expected investment return on plan assets. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration input from our third party pension plan asset managers and actuaries regarding the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. Our expected long term return on pension plan investments has been 8.75% for each of the past five years. We apply this assumed rate to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension (expense) income for the current year. The actual return on pension plan assets was a negative 25.3% for 2008, reversing a trend of positive returns of 10.9% for 2007, 18.2% for 2006, 9.7% for 2005, and 11.7% for 2004. Based upon our strategic allocation of pension assets across the various investments asset classes, our expected long term return on pension plan investments for 2009 remains at 8.75%. The effect of increasing, or lowering, the expected return on pension plan investments by 0.25% results in additional annual income, or expense, of approximately $4.2 million. The cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods. The amount of expected return on plan assets can vary significantly from year to year since the calculation is dependent on the market value of plan assets as of the end of the preceding year. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to calculate the expected return on pension assets using either an average of fair market values of pension assets over a period not to exceed five years, which reduces the volatility in reported pension income or expense, or their fair market value at the end of the previous year. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission currently does not permit companies to change from the fair market value at the end of the previous year methodology, which is the methodology that we use, to an averaging of fair market values of plan assets methodology. As a result, our results of operations and those of other companies, including companies with which we compete, may not be comparable due to these different methodologies in calculating the expected return on pension investments. In accordance with changes in the accounting standards, we determined the discount rate used to value pension plan liabilities as of the end of 2008. Previously, we had used November 30th as our measurement date. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. In estimating this rate, we receive input from our actuaries regarding the rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments with maturities matched to the expected future retirement benefit payments. Based on this assessment at the end of December 2008, we established a discount rate of 6.85% for valuing the pension liabilities as of the end of 2008, and for determining the pension expense for 2009. We had previously assumed a discount rate of 6.25% for 2007, which determined the 2008 expense, 5.8% for 2006, which determined the 2007 expense, and 5.9% for 2005, which determined the 2006 expense. The estimated effect of changing the discount rate by 0.50%, would decrease pension liabilities in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase pension liabilities in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $100 million. Such a change in the discount rate would decrease pension expense in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase pension expense in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $8 million. The effect on pension liabilities for changes to the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, are deferred and amortized over future periods in accordance with the accounting standards. We also sponsor several postretirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees and retirees. These plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Under most of the plans, our contributions towards premiums are capped based upon the cost as of certain dates, thereby creating a defined contribution. For the non collectively bargained plans, we maintain the right to amend or terminate the plans in the future. We account for these benefits in accordance with FAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAS 106), as amended by FAS 158, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as benefits are paid. We use actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for the plans. The discount rate, which is determined annually at the end of each year, is developed based upon rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. At the end of 2008, we determined this rate to be 6.85%, compared to a 6.25% discount rate in 2007, 5.8% discount rate in 2006, and 5.9% discount rate in 2005. The estimated effect of changing the discount rate by 0.50%, would decrease postretirement obligations in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase postretirement obligations in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $18 million. Such a change in the discount rate would decrease postretirement benefit expense in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase postretirement benefit expense in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $0.5 million. Based upon predictions of continued significant medical cost inflation in future years, the annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits of health care plans is 10.37% in 2009 and is assumed to gradually decrease to 5.0% in the year 2028 and remain level thereafter. Certain of these postretirement benefits are funded using plan investments held in a Company administered VEBA trust. The expected return on plan investments is a significant element in determining postretirement benefits expenses in accordance with accounting standards. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we 43 Table of Contents take into consideration the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. For 2008, our expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 9%. This assumed long term rate of return on investments is applied to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan investments that is included in annual postretirement benefits expenses for the current year. The actual return on investments held in the VEBA trust was a negative 9.5% in 2008, reversing a trend of positive returns of 16.9% in 2007, 50.0% in 2006, and 11.6% in both 2005 and 2004. Our expected return on investments in the VEBA trust is 8.3% for 2009. The expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust is expected to be lower than the return on pension plan investments due to the mix of assets held by the VEBA trust and the reduction of VEBA trust assets due to benefit payments. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In the first quarter 2008, as required, we began the adoption process for the change in measurement date provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158), which amended the standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting. These provisions require assets and benefits to be measured at the date of the employers statement of financial position, which is December 31 in our case, rather than our measurement date of November 30, as was previously permitted. The adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). This Standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The Standard covers financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements. FAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities, and for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (FAS 159), The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities. FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. If the fair value option is elected, unrealized gains and losses will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of FAS 159 did not have an impact on our financial statements. Pending Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 (FAS 161), Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. FAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. It requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We will include the required disclosures beginning with our 2009 financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (FAS 160), Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. FAS 160 changes the classification of noncontrolling (minority) interests on the balance sheet and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests. Under the new standard, noncontrolling interests are considered equity and are to be reported as an element of stockholders equity rather than within the mezzanine or liability sections of the balance sheet. In addition, the current practice of reporting minority interest expense or benefit will change. Under the new standard, net income will encompass the total income before minority interest expense. The income statement will include separate disclosure of the attribution of income between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership interest amount are to be accounted for as equity transactions. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and earlier application is prohibited. Upon adoption, the balance sheet and the income statement will be recast retrospectively for the presentation of noncontrolling interests. The other accounting provisions of the statement are required to be adopted prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS 160, including the reporting of the minority interest in our STAL joint venture, on our financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, other long term liabilities included $68 million for minority interest in our STAL joint venture, which will be reported as an element of stockholders equity upon adoption of FAS 160. 44 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements From time to time, the Company has made and may continue to make forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements in this report relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, would, should, will, will likely result, forecast, outlook, projects, and similar expressions. Such forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which the Company is unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results or performance to materially differ from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such statements. Various of these factors are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and will be described from time to time in the Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Companys Annual Reports on Form 10 K and the Companys subsequent reports filed with the SEC on Form 10 Q and Form 8 K, which are available on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov and on the Companys website at http://www.alleghenytechnologies.com. We assume no duty to update our forward looking statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As part of our risk management strategy, we utilize derivative financial instruments, from time to time, to hedge our exposure to changes in raw material prices, foreign currencies, and interest rates. We monitor the third party financial institutions which are our counterparty to these financial instruments on a daily basis and diversify our transactions among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Fair values for derivatives were measured using exchange traded prices for the hedged items. Upon adoption of FAS 157 in 2008, fair value was determined using Level 2 information, including consideration of counterparty risk and the Companys credit risk. Interest Rate Risk. We attempt to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $46 million of floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.1%. Approximately $31 million of this floating rate debt is capped at a 6% maximum interest rate. Since the interest rate on floating rate debt changes with the short term market rate of interest, we are exposed to the risk that these interest rates may increase, raising our interest expense in situations where the interest rate is not capped. For example, a hypothetical 1% increase in the rate of interest on the $15 million of our outstanding floating rate debt not subjected to a cap would result in increased annual financing costs of approximately $0.1 million. Volatility of Energy Prices. Energy resources markets are subject to conditions that create uncertainty in the prices and availability of energy resources. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, have and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We use approximately 10 to 12 million MMBtus of natural gas annually, depending upon business conditions, in the manufacture of our products. These purchases of natural gas expose us to risk of higher gas prices. For example, a hypothetical $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of approximately $10 to $12 million. We use several approaches to minimize any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations from volatile energy prices. These approaches include incorporating an energy surcharge on many of our products and using financial derivatives to reduce exposure to energy price volatility. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding financial derivatives used to hedge our exposure to natural gas cost volatility represented approximately 30% of our forecasted requirements for the next three years. The net mark to market valuation of these outstanding hedges at December 31, 2008 was an unrealized pre tax loss of $24.3 million, of which $14.3 million was presented in accrued liabilities on the balance sheet with the remainder included in other long term liabilities. The effects of the hedging activity will be recognized in income over the designated hedge periods. For the 2008 year, the effects of natural gas hedging activity reduced cost of sales by $3.8 million. Volatility of Raw Material Prices. We use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of increased raw material costs; however, competitive factors in the marketplace can limit our ability to institute such mechanisms, and there can be a delay between the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefit of such mechanisms. For example, in 2008 we used approximately 80 million pounds of nickel; therefore a hypothetical change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately $80 million. In addition, in 2008 we also used approximately 500 million pounds of ferrous scrap in the production of our flat rolled products and a hypothetical change of $0.01 per pound would result in increased costs of approximately $5 million. While we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price 45 Table of Contents fluctuations, such as for nickel, we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure. We believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts, but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials. The majority of our products are sold utilizing raw material surcharges and index mechanisms. However as of December 31, 2008, we had entered into financial hedging arrangements primarily at the request of our customers related to firm orders for approximately 15% of our total annual nickel requirements. Any gain or loss associated with these hedging arrangements is included in the selling price to the customer requesting the hedge over the designated hedge period. At December 31, 2008, the net mark to market valuation of these outstanding hedges was an unrealized pre tax loss of $37.0 million, of which $31.6 million is included in accrued liabilities on the balance sheet with the remainder included in other long term liabilities. Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used, from time to time, to limit transactional exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We sometimes purchase foreign currency forward contracts that permit us to sell specified amounts of foreign currencies expected to be received from our export sales for pre established U.S. dollar amounts at specified dates. The forward contracts are denominated in the same foreign currencies in which export sales are denominated. These contracts are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows of a portion of the forecasted future export sales transactions which otherwise would expose the Company to foreign currency risk. In addition, we may also designate cash balances held in foreign currencies as hedges of forecasted foreign currency transactions. At December 31, 2008, the net mark to market valuation of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was an unrealized pre tax gain of $17.0 million, of which $7.0 million is included in other current assets on the balance sheet and $0.2 million is recorded in accrued liabilities, with the remainder included in other long term assets. 46 Table of Contents
