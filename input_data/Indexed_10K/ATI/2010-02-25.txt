Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements. Actual results or performance could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described below. Net income and net income per share amounts referenced below are attributable to Allegheny Technologies Incorporated. Overview of 2009 Financial Performance While 2009 presented a challenging business environment, we remained profitable and enhanced our position in key global growth markets, launched new production facilities, and maintained our strong balance sheet. Net income attributable to ATI for the full year 2009 was $31.7 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to $565.9 million, or $5.67 per share, for 2008. Results of 2009 included after tax charges of $17.0 million, or $0.17 per share, related to second quarter 2009 actions to retire debt and the tax consequences of our $350 million voluntary pension contribution. Sales in 2009 were $3.05 billion compared to $5.31 billion for 2008. Direct international sales for 2009 represented 31% of our total sales compared to 28% for 2008. For 2009, the Flat Rolled Products segment generated 48%, the High Performance Metals generated 45%, and the Engineered Products segment generated 7% of our direct international sales. Our 2009 results reflect ATIs positioning as a globally focused, diversified high value specialty metals company with strong cash flow and liquidity, and a solid balance sheet. The aerospace and defense market and the global infrastructure markets specifically, oil and gas, chemical process industry, and electrical energy, and the medical market have been driving our performance for the last 17 Table of Contents several years. For 2009, 31% of our sales were to the aerospace and defense market, 19% to the oil and gas markets and the chemical process industry, 19% to the electrical energy market, and 4% to the medical market. These major high value global markets represented 73% of ATIs 2009 sales. In our High Performance Metals segment, year over year sales decreased 33% to $1.30 billion, due primarily to lower raw material surcharges, reduced base prices, and reduced demand from the aerospace market, as the supply chain adjusted to aircraft production delays, and decreased demand from the aeroengine aftermarket and the chemical processing market as a result of the weak global economy. The declines in these markets were partially offset by increased demand for our materials from the defense and nuclear energy markets. Operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment was $234.7 million, a 56% decrease compared to 2008, due primarily to lower shipments, lower average base selling prices for most of our products as a result of a more competitive pricing environment, and idle facility, workforce reduction, and start up costs of $31.2 million. Improved margins on our exotic alloys, and benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts partially offset the profitability decline. In our Flat Rolled Products segment, sales decreased 48% to $1.52 billion primarily as a result of lower raw material surcharges and lower product shipments due to the global economic recession, and lower average base selling prices for many of our products. Total product shipments decreased 22% for the full year 2009, as demand for high value and standard stainless products remained at depressed levels. However, shipments of standard stainless products, after reaching a low in the fourth quarter of 2008, increased sequentially during 2009 as service center and other customers started to replenish inventory positions. Operating profit for the Flat Rolled Products segment was $71.3 million, an 81% decrease compared to 2008. The decline in 2009 operating profit was due primarily to lower shipments, lower average base selling prices for most of our products, and idle facility and workforce reduction costs of $19.3 million, which were partially offset by the benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts. In our Engineered Products segment, 2009 sales decreased 48% to $238.8 million primarily due to decreased demand from all the major markets for our products: oil and gas, transportation, construction and mining, and cutting tools. The significant sales decline resulted in an operating loss of $23.8 million for 2009 compared an operating profit of $20.9 million for 2008. In addition, operating results for 2009 were adversely affected by idle facility and workforce reduction costs of $5.7 million. For 2009, total segment operating profit decreased to $282.2 million compared $944.9 million for 2008. Total segment operating profit as a percentage of total sales was 9.2% in 2009, compared to 17.8% in 2008. During 2009, we enhanced our positions in key global growth markets, continued to enhance our manufacturing capabilities, reduced costs, and maintained our strong balance sheet. We also realized continued success in implementing the ATI Business System, which is continuing to drive lean manufacturing throughout our operations. Our accomplishments during 2009 from these important efforts included: We continued to grow our global market presence as direct international sales exceeded 31% of total sales. We believe at least 50% of ATIs 2009 sales were driven by global markets when we consider exports of our customers. We continued to improve our positions with key customers in the aerospace, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical markets as we entered into new long term agreements to assist them in dealing with Mission Critical Metallics, manufacturing, and certainty of supply challenges they face. We continued to expand our industry leading technology portfolio by making important research and development investments. Our new products are gaining traction in the marketplace and we are particularly pleased with the acceptance of ATI 425 alloy, an innovative new titanium alloy, ATI 718 Plus alloy, our groundbreaking nickel based superalloy, and our ATI 500 MIL alloy which is the first new armor plate product released to the market in over 40 years. These products are aimed at improving manufacturability to help customers get to near net shape quicker and at reduced costs. Our new duplex stainless alloys use lower amounts of nickel and or molybdenum. These products are designed to be more cost effective and typically provide higher strength and better corrosion resistance than conventional stainless alloys. We continued to realize significant benefits from our strategic focus on key high value specialty products, including titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and specialty alloys, exotic alloys, and grain oriented electrical steel. In 2009, sales of these key high value products represented 61% of our total sales compared to 42% in 2002, the last business cycle trough. These sales mix increases were achieved utilizing our manufacturing capabilities across both our High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products segments and demonstrate our ability to profitably supply the marketplace with both long and flat rolled products. We continued to build a foundation for profitable growth. We significantly increased strategic capital investments in our businesses to support the expected long term growth in our markets, especially for titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys. During the past five years, we have invested $1.8 billion, of which 18 Table of Contents $454 million was spent in 2009, to expand our titanium sponge production, and our melting, rolling, finishing, and product capabilities. During this same five year period, we have generated over $2.2 billion in cash flow from operations which has allowed us to self fund these important investments. Our recently completed and on going major strategic capital projects include: The expansion of ATIs aerospace quality titanium sponge production capabilities. Titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products. Our greenfield premium grade titanium sponge (jet engine rotating parts) facility in Rowley, UT commenced initial production in December 2009. We plan to ramp production at this facility during 2010 in a systematic manner to consistently provide the best quality and cost competitive product. When this Utah sponge facility is fully operational, our total annual sponge production capacity including our Albany, OR standard grade titanium sponge facility is projected to be approximately 46 million pounds. These secure supply sources are intended to reduce our purchased titanium sponge and purchased titanium scrap requirements. In addition, the Utah facility will have the infrastructure in place to further expand annual capacity by approximately 18 million pounds, bringing the total annual capacity at that facility to 42 million pounds, if needed. The design and construction of a $260 million titanium alloys and nickel based alloys and superalloys forging facility at our operations in North Carolina. This new facility, which was constructed in phases through 2009, includes a new 10,000 ton press forge and a new 700mm radial forge, both of which we believe is the largest of its kind in the world for producing these types of alloys. The facility also includes billet conditioning and finishing equipment. The conditioning, finishing and inspection assets commenced operations in the 2008 third quarter and the forging equipment commenced operations in the third quarter 2009. The design and construction of a new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility at our existing Brackenridge, PA site. The project is estimated to cost approximately $1.16 billion and take at least four years to complete. Engineering, permitting and site preparation are nearly completed for the facility. Our new advanced hot rolling and processing facility is designed to be the most powerful mill in the world for production of specialty metals. It is designed to produce exceptional quality, thinner, and wider hot rolled coils at reduced cost with shorter lead times, and require lower working capital requirements. When completed, we believe ATIs new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility will provide unsurpassed manufacturing capability and versatility in the production of a wide range of flat rolled specialty metals. We expect improved productivity, lower costs, and higher quality for our diversified product mix of flat rolled specialty metals, including nickel based and specialty alloys, titanium and titanium alloys, zirconium alloys, Precision Rolled Strip products, and stainless sheet and coiled plate products. It is designed to roll and process exceptional quality hot bands of up to 78.62 inches, or 2 meters, wide. In connection with the new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility, we are consolidating our Natrona, PA grain oriented electrical steel melt shop into ATIs Brackenridge, PA melt shop. This consolidation is expected to improve the overall productivity of ATIs flat rolled grain oriented electrical steel and other stainless and specialty alloys, and reduce the cost of producing slabs and ingots. The investment should also result in significant reduction of particulate emissions. We expect to realize considerable cost savings from this project beginning in the second half of 2010. We are increasing our capacity to produce zirconium products through capital expansions of zirconium sponge production and VAR melting. This new zirconium sponge and melting capacity better positions ATI for the current and expected strong growth in demand from the nuclear energy and chemical process industry markets. We believe ATI is now the worlds largest producer of critical reactor grade zirconium sponge for the nuclear energy market. Our Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), in which ATI has a 60% interest, completed an expansion of its Precision Rolled Strip operations in Shanghai, China which nearly triples STALs precision rolling and slitting capacity. This expansion better positions STAL to benefit from Chinas electronics and telecommunications manufacturing market for cell phones and smartphones, as well as Chinas rapidly growing automotive parts manufacturing market. We believe STAL is the largest producer of these thin strip products in China and that our new facility gives us a significant competitive advantage in this growing market. In October 2009, we acquired the assets of Crucible Compaction Metals and Crucible Research, a western Pennsylvania producer of advanced powder metal products, for approximately $39 million. This acquisition, which has been named ATI Powder Metals, expands our specialty metals product portfolio. Powder metals are used in the production of complex alloy chemistries, typically when conventional processes can not be used. Powder metals represent a growth opportunity for ATI as more powder metals are used in the aerospace industry for the latest generation of jet engines and for the production of near net shape parts. Additional markets for these powder metals products include oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical. 19 Table of Contents We currently plan to spend approximately $375 million for capital expenditures in 2010 and we expect capital spending to remain in this range for the next few years as we complete our strategic projects. We realized significant cash generation in 2009 with cash flow from operations of $218.5 million, which included a voluntary after tax cash pension contribution of $241.5 million. Excluding the voluntary net cash pension contribution, cash flow from operations was $460 million for 2009. Cash on hand at the end of 2009 was $708.8 million, an increase of $238.9 million from year end 2008. We continued to maintain our strong balance sheet. In June 2009, we completed several proactive liability management actions including the issuance of $350 million of 9.375% 10 year Senior Notes and $402.5 million of 4.25% 5 year Convertible Senior Notes. Proceeds from these transactions were used to retire $183.3 million of our outstanding 8.375% Notes due in 2011 and to fund a voluntary $350 million cash contribution to our domestic pension plan to significantly improve its funded position. At the end of 2009, our pension plan was essentially fully funded while our net debt to total capitalization ratio and our total debt to total capital ratio remained conservative at 15.3% and 34.7%, respectively. We continued to realize significant progress in safety across ATIs operations. As a result of our continuing focus on and commitment to safety, in 2009 our OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate improved by 2.4% to 2.45 and our Lost Time Case Rate was 0.38, which we believe to be competitive with world class performance. We realized continued success from the ATI Business System, which is continuing to drive lean manufacturing throughout our operations. In addition to the improved safety performance discussed above, we realized $173 million in gross cost reductions in 2009, which exceeded our goal of $100 million. We have targeted additional gross cost reductions of at least $100 million in 2010. Looking ahead, we expect to see gradual and steady improvement in most of our global markets in 2010. Further, we expect to recover and profitably grow faster than our core global markets as a result of our new and extended long term agreements and innovative new products that improve our market position, and our leading manufacturing capabilities. We continue to believe that the aerospace and defense and global infrastructure markets, namely chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical, have strong growth potential over the intermediate and long term. We intend to use these difficult market conditions to continue to positively differentiate ATI as a uniquely positioned, diversified, technology driven global specialty metals producer. Results of Operations Sales were $3.05 billion in 2009, $5.31 billion in 2008 and $5.45 billion in 2007. Direct international sales represented approximately 31% of 2009 sales, 28% of 2008 sales and 27% of 2007 sales. Segment operating profit was $282.2 million in 2009, $944.9 million in 2008, and $1.27 billion in 2007. Our measure of segment operating profit, which we use to analyze the performance and results of our business segments, excludes income taxes, corporate expenses, net interest expense, retirement benefit expense, other costs net of gains on asset sales and restructuring costs, if any. We believe segment operating profit, as defined, provides an appropriate measure of controllable operating results at the business segment level. Income before tax was $64.9 million in 2009, $867.7 million in 2008, and $1.15 billion in 2007. Net income attributable to ATI was $31.7 million for 2009, $565.9 million for 2008, and $747.1 million for 2007. We operate in three business segments: High Performance Metals, Flat Rolled Products and Engineered Products. These segments represented the following percentages of our total revenues and segment operating profit for the years indicated: 2009 2008 2007 Operating Operating Operating Revenue Profit (Loss) Revenue Profit Revenue Profit High Performance Metals 43 % 83 % 37 % 58 % 38 % 58 % Flat Rolled Products 49 % 25 % 55 % 40 % 54 % 40 % Engineered Products 8 % (8 %) 8 % 2 % 8 % 2 % 20 Table of Contents Information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. High Performance Metals (In millions) 2009 %Change 2008 %Change 2007 Sales to external customers $ 1,300.0 (33 %) $ 1,944.9 (6 %) $ 2,067.6 Operating profit 234.7 (56 %) 539.0 (26 %) 729.1 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 18.1 % 27.7 % 35.3 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 32.8 % 30.0 % 32.0 % Our High Performance Metals segment produces, converts and distributes a wide range of high performance alloys, including titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel and cobalt based alloys and superalloys, exotic alloys such as zirconium, hafnium, niobium, nickel titanium, and their related alloys, and other specialty metals, primarily in long product forms such as ingot, billet, bar, rod, wire, shapes and rectangles, seamless tube and castings. These products are designed for the high performance requirements of such major end markets as aerospace and defense, electrical energy, oil and gas, chemical process industry, and medical. The operating units in this segment are ATI Allvac, ATI Allvac Ltd (U.K.), ATI Wah Chang and ATI Powder Metals. 2009 Compared to 2008 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment for 2009 decreased 33% to $1.30 billion, due primarily to reduced demand from the aerospace market, as the supply chain adjusted to aircraft production delays, and decreased demand from the aeroengine aftermarket and the chemical processing market as a result of the weak global economy. The declines in these markets were partially offset by increased demand for our materials from the defense and nuclear energy markets. Direct international sales as percentage of total segment sales increased to 32.8% primarily due to sales of exotic alloys. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 %Change Volume (000s pounds): Titanium mill products 23,588 32,530 (27 %) Nickel based and specialty alloys 32,562 42,525 (23 %) Exotic alloys 5,067 5,473 (7 %) Average prices (per pound): Titanium mill products $ 20.92 $ 25.60 (18 %) Nickel based and specialty alloys $ 14.43 $ 18.14 (20 %) Exotic alloys $ 57.79 $ 48.53 19 % Aerospace represents a significant market for our High Performance Metals segment, especially for premium quality specialty metals used in the manufacture of jet engines for the original equipment and spare parts markets. In addition, we have become a larger supplier of specialty metals used in airframe construction. In 2009, sales of our material into the airframe market represented approximately 38% of our aerospace market sales. Over the past several years, we have entered into long term agreements with our customers to assist them in dealing with Mission Critical Metallics, manufacturing, and certainty of supply challenges they face. In September 2009, we signed a ten year sourcing agreement with Rolls Royce plc for the supply of nickel based superalloy disc quality products for commercial jet engine applications with potential revenue estimated to be between $750 million and $1 billion. In January 2007, we announced a long term sourcing agreement with GE Aviation for the supply of premium titanium alloys, nickel based superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys products for commercial and military jet engine applications. Historical and anticipated revenues under this agreement plus ATI Allvacs direct sales to GE Aviation for the period 2007 through 2011 could exceed $2 billion. In addition, in October 2006 we announced a long term agreement with The Boeing Company to supply titanium alloys products for Boeings aircraft airframes and structural components, including Boeings 787 Dreamliner. Total revenues under this contract may be as much as $2.5 billion for the years 2007 through 2015. This long term agreement includes both long product forms which are manufactured within the High Performance Metals segment, and a significant amount of plate products which are manufactured utilizing assets of both the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products segments. Revenues and profits associated with these titanium mill products covered by the long term agreement are included primarily in the results for the High Performance Metals segment. 21 Table of Contents The commercial aerospace markets use of titanium alloys is expected to increase significantly as new aircraft airframe designs use a larger percentage of titanium alloys. For example, the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner airframe (excluding engines) is expected to require the purchase of approximately 250,000 pounds of titanium alloy mill products per aircraft, a significant increase over any previous commercial aircraft airframe. New aircraft designs from Airbus, the A380 and A350 XWB, and from defense contractors are also expected to utilize a greater percentage of titanium alloys. Given the significant current backlogs of Boeing and Airbus, as well as the engine manufacturers, this increasing demand for titanium alloys mill products is expected to last into the next decade. However, The Boeing Company has experienced production difficulties with the construction of the new Boeing 787 which have delayed the planned first delivery of this new aircraft to the fourth quarter of 2010, a delay of over 2 years. These production difficulties, along with decreased demand in the aeroengine aftermarket due to weakness in the global economy, resulted in excess availability of materials in the aerospace supply chain. This excess availability of material has had an adverse effect in 2009 and 2008 on the demand and selling prices for certain of the materials we produce, especially titanium alloys and nickel based superalloys. This supply condition also resulted in the temporarily idling our Albany, OR titanium sponge facility at the end of July 2009 to adjust titanium production and inventory levels to current market demand. For the period from 2004 to 2008, airline revenue passenger miles and freight miles have increased annually 5.4% and 2.4%, respectively, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data. In 2009, airline revenue passenger miles and freight miles decreased 4.1% and 13.0%. Based on January 2010 forecasts, the ICAO expects growth of between 4.5% and 7.0% annually for the next 4 years based on the demand for passenger and freight travel from developing economies, especially in Asia and the Middle East, and expected continuing economic growth in the rest of the world. New commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries have increased 4.5% annually since 2005. Independent forecasts from both Airline Monitor and Forecast International project a reduction in deliveries in 2010 followed by continuing growth of commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries for the next 4 years. Because of the current economic downturn, the actual rate and timing of future aircraft deliveries is uncertain. Due to manufacturing cycle times, demand for our specialty metals leads the deliveries of new aircraft by 12 to 18 months. In addition, as our specialty metals are used in rotating components of jet engines, demand for our products for spare parts is impacted by aircraft flight activity and engine refurbishment requirements of U.S. and foreign aviation regulatory authorities.

Improved margins on our exotic alloys, and benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts partially offset the profitability decline. In addition, operating profit over the past several years has been affected by volatile raw material costs. Titanium and titanium scrap prices decreased significantly in 2009 and 2008. These and other raw material costs are largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material indices which attempt to match purchased material costs with shipments. However in an environment of rapidly declining, or increasing costs, these raw material indices included in product selling prices may not completely match related raw material costs due to the long manufacturing times for some of our products. The rapid decrease in raw material costs in late 2008 had a significant negative effect on operating profit as shipments produced with raw material purchased earlier in the year at higher costs were sold based upon raw material indices which reflected lower raw material prices. These negative impacts on operating profit were offset by LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefits of $33.0 million in 2009 and $70.6 million in 2008. 24 Table of Contents We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2009. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled approximately $81 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $33 million from procurement savings, $30 million from operating efficiencies, $11 million from other fixed cost savings, and $7 million from reductions in compensation and benefit expenses. Cost reductions include savings from reducing the size of the workforce by approximately 17%. On October 23, 2009, we expanded our specialty metals product portfolio by acquiring the assets of Crucible Compaction Metals and Crucible Research, a western Pennsylvania producer of advanced powder metal products, for approximately $39 million in cash. Results for these operations, which have been named ATI Powder Metals, have been included in the High Performance Metals segment results from the date of acquisition. 2008 Compared to 2007 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment decreased 6% to $1.94 billion in 2008, due primarily to decreased demand from the aerospace and defense market, primarily as a result of delays in aircraft build schedules and the weakening global economy, and the softening demand in the oil and gas market as a result of the rapid decline in crude oil and natural gas prices in the second half of 2008 due to the weakening global economy. The declines in these markets were partially offset by increased demand for our exotic materials, especially from the chemical process industry and nuclear energy markets. While our direct international sales of exotic material increased 8%, overall direct international sales decreased $77.8 million, or 12%, to $583.0 million, and represented 30% of sales for the High Performance Metals segment. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Volume (000s pounds): Titanium mill products 32,530 30,689 6 % Nickel based and specialty alloys 42,525 44,688 (5 %) Exotic alloys 5,473 5,169 6 % Average prices (per pound): Titanium mill products $ 25.60 $ 30.14 (15 %) Nickel based and specialty alloys $ 18.14 $ 19.16 (5 %) Exotic alloys $ 48.53 $ 41.85 16 % Segment operating profit for 2008 decreased 26% to $539.0 million compared to 2007 primarily due to lower volume and average selling prices for our nickel based alloys and specialty alloys, and lower average selling prices for our titanium alloys, which were partially offset by increased shipments of our titanium and exotic alloys, and the benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts. In addition, operating profit in 2008 and 2007 was affected by volatile raw material costs. Nickel and nickel bearing scrap, and titanium and titanium scrap prices decreased significantly in 2008 and the second of half of 2007 after increasing significantly during the first half of 2007. These material costs are largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material indices which attempt to match purchased material costs with shipments. However in an environment of rapidly declining, or increasing costs, these raw material indices included in product selling prices may not completely match related raw material costs. The fall in raw material costs in 2008 and in the second half of 2007 had a significant negative effect on operating profit as shipments produced with raw material purchased earlier in the year at higher costs were sold based upon raw material indices which reflected lower raw material prices. These negative impacts on operating profit were offset by LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefits of $70.6 million in 2008 and $96.3 million in 2007. We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2008. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled approximately $65 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $55 million from operating efficiencies and procurement savings, and $10 million from reductions in compensation and benefit expenses. Flat Rolled Products (In millions) 2009 % Change 2008 % Change 2007 Sales to external customers $ 1,516.1 (48 %) $ 2,909.1 (1 %) $ 2,951.9 Operating profit 71.3 (81 %) 377.4 (25 %) 505.2 Operating profit as a percentage of sales 4.7 % 13.0 % 17.1 % Direct international sales as a percentage of sales 30.0 % 26.8 % 23.1 % 25 Table of Contents Our Flat Rolled Products segment produces, converts and distributes stainless steel, nickel based alloys, specialty alloys, and titanium and titanium based alloys, in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip products, as well as grain oriented electrical steel sheet. The major end markets for our flat rolled products are electrical energy, oil and gas, chemical processing, automotive, food processing equipment and appliances, construction and mining, electronics, communication equipment and computers, and aerospace and defense. The operations in this segment are ATI Allegheny Ludlum, our 60% interest in the Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), and our 50% interest in the industrial titanium joint venture known as Uniti LLC. The remaining 40% interest in STAL is owned by the Baosteel Group, a state authorized investment company whose equity securities are publicly traded in the Peoples Republic of China. The financial results of STAL are consolidated into the segments operating results with the 40% interest of our minority partner recognized in the consolidated statement of income as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The remaining 50% interest in Uniti LLC is held by VSMPO, a Russian producer of titanium, aluminum, and specialty steel products. We account for the results of the Uniti joint venture using the equity method since we do not have a controlling interest. 2009 Compared to 2008 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2009 were $1.52 billion, or 48% lower than 2008, due primarily to lower raw material surcharges and lower product shipments as a result of the global economic recession. Total product shipments decreased 22% for the full year 2009, as demand for high value and standard stainless products remained at depressed levels. However, shipments of standard stainless products, after reaching a low in the fourth quarter of 2008, increased sequentially during 2009 as service center and other customers started to replenish inventory positions. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change Volume (000s pounds): High value 367,195 500,375 (27 %) Standard 474,950 584,389 (19 %) Total Flat Rolled Products 842,145 1,084,764 (22 %) Average prices (per pound): High value $ 2.49 $ 3.26 (24 %) Standard $ 1.22 $ 2.13 (43 %) Total Flat Rolled Products $ 1.77 $ 2.65 (33 %) The average transaction prices to customers, which include the effect of lower average raw material surcharges, decreased by 33% to $1.77 per pound in 2009. Direct international sales as a percentage of total segment sales increased to 30% in 2009, which represented a historic high. While the majority of direct international sales were for high value products, sales of standard products, primarily stainless steel cold roll sheet, are increasing in significance. Our Flat Rolled Products segment high value product shipments, which include engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip, super stainless steel, nickel based alloys, specialty alloys, titanium, and grain oriented electrical steel products, decreased 27% in 2009 while average transaction prices for these high value products decreased 24%. Demand for our engineered strip and Precision Rolled Strip, while lower than 2008, improved throughout 2009 as customers restocked inventory positions and demand improved from the housing market for energy efficient material. Demand for our titanium products from the chemical process industry and oil and gas markets was negatively impacted weakness in the global economy and uncertainty in financial markets for project financing. Shipments of our grain oriented electrical steel products, while negatively impacted by the downturn in residential and commercial construction, benefited from our long term supply agreements with key customers. Shipments of titanium and ATI produced Uniti titanium products declined 30% to approximately 10.3 million pounds in 2009. Shipments of our standard products, which primarily include stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, and stainless steel plate, decreased 19% while average transaction prices for these products decreased by 43%. In 2009, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products decreased by more than 25%, compared to 2008 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA), using annualized October 2009 information. The 2009 annual consumption of 930 million tons is the lowest level in at least 15 years. 26 Table of Contents US ADC of Stainless Sheet and Strip (hot rolled and cold rolled) 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009* Millions of Tons 1.82 1.90 1.88 1.55 1.58 1.57 1.81 1.62 1.84 1.52 1.25 0.93 * 2009 represents Oct YTD annualized Source: SSINA The majority of our flat rolled products are sold at prices that include surcharges for raw materials, including purchased scrap, that are required to manufacture our products. These raw materials include nickel, iron, chromium, and molybdenum. Nickel, which comprises a significant percentage of our material costs, continued to be volatile during 2009. The cost of nickel increased 103% during the first eight months of 2009 to an average monthly cost of $8.91 per pound in August 2009. During the next four months of 2009, the cost of nickel declined 13% to an average monthly cost of $7.74 per pound in December 2009. Our other major raw materials were also volatile during 2009 with chromium declining 14%, and iron and molybdenum increasing 29% and 19%, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Iron Scrap Prices ($/Gross Ton) 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 129 85 74 105 173 233 255 229 297 221 275 Nickel Prices ($/lb) 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 3.67 3.32 2.69 3.26 6.43 6.25 6.09 15.68 11.79 4.39 7.74 Source: London Metals Exchange 28 Table of Contents Chromium Prices ($/lb) 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0.39 0.41 0.29 0.35 0.54 0.69 0.54 0.66 1.71 1.03 0.89 Source: Platts Metals Week Molybdenum Prices ($/lb) 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2.56 2.23 2.36 3.26 7.26 31.24 26.58 24.78 32.38 9.60 11.38 Source: Platts Metals Week Operating income was $71.3 million, an 81% decrease compared to 2008. The decline in 2009 operating profit was due primarily to lower shipments, lower average base selling prices for most of our products, and idle facility and workforce reduction costs of $19.3 million, which were partially offset by the benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts. In addition, operating profit in 2009 and 2008 was affected by volatile raw material costs. Nickel and nickel bearing scrap, iron scrap, chromium, and molybdenum prices decreased significantly in 2008, especially in the fourth quarter. These material costs are largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material surcharges which attempt to match purchased material costs with shipments. However in an environment of rapidly declining, or increasing costs, these raw material indices included in product selling prices may not completely match our raw material costs due to the long manufacturing cycle times for some of our products. The rapid fall in raw material costs in 2008 had a significant negative effect on operating profit in 2008, and in the first half of 2009, as shipments produced with raw material purchased earlier at higher costs were sold based upon raw material surcharges which reflected lower raw material costs. This negative impact on operating profit was offset by a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $60.8 million in 2009 and $89.8 million in 2008. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our flat rolled products operations. In 2009, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $77 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $62 million from procurement savings and operating efficiencies and $15 million from reductions in compensation and benefit expenses. Cost reductions include the savings from reducing the size of the workforce by approximately 14%. 2008 Compared to 2007 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2008 were $2.91 billion, or 1% lower than 2007, due primarily to lower average base selling prices and raw material surcharges for most products, which were partially offset by increased product shipments. While total product shipments increased 3% for the full year 2008, demand for many of our products declined significantly in the second half of 29 Table of Contents 2008, and especially in the fourth quarter, as a result of the worsening effects of the financial credit crisis and the weakening global economy. Demand for our high value products, such as specialty alloys and titanium sheet, and grain oriented electrical steel, improved during the first nine months of 2008 from the global electrical energy, oil and gas, and chemical process industry markets but softened in the fourth quarter. Shipments of standard stainless products increased 5% for the full year but declined significantly in the second half of 2008 as demand from service center and other customers weakened considerably. Comparative information on the segments products for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007% Change Volume (000s pounds): High value 500,375 491,891 2 % Standard 584,389 557,016 5 % Total Flat Rolled Products 1,084,764 1,048,907 3 % Average prices (per pound): High value $ 3.26 $ 3.22 1 % Standard $ 2.13 $ 2.40 (11 %) Total Flat Rolled Products $ 2.65 $ 2.79 (5 %) Total shipments in 2008 increased by 3% to 1,085 million pounds compared to shipments of 1,049 million pounds in 2007. The average transaction prices to customers, which include the effect of lower average raw material surcharges, decreased by 5% to $2.65 per pound in 2008. Our direct international sales increased $100.3 million, or 15%, to a record $780.7 million, and represented 27% of sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment. While the majority of direct international sales were for high value products, sales of standard products, primarily stainless steel cold roll sheet, increased to $184 million, which represents an increase of approximately 124% since 2006. Our Flat Rolled Products segment high value product shipments, which include engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip products, super stainless steel, nickel based alloys, specialty alloys, titanium, and grain oriented electrical steel products, increased 2% while average transaction prices for these high value products increased 1%. Strong demand for our titanium products from the chemical process industry, and oil and gas markets, and for our grain oriented electrical steel products from the electrical energy distribution market was offset by lower demand for our engineered strip, Precision Rolled Strip products, nickel based alloys, and super stainless steel products. Shipments of titanium and ATI produced Uniti titanium products grew 41% to approximately 14.7 million pounds, and shipments of our grain oriented electrical steel products grew 9%, both compared to 2007. Shipments of our standard products, which primarily include stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet, and stainless steel plate, increased 5% while average transaction prices for these products decreased by 11%. In 2008, consumption in the U.S. of stainless steel strip, sheet and plate products decreased by more than 14%, compared to 2007 consumption, according to the Specialty Steel Institute of North America (SSINA). The decrease in shipments was primarily attributable to weakening demand from consumer and industrial markets due to the U.S. recession and inventory adjustments by service center customers primarily for stainless steel sheet. The majority of our flat rolled products are sold at prices that include surcharges for raw materials, including purchased scrap, that are required to manufacture our products. These raw materials include nickel, iron, chromium, and molybdenum. Nickel, which comprises a significant percentage of our material costs, continued to be volatile during 2008. The cost of nickel increased 20% during the first three months of 2008 to an average monthly cost of $14.16 per pound in March 2008. However, during the next nine months of 2008, the cost of nickel declined 69% to an average monthly cost of $4.39 per pound in December 2008. The 2008 fourth quarter was an exceptional period of volatility for our other major raw materials: iron, chromium, and molybdenum which declined in value during the quarter by approximately 60%, 52%, and 71%, respectively. Operating income was $377.4 million, a 25% decrease compared to 2007. The decline in 2008 operating profit was due primarily to lower average base selling prices for most of our products, which was partially offset by increased shipments and the benefits from our gross cost reduction initiatives. In addition, operating profit in 2008 and 2007 was affected by volatile raw material costs. Nickel and nickel bearing scrap, iron scrap, chromium, and molybdenum prices decreased significantly in 2008, especially in the fourth quarter. These material costs are largely recovered in product selling prices through raw material surcharges which attempt to match purchased material costs with shipments. However in an environment of rapidly declining, or increasing costs, these raw material indices included in product selling prices may not completely match our raw material costs due to the long manufacturing cycle times for some of our products. The rapid fall in raw material costs in 2008 had a significant, negative effect on operating profit as shipments produced with raw material purchased earlier in the year at higher costs were sold based upon raw material surcharges which reflected lower raw material costs. This negative impact on operating profit was offset by a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $89.8 million in 2008. During 2007, the average cost of our raw materials in our Flat Rolled Products segment increased 30 Table of Contents approximately 6% compared to the 2006 average cost. These increased costs, largely offset by lower inventory quantities, resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation charge of $1.9 million for 2007. We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our flat rolled products operations. In 2008, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $59 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $52 million from procurement savings and operating efficiencies and $7 million from reductions in compensation and benefit expenses. In the first quarter 2007, we entered into a new labor agreement with the United Steelworkers represented at ATIs Allegheny Ludlum operations. The new agreement expires on June 30, 2011. The new agreement provides for profit sharing above specified minimum pre tax profit for the Flat Rolled Products segment and is capped to provide for no more than $20 million of profit sharing payments under this provision over the four year life of the contract. Any profit sharing payments under this provision are contributed to an independently administered VEBA (Voluntary Employee Benefit Association) trust. As a result of this new agreement, we recognized a non recurring pre tax charge of $4.8 million.

The segment also produces carbon alloy steel impression die forgings, and large grey and ductile iron castings, and provides precision metals processing services. The operations in this segment are ATI Metalworking Products, ATI Portland Forge, ATI Casting Service and ATI Rome Metals. The major markets served by our products of the Engineered Products segment include a wide variety of industrial markets including oil and gas, machine and cutting tools, transportation, construction and mining, electrical energy, aerospace and defense, and automotive. 2009 Compared to 2008 Sales for the Engineered Products segment decreased 48% to $238.8 million in 2009 as the global economic recession severely depressed demand and selling prices of most of our products from all of our major markets. The significant sales decline resulted in an operating loss of $23.8 million for 2009 compared an operating profit of $20.9 million for 2008. Operating results for 2009 were adversely affected by idle facility and workforce reduction costs of $5.7 million. The decline in profitability was partially offset by a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $9.0 million primarily as a result of lower raw material costs and the benefits of gross cost reductions. In 2008, operating profit included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $8.6 million. In 2009, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $14 million in our Engineered Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $8 million from procurement savings and operating efficiencies, and $6 million from lower compensation and benefit expenses. Cost reductions include savings associated with reducing the size of the workforce by approximately 36%. 2008 Compared to 2007 Sales for the Engineered Products segment increased $22.7 million to $455.7 million in 2008. Demand for our tungsten and tungsten carbide products improved from the cutting tool, construction and mining, and electrical energy markets, but was lower from the oil and gas market for down hole drilling applications. Demand increased for our forged products from the transportation market. Demand for our cast products improved from the electrical energy market for wind and natural gas power generation applications. Demand remained steady for our titanium precision metal processing conversion services, primarily due to the aerospace market. While total sales increased 5% for full year 2008, demand for many of our products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the worsening effects of the financial credit crisis and the weakening global economy. 31 Table of Contents Segment operating profit in 2008 declined to $20.9 million, or 4.6% of sales, compared to $32.1 million, or 7.4% of sales for 2007. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment for our tungsten and tungsten carbide products, higher raw material costs and $4.7 million of start up expenses associated with our Alpena, MI casting operation. This decline was partially offset by increased shipment volumes and the benefits of gross cost reductions. In addition, a rapid decline during the 2008 fourth quarter in raw material costs, primarily tungsten scrap, cobalt, and forging steel, resulted in higher cost material purchased earlier in the year flowing through cost of sales and not matching raw material surcharges included in selling prices due to manufacturing cycle time. This compression in profit margins was partially offset by a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $8.6 million. In 2007, operating profit included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $2.3 million as a result of higher raw material costs and inventory levels. In 2008, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $10 million in our Engineered Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $7 million from operating efficiencies and procurement savings and $3 million from lower compensation and benefit expenses. Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were $53.1 million in 2009 compared to $56.8 million in 2008, and $73.8 million in 2007. The decline in corporate expenses year over year was primarily the result of lower expenses associated with annual and long term performance based incentive compensation programs. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net of interest income and interest capitalization, was $19.3 million for 2009 compared to $3.5 million for 2008 and $4.8 million for 2007. The increase in interest expense in 2009 was primarily due to debt issuances completed in the 2009 second quarter. Interest expense is presented net of interest income of $2.1 million for 2009, $9.8 million for 2008, and $26.0 million for 2007. The decline in interest income over the periods was primarily resulted from lower interest rates on invested cash offsetting the favorable benefit of higher cash balances. Increased capital expenditures associated with strategic investments to expand our production capabilities resulted in higher interest capitalization in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Interest expense in 2009, 2008, and 2007 was reduced by $39.0 million, $25.0 million, and $9.8 million, respectively, related to interest capitalization on major strategic capital projects. In prior years, we entered into receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts related to our $300 million, 8.375% 10 year Notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes), which were later settled, resulting in a gain. The settlement gain is being amortized into income as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2011 Notes. Interest expense decreased by $1.3 million in 2009, $2.0 million in 2008, and $1.8 million in 2007 due to these previously settled interest rate swap agreements. In June 2009, we completed the issuance of $350 million of new 9.375% 10 year Senior Notes and a tender offer for our existing 2011 Notes. As a result of the tender offer, in June 2009 we retired $183.3 million of the 2011 Notes, which resulted in a special charge for debt extinguishment of $9.2 million pre tax, or $5.5 million after tax, in the second quarter 2009. Other Expenses, Net of Gains on Asset Sales Other expenses, net of gains on asset sales, includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations, pretax gains and losses on the sale of surplus real estate, non strategic investments and other assets, and other non operating income or expense. These items are presented primarily in selling and administrative expenses, and in other income in the consolidated statements of income and resulted in net charges of $13.8 million in 2009, $8.5 million in 2008 and $10.2 million in 2007. Other expenses for 2009, 2008 and 2007 primarily related to legal costs associated with closed operations. Retirement Benefit Expense Retirement benefit expense, which includes pension and postretirement medical benefits, increased in 2009 after declining from 2004 through 2008. The increase in retirement benefit expense in 2009 was primarily due to lower returns on plan assets in 2008, which was partially offset by the benefits of voluntary pension contributions made over the last several years. During the past six years, we have made $765.2 million of voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, including $350 million in the second quarter of 2009. The decline in retirement benefit expense from 2004 through 2008 primarily resulted from actual returns on plan assets exceeding expected returns, and the positive benefits of voluntary pension contributions. Retirement benefit expense 32 Table of Contents was $121.9 million for 2009, $8.4 million for 2008, and $30.3 million for 2007. Retirement benefit expenses are included in both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses. Retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses for the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cost of sales $ 85.4 $ 5.3 $ 20.3 Selling and administrative expenses 36.5 3.1 10 Total retirement benefit expense $ 121.9 $ 8.4 $ 30.3 Total retirement benefit expense for 2010 is expected to decrease to approximately $90 million, a $31.9 million reduction from 2009. We expect pension expense to decline to approximately $71.4 million, a decrease of $27.2 million compared to pension expense of $98.6 million in 2009. This expected decrease is a result of the benefit of higher than expected returns on pension plan assets in 2009 and the benefits resulting from our $350 million voluntary pension contribution made in the second quarter 2009, partially offset by utilizing a lower discount rate to value the plans obligations. Income Taxes Net income for 2009 included a provision for income taxes of $26.9 million, or 41.4% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The 2009 provision for income taxes included a non recurring charge of $11.5 million recognized in the second quarter 2009 primarily associated with the tax consequences of the June 2009 $350 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan. Results of operations for 2008 included a provision for income taxes of $294.2 million, or 33.9% of income before tax. The results for 2008 benefited from a $11.9 million favorable adjustment of prior years taxes. Results of operations for 2007 included a provision for income taxes of $400.2 million, or 34.9% of income before tax. The results for 2007 benefited from a $23.1 million reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance with respect to certain state tax credits expected to be realized in future periods. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. At December 31, 2009, we had a net deferred tax asset of $39.4 million. A significant portion of our deferred tax assets relates to retirement benefit obligations, which have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements but which are not recognized for income tax reporting purposes until the benefits are paid. These benefit payments are expected to occur over an extended period of years. Financial Condition and Liquidity We believe that internally generated funds, current cash on hand, and available borrowings under existing credit lines will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs, including a substantial expansion of our production capabilities over the next few years. We did not borrow funds under our domestic senior unsecured credit facility during 2009, 2008, or 2007. However, as of December 31, 2009 approximately $10 million of this facility was utilized to support letters of credit. If we needed to obtain additional financing using the credit markets, the cost and the terms and conditions of such borrowings may be influenced by our credit rating. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys Investor Services senior unsecured debt rating for our Company was Baa3 with a stable ratings outlook. As of December 31, 2009, Standard Poors Ratings Services corporate credit and senior unsecured debt rating for our Company was BBB with a stable ratings outlook. Changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to, or the cost of, our existing credit facilities. We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S K. Cash Flow and Working Capital Cash flow from operations for 2009 was $218.5 million, which includes a reduction in managed working capital of $350.5 million due to lower business activity and raw material costs, partially offset by a voluntary net cash pension contribution of $241.5 million ($350 million contribution less $108.5 million U.S. Federal income tax refund). Excluding the voluntary net cash pension contribution, cash flow from operations was $460 million for 2009. During 2009 we invested $454.3 in capital expenditures, including approximately $39 million for the acquisition of a specialty powder metals business. Cash provided by financing activities was $474.1 million in 2009 due to receipt of $734.4 million of net proceeds from the second quarter 2009 debt issuances, partially offset by debt retirements of $188.8 million and dividend payments of $70.6 million. At December 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents on hand totaled $708.8 million, an increase of $238.9 million from year end 2008. 33 Table of Contents In 2008, cash generated by operations of $784.5 million was used to invest $515.7 million in capital expenditures, repurchase $278.3 million of the Companys common stock, pay dividends of $71.4 million, and fund a $30 million voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, decreasing our cash balance $153.4 million, to $469.9 million at December 31, 2008. In 2007, cash generated by operations of $809.8 million and the proceeds from the exercises of stock options of $5.5 million were used to invest $457.1 million in capital expenditures and purchases of businesses, fund a $100 million voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, purchase $61.2 million of the Companys common stock, pay dividends of $58.1 million, repay debt of $23.9 million, and increase cash balances by $121.0 million to $623.3 million at December 31, 2007. We use cash flow from operations before voluntary pension plan contributions in order to evaluate and compare fiscal periods that do not include these contributions, and to make resource allocation decisions among operational requirements, investing and financing alternatives. Managed Working Capital As part of managing the liquidity of the business, we focus on controlling inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. In measuring performance in controlling this managed working capital, we exclude the effects of the LIFO inventory valuation reserves, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which, due to their nature, are managed separately. We also measure managed working capital as a percentage of the prior two months annualized sales to evaluate our performance based on recent levels of business volume. 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 Millions/$ 576 853 1,048 1,582 1,627 1,412 1,061 % of Annualized Revenue 30.7 % 29.5 % 30.3 % 29.0 % 32.2 % 35.2 % 34.5 % In 2009, managed working capital, which we define as gross inventory plus gross accounts receivable less accounts payable, decreased by $350.5 million due to lower business activity and decreased costs for certain raw materials. The decline in managed 34 Table of Contents working capital was a source of cash in 2009, as gross inventory declined $184.0 million, accounts receivable declined $137.8 million, and accounts payable increased $28.7 million. Managed working capital was also a source of $214.8 million of cash in 2008 due to declining business levels, primarily in the fourth quarter 2008, and lower raw material costs. During 2008, gross inventory declined $203.5 million and accounts receivable declined $124.9 million, which was partially offset by an accounts payable decrease of $82.0 million. In 2007, the favorable impact of improved operating results on cash flow from operations was offset by continuing investment in managed working capital of $44.3 million to support the higher business levels and the effect of higher costs for certain raw materials. Managed working capital has increased approximately $485 million over the past six years. Increases in managed working capital are expected to represent a future source of cash if the level of business activity declines. Managed working capital as a percent of annualized sales was 34.5% at the end of 2009, compared to 35.2% at the end of 2008, and 32.2% at the end of 2007. Managed working capital as a percentage of sales has increased from historical levels due to a continuing shift in mix to more value added products, primarily in the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products business segments, which have a longer manufacturing process. Days sales outstanding, which measures actual collection timing for accounts receivable, increased slightly in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of increased international sales which have longer delivery schedules. Gross inventory turns, which excludes the effect of LIFO inventory valuation reserves, declined across all of our business segments due to significantly lower business activity. The Components of managed working capital were as follows: December 31, December 31, December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Accounts receivable $ 392.0 $ 530.5 $ 652.2 Inventory 825.5 887.6 916.1 Accounts payable (308.6 ) (278.5 ) (388.4 ) Subtotal 908.9 1,139.6 1,179.9 Allowance for doubtful accounts 6.5 6.3 6.3 LIFO reserve 102.8 205.6 374.6 Corporate and other 43.0 60.2 65.7 Managed working capital $ 1,061.2 $ 1,411.7 $ 1,626.5 Annualized prior 2 months sales $ 3,076.4 $ 4,008.0 $ 5,058.5 Managed working capital as a % of annualized sales 34.5 % 35.2 % 32.2 % Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures, including the acquisition of businesses, for 2009 were $454.3 million, compared to $515.7 million in 2008, and $447.4 million in 2007. Over the past five years, we have generated $2.2 billion in cash provided by operating activities and invested $1.8 billion in capital projects and for the acquisition of businesses. At the end of 2009, capital expenditures over the past five years represented 55% of total property, plant and equipment before accumulated depreciation. This percentage is a significant indicator of the modern nature of the Companys productive capacity. We have significantly expanded and continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet current and expected demand growth from the aerospace (engine and airframe) and defense, oil and gas, chemical process industry, electrical energy, and medical markets, especially for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, specialty alloys, and exotic alloys. These self funded capital investments include: The expansion of ATIs aerospace quality titanium sponge production capabilities. Titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products. Our greenfield premium grade titanium sponge (jet engine rotating parts) facility in Rowley, UT commenced initial production in December 2009. We plan to ramp production at this facility during 2010 in a systematic manner to consistently provide the best quality and cost competitive product. When this Utah sponge facility is fully operational, our total annual sponge production capacity including our Albany, OR standard grade titanium sponge facility is projected to be approximately 46 million pounds. These secure supply sources are intended to reduce our purchased titanium sponge and purchased titanium scrap requirements. In addition, the Utah facility will have the infrastructure in place to further expand annual capacity by approximately 18 million pounds, bringing the total annual capacity at that facility to 42 million pounds, if needed. At the end of July 2009, we temporarily idled our Albany, OR titanium sponge facility to adjust production and inventory levels to current market demand for titanium and titanium based products. 35 Table of Contents The expansion of ATIs mill products processing and finishing capabilities for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and specialty alloys. Projects include a $260 million expansion of our titanium and superalloy forging capacity at our Bakers, NC facility through the addition of an integrated 10,000 ton press forge, 700mm radial forge, and conditioning, finishing and inspection facilities to produce large diameter products needed for certain demanding applications. The conditioning, finishing and inspection facilities commenced operations in the third quarter 2008, and the forging equipment began operations in the third quarter 2009. Forging is a hot forming process that produces wrought forging billet and forged machining bar from an ingot. A new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility at our existing Brackenridge, PA site. The project is estimated to cost approximately $1.16 billion and take at least four years to complete. Engineering, permitting and site preparation are nearly completed for the facility. Our new advanced hot rolling and processing facility is designed to be the most powerful mill in the world for production of specialty metals. It is designed to produce exceptional quality, thinner, and wider hot rolled coils at reduced cost with shorter lead times, and require lower working capital requirements. When completed, we believe ATIs new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility will provide unsurpassed manufacturing capability and versatility in the production of a wide range of flat rolled specialty metals. We expect improved productivity, lower costs, and higher quality for our diversified product mix of flat rolled specialty metals, including nickel based and specialty alloys, titanium and titanium alloys, zirconium alloys, Precision Rolled Strip products, and stainless sheet and coiled plate products. It is designed to roll and process exceptional quality hot bands of up to 78.62 inches, or 2 meters, wide. In connection with the new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility, we are consolidating our Natrona, PA grain oriented electrical steel melt shop into ATIs Brackenridge, PA melt shop. This consolidation is expected to improve the overall productivity of ATIs flat rolled grain oriented electrical steel and other stainless and specialty alloys, and reduce the cost of producing slabs and ingots. The investment should also result in significant reduction of particulate emissions. We expect to realize considerable cost savings from this project beginning in second half of 2010. We are increasing our capacity to produce zirconium products through capital expansions of zirconium sponge production and VAR melting. This new zirconium sponge and melting capacity better positions ATI for the current and expected strong growth in demand from the nuclear energy and chemical process industry markets. We believe that ATI is now the worlds largest producer of critical reactor grade zirconium sponge for the nuclear energy market. Our STAL joint venture commenced an expansion of its operations in Shanghai, China in late 2006. This expansion nearly tripled STALs rolling and slitting capacity to produce Precision Rolled Strip products at a cost of approximately $103 million. The additional slitting capacity commenced operations in June 2009, and the remainder of the facility was completed in the second half of 2009. STAL is now much better positioned to benefit from Chinas electronics and telecommunications manufacturing market for cell phones and smartphones, as well as Chinas rapidly growing automotive parts manufacturing market. We believe STAL is the largest producer of these thin strip products in China and that our new facility gives us a significant competitive advantage in this growing market. On October 23, 2009, we acquired the assets of Crucible Compaction Metals and Crucible Research, a western Pennsylvania producer of advanced powder metal products, for approximately $39 million. This acquisition, which has been named ATI Powder Metals, expands our specialty metals product portfolio. Powder metals are used in the production of complex alloy chemistries, typically when conventional processes can not be used. Powder metals represent a growth opportunity for ATI as more powder metals are used in the aerospace industry for the latest generation of jet engines and for the production of near net shape parts. Additional markets for these powder metals products include oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical. We currently expect that our projected 2010 capital expenditures will be approximately $375 million, and we expect capital spending to remain in this range for the next few years as we complete these strategic projects. Debt Total debt outstanding increased by $561.3 million, to $1,071.1 million at December 31, 2009, from $509.8 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in debt was primarily due to new debt issuances, net of debt retirements, discussed below. Convertible Notes In June 2009, we issued and sold $402.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (the Convertible Notes). Interest is payable semi annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Net proceeds of $390.2 million from the sale of the Convertible Notes were used to make a $350 million voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes including funding of contributions to trusts established to fund retiree 36 Table of Contents medical benefits. The Convertible Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of its existing and future senior unsecured debt. The underwriting fees and other third party expenses for the issuance of the Convertible Notes were $12.3 million and will be amortized to interest expense over the 5 year term of the Convertible Notes. We do not have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to the stated maturity date. Holders of the Convertible Notes have the option to convert their notes into shares of ATI common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date (June 1, 2014). The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 23.9263 shares of ATI common stock per $1,000 (in whole dollars) principal amount of notes (9,630,336 shares), equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $41.795 per share, subject to adjustment, as defined in the Convertible Notes. Other than receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares, holders do not have the option to receive cash instead of shares of common stock upon conversion. Accrued and unpaid interest that exists upon conversion of a note will be deemed paid by the delivery of shares of ATI common stock and no cash payment or additional shares will be given to holders. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the Convertible Notes, holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Such a repurchase will be made in cash. 2019 Notes In June 2009, we issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 9.375% unsecured Senior Notes with a maturity of June 2019 (the 2019 Notes). Interest is payable semi annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Net proceeds of $344.2 million from the sale of the 2019 Notes were used to retire $183.3 million of the Companys 2011 Notes, as discussed below, and for general corporate purposes. The underwriting fees, discount and other third party expenses for the issuance of the 2019 Notes were $5.8 million and will be amortized to interest expense over the 10 year term of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of its existing and future senior unsecured debt. The 2019 Notes restrict our ability to create certain liens, to enter into sale leaseback transactions, and to consolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets. We have the option to redeem the 2019 Notes, as a whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice to the holders of the Notes at a redemption price specified in the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes are subject to repurchase upon the occurrence of a change in control repurchase event (as defined in the 2019 Notes) at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2019 Notes repurchased. Retirement of 2011 Notes In June 2009, we completed a tender offer for our 8.375% Notes due in 2011 (the 2011 Notes) of which $300 million in aggregate principal amount was outstanding prior to the tender offer. As a result of the tender offer, we retired $183.3 million of the 2011 Notes and recognized a pre tax charge of $9.2 million in the 2009 second quarter for the costs of acquiring the 2011 Notes. As of December 31, 2009, $116.7 million in face value of the 2011 Notes remain outstanding. Debt Ratios and Other In managing our overall capital structure, some of the measures on which we focus are net debt to total capitalization, which is the percentage of our debt, net of cash that may be available to reduce borrowings, to our total invested and borrowed capital, and total debt to total capitalization, which excludes cash balances. At year end 2009, our net debt to total capitalization was 15.3%, compared to 2.0% at December 31, 2008, and a negative 4.5% at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, our cash on hand exceeded our total debt. Total debt to total capitalization was 34.7% at December 31, 2009 compared to 20.7% at December 31, 2008, and 19.2% at December 31, 2007. 37 Table of Contents December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Total debt $ 1,071.1 $ 509.8 Less: Cash (708.8 ) (469.9 ) Net debt $ 362.3 $ 39.9 Net debt $ 362.3 $ 39.9 Total ATI stockholders equity 2,012.2 1,957.4 Net ATI capital $ 2,374.5 $ 1,997.3 Net debt to ATI capital 15.3 % 2.0 % December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Total debt $ 1,071.1 $ 509.8 Total ATI stockholders equity 2,012.2 1,957.4 Total ATI capital $ 3,083.3 $ 2,467.2 Total debt to ATI capital 34.7 % 20.7 % In May 2009, we amended our $400 million senior unsecured domestic bank group credit agreement which extends through July 31, 2012 to redefine the two financial covenants to provide additional financial flexibility. The amendment restated the definition of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes, and consolidated earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization as used in the interest coverage and leverage ratios to exclude any non cash pension expense or income and restates the definition of consolidated indebtedness used in the leverage ratio, which previously was based on gross indebtedness, to be net of cash on hand in excess of $50 million. As of December 31, 2009, there had been no borrowings made under the facility, although approximately $10 million of the facility was used to support letters of credit. The unsecured facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization) of not greater than 3.25, and maintain an interest coverage ratio (consolidated earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest expense) of not less than 2.0. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, our leverage ratio was 1.47, and our interest coverage ratio was 7.91. The Company has an additional separate credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2009, $29 million in letters of credit were outstanding under this facility. STAL, our Chinese joint venture company in which ATI has a 60% interest, has a revolving credit facility with a group of banks which extends though early August 2012. Under the credit facility, STAL may borrow up to 205 million renminbi (approximately $30 million at December 2009 exchange rates) at an interest rate equal to 90% of the applicable lending rate published by the Peoples Bank of China. The credit facility is supported solely by STALs financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners, and is intended to be utilized in the future for the expansion of STALs operations, which are located in Shanghai, China. The credit facility requires STAL to maintain a minimum level of shareholders equity, and certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2009, there had been no borrowings made under this credit facility. STAL had approximately $4 million in letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2009. These letters of credit are supported solely by STALs financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners. Interest rate swap contracts have been used from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. At December 31, 2009, we have no interest rate swap contracts in place. We have deferred gains on settled receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts associated with our outstanding 2011 Notes. These gains on settlement, which occurred in 2004 and 2003, remain a component of the reported balance of the 2011 Notes, and are ratably recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes, which is approximately two years. At December 31, 2009, the deferred settlement gain was $1.8 million. The result of the receive fixed, pay floating arrangements was a decrease in interest expense of $1.3 million, $2.0 million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, compared to the fixed interest expense of the 2011 Notes.

(B) We have contracted for physical delivery for certain of our raw materials to meet a portion of our needs. These contracts are based upon fixed or variable price provisions. We used current market prices as of December 31, 2009, for raw material obligations with variable pricing. (C) We have various contractual obligations that extend through 2015 for services involving production facilities and administrative operations. Our purchase obligation as disclosed represents the estimated termination fees payable if we were to exit these contracts. (D) Drawn amounts were $26.3 million at December 31, 2009 under foreign credit agreements, and drawn amounts are included in total debt. Drawn amounts also include $10.3 million utilized under the $400 million domestic senior unsecured credit facility for standby letters of credit, which renew annually, and $28.8 million under a separate letter of credit facility. These letters of credit are used to support: $30.0 million in workers compensation and general insurance arrangements, and $9.1 million related to environmental, legal and other matters. Retirement Benefits At December 31, 2009, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was essentially fully funded. The value of the liabilities of the qualified defined benefit pension plan exceeded pension plan investments as of the end of 2009, by $9 million, or approximately 0.4%. We have not been required to make cash contributions to this defined benefit pension plan since 1995. However, during the past six years, we have made $765.2 million in voluntary cash and stock contributions to this plan to improve the plans funded position. These voluntary contributions were comprised of cash contributions of $350 million in 2009, $30 million in 2008, and $100 million during each of 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, plus $50 million during 2004. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2008, we contributed 1.5 million shares of ATI common stock, valued at $35.2 million, to the pension plan. Based on current regulations and actuarial studies, we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2010. However, we may elect, depending upon investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. We fund certain retiree health care benefits for Allegheny Ludlum using investments held in a Company administered Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) trust. This allows us to recover a portion of the retiree medical costs. In accordance with our labor agreements, during 2009, 2008, and 2007, we funded $13.8 million, $34.3 million, and $30.8 million, respectively, of retiree medical costs using the investments of this VEBA trust. We may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the investments held in this VEBA. The value of the investments held in this VEBA was approximately $17 million as of December 31, 2009. Dividends We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock for each quarter of 2009 and 2008. The payment of dividends and the amount of such dividends depends upon matters deemed relevant by our Board of Directors, such as our results of operations, 39 Table of Contents financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by law, credit agreements or senior securities, and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate. Critical Accounting Policies The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality. Inventories At December 31, 2009, we had net inventory of $825.5 million. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last in, first out (LIFO), first in, first out (FIFO) and average cost methods) or market, less progress payments. Costs include direct material, direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs. Most of our inventory is valued utilizing the LIFO costing methodology. Inventory of our non U.S. operations is valued using average cost or FIFO methods. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have been extremely volatile during the past four years. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results, while, conversely, a fall in material costs results in a benefit to operating results. For example, in 2009, 2008 and 2007, the effect of falling raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $102.8 million, $169.0 million and $92.1 million, respectively, lower than would have been recognized had we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. However, in 2006 the effect of increases in raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $197.0 million higher than would have been recognized if we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. In a period of rising prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Conversely, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. The LIFO inventory valuation methodology is not utilized by many of the companies with which we compete, including foreign competitors. As such, our results of operations may not be comparable to those of our competitors during periods of volatile material costs due, in part, to the differences between the LIFO inventory valuation method and other acceptable inventory valuation methods. We evaluate product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value. The calculation of a resulting reserve, if any, is recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified. At December 31, 2009, no significant reserves were required. It is our general policy to write down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months. In some instances this criterion is up to twenty four months due to the longer manufacturing and distribution process for such products. Asset Impairment We monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets. An impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an assets use (including any proceeds from disposition) are less than the assets carrying value, and the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Changes in the expected use of a long lived asset group, and the financial performance of the long lived asset group and its operating segment, are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment. Future cash flow value may include appraisals for property, plant and equipment, land and improvements, future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets, and other operating considerations. There were no significant charges for impairment of long lived assets in the periods presented. Retirement Benefits We have defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all of our employees. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, benefit expenses recognized in financial statements for defined benefit pension plans are determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. A significant element in determining our pension (expense) income in accordance with the accounting standards is the expected investment return on plan assets. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration input from our third party pension plan asset managers and actuaries regarding the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. Our expected long term return on pension plan investments has been 8.75% for each of the past five years. We apply this assumed rate to the market value of plan assets 40 Table of Contents at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension (expense) income for the current year. The actual return on pension plan assets for 2009 was 16.4%. For 2008, actual investment results were a negative 25.3%, reversing a trend of positive returns of 10.9% for 2007, 18.2% for 2006, 9.7% for 2005, and 11.7% for 2004. Based upon our strategic allocation of pension assets across the various investments asset classes, our expected long term return on pension plan investments for 2010 remains at 8.75%. The effect of increasing, or lowering, the expected return on pension plan investments by 0.25% results in additional pretax annual income, or expense, of approximately $5.4 million. The cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods. The amount of expected return on plan assets can vary significantly from year to year since the calculation is dependent on the market value of plan assets as of the end of the preceding year. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to calculate the expected return on pension assets using either an average of fair market values of pension assets over a period not to exceed five years, which reduces the volatility in reported pension income or expense, or their fair market value at the end of the previous year. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission currently does not permit companies to change from the fair market value at the end of the previous year methodology, which is the methodology that we use, to an averaging of fair market values of plan assets methodology. As a result, our results of operations and those of other companies, including companies with which we compete, may not be comparable due to these different methodologies in calculating the expected return on pension investments. In accordance with accounting standards, we determine the discount rate used to value pension plan liabilities as of the last day of each year. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. In estimating this rate, we receive input from our actuaries regarding the rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments with maturities matched to the expected future retirement benefit payments. Based on this assessment at the end of December 2009, we established a discount rate of 6.2% for valuing the pension liabilities as of the end of 2009, and for determining the pension expense for 2010. We had previously assumed a discount rate of 6.85% at the end of 2008 and 6.25% for the end of 2007. The estimated effect of changing the discount rate by 0.50%, would decrease pension liabilities in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase pension liabilities in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $100 million. Such a change in the discount rate would decrease pension expense in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase pension expense in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $8 million. The effect on pension liabilities for changes to the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, are deferred and amortized over future periods in accordance with the accounting standards. As discussed above, gains and losses due to differences between actual and expected results for investment returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to value benefit obligations are deferred and recognized in the income statement over future periods. However for balance sheet presentation, these gains and losses are included in the determination of benefit obligations, net of plan assets, included on the year end statement of financial position. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $996 million of losses, primarily related to negative investment returns on plan assets in 2008, which have been recognized on the 2009 year end balance sheet through a reduction in stockholders equity which will be recognized in the income statement through expense amortizations over future years. We also sponsor several postretirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees and retirees. These plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Under most of the plans, our contributions towards premiums are capped based upon the cost as of certain dates, thereby creating a defined contribution. For the non collectively bargained plans, we maintain the right to amend or terminate the plans in the future. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting standards, postretirement expenses recognized in financial statements associated with defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as benefits are paid. We use actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for these plans. The discount rate, which is determined annually at the end of each year, is developed based upon rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. At the end of 2009, we determined the rate to be 6.2%, compared to a 6.85% discount rate in 2008, and a 6.25% discount rate in 2007. The estimated effect of changing the discount rate by 0.50%, would decrease postretirement obligations in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase postretirement obligations in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $17 million. Such a change in the discount rate would decrease postretirement benefit expense in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase postretirement benefit expense in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $0.5 million. Based upon predictions of continued significant medical cost inflation in future years, the annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits of health care plans is 9.92% in 2010 and is assumed to gradually decrease to 5.0% in the year 2028 and remain level thereafter. Certain of these postretirement benefits are funded using plan investments held in a Company administered VEBA trust. The expected return on plan investments is a significant element in determining postretirement benefits expenses in accordance with accounting standards. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. For 2009, our expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 8.3%. This assumed long term rate of return on investments is applied to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan investments that is included in annual postretirement benefits expenses for the current year. The actual return on investments held in the VEBA trust was a negative 15.9% in 2009 and a negative 9.5% in 2008 41 Table of Contents due primarily to losses on private equity investments. These investments losses during the past two years reversed a trend of positive returns of 16.9% in 2007, 50.0% in 2006, and 11.6% in both 2005 and 2004. Our expected return on investments in the VEBA trust is 8.3% for 2010. The expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust is expected to be lower than the return on pension plan investments due to the mix of assets held by the VEBA trust and the expected reduction of VEBA trust assets due to benefit payments. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted As required, in the first quarter 2009, we adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to consolidation accounting and reporting. These changes, among others, required that noncontrolling interests, formerly termed minority interests, be considered a component of equity for all periods presented. Noncontrolling interests were previously classified within other long term liabilities. In addition, the practice of reporting minority interest expense or benefit changed. The income statement presentation has been revised to separately present consolidated net income, which now includes the amounts attributable to ATI plus noncontrolling interests (minority interests), and net income attributable solely to ATI, for all periods presented. Absent a change in control, increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership interest amount are accounted for as equity transactions. As a result of adopting this accounting change, the balance sheet and the income statement have been recast retrospectively for the presentation of noncontrolling interest in our STAL joint venture. On January 1, 2009, we adopted changes issued by the FASB for fair value measurements as they relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. These changes define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. The fair value changes apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. The adoption of this change, as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, had no impact on the financial statements. The provisions will be applied at such time a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset or nonfinancial liability is required, which may result in a fair value that is materially different than would have been calculated prior to the adoption of these changes in the definition and measurement of fair value. Forward Looking Statements From time to time, the Company has made and may continue to make forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements in this report relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, would, should, will, will likely result, forecast, outlook, projects, and similar expressions. Such forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which the Company is unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results or performance to materially differ from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such statements. Various of these factors are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and will be described from time to time in the Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Companys Annual Reports on Form 10 K and the Companys subsequent reports filed with the SEC on Form 10 Q and Form 8 K, which are available on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov and on the Companys website at http://www.atimetals.com. We assume no duty to update our forward looking statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As part of our risk management strategy, we utilize derivative financial instruments, from time to time, to hedge our exposure to changes in raw material prices, foreign currencies, and interest rates. We monitor the third party financial institutions which are our counterparty to these financial instruments on a daily basis and diversify our transactions among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Fair values for derivatives were measured using exchange traded prices for the hedged items including consideration of counterparty risk and the Companys credit risk. Interest Rate Risk. We attempt to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately $42 million of floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.5%. Approximately $20 million of this floating rate debt is capped at a 6% maximum interest rate. Since the interest rate on floating rate debt changes with the short term market rate of interest, we are exposed to the risk that these interest rates may increase, raising our interest expense in situations where the interest rate is not capped. For example, a hypothetical 1% increase in the rate of interest on the $22 million of our outstanding floating rate debt not subjected to a cap would result in increased annual financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. Volatility of Energy Prices. Energy resources markets are subject to conditions that create uncertainty in the prices and availability of energy resources. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, have and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the 42 Table of Contents extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We use approximately 8 to 10 million MMBtus of natural gas annually, depending upon business conditions, in the manufacture of our products. These purchases of natural gas expose us to risk of higher gas prices. For example, a hypothetical $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of approximately $8 to $10 million. We use several approaches to minimize any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations from volatile energy prices. These approaches include incorporating an energy surcharge on many of our products and using financial derivatives to reduce exposure to energy price volatility. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding financial derivatives used to hedge our exposure to natural gas cost volatility represented approximately 50% of our forecasted requirements through 2011. The net mark to market valuation of these outstanding hedges at December 31, 2009 was an unrealized pre tax loss of $17.1 million, of which $10.2 million was presented in accrued liabilities, $7.5 million was presented in other long term liabilities, $0.3 million was presented in other current assets, and $0.3 million was presented in other assets on the balance sheet. The effects of the hedging activity will be recognized in income over the designated hedge periods. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effects of natural gas hedging activity increased cost of sales by $15.1 million. Volatility of Raw Material Prices. We use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of increased raw material costs; however, competitive factors in the marketplace can limit our ability to institute such mechanisms, and there can be a delay between the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefit of such mechanisms. For example, in 2009 we used approximately 60 million pounds of nickel; therefore a hypothetical change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately $60 million. In addition, in 2009 we also used approximately 600 million pounds of ferrous scrap in the production of our flat rolled products and a hypothetical change of $0.01 per pound would result in increased costs of approximately $6 million. While we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations, such as for nickel, we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure. We believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts, but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials. The majority of our products are sold utilizing raw material surcharges and index mechanisms. However as of December 31, 2009, we had entered into financial hedging arrangements primarily at the request of our customers related to firm orders, for approximately 10% of our estimated total annual nickel requirements in 2010. A minor amount of nickel hedges extend into 2012. Any gain or loss associated with these hedging arrangements is included in the cost of sales. At December 31, 2009, the net mark to market valuation of our outstanding raw material hedges was an unrealized pre tax gain of $15.4 million, comprised of $14.9 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $0.5 million in other long term assets on the balance sheet. Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used, from time to time, to limit transactional exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We sometimes purchase foreign currency forward contracts that permit us to sell specified amounts of foreign currencies expected to be received from our export sales for pre established U.S. dollar amounts at specified dates. The forward contracts are denominated in the same foreign currencies in which export sales are denominated. These contracts are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows of a portion of the forecasted future export sales transactions which otherwise would expose the Company to foreign currency risk. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding financial derivatives used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency, primarily euros, represented approximately 5% of our forecasted total international sales through 2011. At December 31, 2009, the net mark to market valuation of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was an unrealized pre tax gain of $7.4 million, of which $3.8 million is included in other current assets and $3.6 million in other long term assets on the balance sheet. In addition, we may also designate cash balances held in foreign currencies as hedges of forecasted foreign currency transactions. 43 Table of Contents
