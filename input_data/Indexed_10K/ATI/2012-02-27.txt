Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Risks Associated With Our Business Cyclical Demand for Products. The cyclical nature of the industries in which our customers operate causes demand for our products to be cyclical, creating potential uncertainty regarding future profitability. Various changes in general economic conditions may affect the industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers products due to economic downturns. Other factors that may cause fluctuation in our customers positions are changes in market demand, lower overall pricing due to domestic and international overcapacity, currency fluctuations, lower priced imports and increases in use or decreases in prices of substitute materials. As a result of these factors, our profitability has been and may in the future be subject to significant fluctuation. Worldwide economic conditions deteriorated significantly in the recent past and could remain weak in the future. These conditions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on demand for our customers products and, in turn, on demand for our products. If these conditions persist or worsen, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Product Pricing. From time to time, reduced demand, intense competition and excess manufacturing capacity have resulted in reduced prices, excluding raw material surcharges, for many of our products. These factors have had and may have an adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. Although inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate, during most of the same period certain critical raw material costs, such as nickel, titanium sponge, chromium, and molybdenum and scrap containing iron, nickel, titanium, chromium, and molybdenum have been volatile and at historically high levels. While we have been able to mitigate some of the adverse impact of rising raw material costs through raw material surcharges or indices to customers, rapid increases in raw material costs may adversely affect our results of operations. We change prices on certain of our products from time to time. The ability to implement price increases is dependent on market conditions, economic factors, raw material costs and availability, competitive factors, operating costs and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. The benefits of any price increases may be delayed due to long manufacturing lead times and the terms of existing contracts. Risks Associated with Commercial Aerospace. A significant portion of the sales of our High Performance Metals segment represents products sold to customers in the commercial aerospace industry. The commercial aerospace industry has historically been cyclical due to factors both external and internal to the airline industry. These factors include general economic conditions, airline profitability, consumer demand for air travel, varying fuel and labor costs, price competition, and international and domestic political conditions such as military conflict and the threat of terrorism. The length and degree of cyclical fluctuation are influenced by these factors and therefore are difficult to predict with certainty. Demand for our products in this segment is subject to these cyclical trends. A downturn in the commercial aerospace industry has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the prices at which we are able to sell these and other products, and our results of operations, business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 10 Table of Contents Risks Associated with Strategic Capital Projects. From time to time, we undertake strategic capital projects in order to enhance, expand and or upgrade our facilities and operational capabilities. For instance, over the past five years we have undertaken major expansions of our titanium and premium melt nickel based alloy, superalloy and specialty alloy production capabilities, and commenced construction of a new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility. Our ability to achieve the anticipated increased revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on these investments or other strategic capital projects that we may undertake is subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control, including a variety of market, operational, permitting, and labor related factors. In addition, the cost to implement any given strategic capital project ultimately may prove to be greater than originally anticipated. If we are not able to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of any of our strategic capital projects, or if we incur unanticipated implementation costs, our results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected. Dependence on Critical Raw Materials Subject to Price and Availability Fluctuations. We rely to a substantial extent on third parties to supply certain raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products. Purchase prices and availability of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility. At any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials on a timely basis, on price and other terms acceptable, or at all. If suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to customers and accepted customer orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, or have existing contracts, we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. The manufacture of some of our products is a complex process and requires long lead times. As a result, we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials. If unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions, or suffer harm to our reputation. We acquire certain important raw materials that we use to produce specialty materials, including nickel, chromium, cobalt, and titanium sponge, from foreign sources. Some of these sources operate in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions. These conditions may disrupt supplies or affect the prices of these materials. Volatility of Raw Material Costs. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have been extremely volatile. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in, first out (LIFO) inventory costing methodology, a rapid rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. For example in 2010, the increase in raw material costs on the LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which was $60.2 million higher than would have been recognized if we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. Conversely, in 2011, the decrease in raw material costs on the LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $9.3 million lower than would have been recognized if we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. In a period of rising raw material prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. However, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Availability of Energy Resources. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the supply of energy resources could temporarily impair the ability to manufacture products for customers. Further, increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, has and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Associated with Environmental Matters. We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants, and disposal of wastes, and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. We could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party sites. We also could be subject to future laws and regulations that govern greenhouse gas emissions and various matters related to climate change, which could increase our operating costs. 11 Table of Contents With respect to proceedings brought under the federal Superfund laws, or similar state statutes, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at approximately 36 of such sites, excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability. Our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately 27 of these sites, and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining 9 individual sites is not considered to be material. We are a party to various cost sharing arrangements with other PRPs at the sites. The terms of the cost sharing arrangements are subject to non disclosure agreements as confidential information. Nevertheless, the cost sharing arrangements generally require all PRPs to post financial assurance of the performance of the obligations or to pre pay into an escrow or trust account their share of anticipated site related costs. In addition, the Federal government, through various agencies, is a party to several such arrangements. We believe that we operate our businesses in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, from time to time, we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings involving alleged violations of, or liabilities arising from environmental laws. When our liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate our costs, we record environmental liabilities in our financial statements. In many cases, we are not able to determine whether we are liable, or if liability is probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. Estimates of our liability remain subject to additional uncertainties, including the nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the participation number and financial condition of other PRPs, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation. We intend to adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments. At December 31, 2011, our reserves for environmental matters totaled approximately $15 million. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the sites with which we are currently associated (either individually or in the aggregate) will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters, however, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Risks Associated with Current or Future Litigation and Claims. A number of lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our currently and formerly owned businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, commercial, government contracting work, employment, employee and retiree benefits, taxes, environmental, health and safety and occupational disease, and stockholder matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to us, we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period. Also, we can give no assurance that any other matters brought in the future will not have a material effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Labor Matters. We have approximately 11,400 full time employees, of which approximately 15% are located outside the United States. Approximately 47% of our workforce is covered by various collective bargaining agreements, principally with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (USW). During 2011, we finalized new collective bargaining agreements with USW represented production, office and maintenance employees at our Allegheny Ludlum operations in the Flat Rolled Products segment that extend through June 30, 2015. We also finalized new six year collective bargaining agreements for represented employees at ATI Ladish Forging, which will take effect as the current agreement with each bargaining unit expires, and extend to either 2018 or 2019, as applicable. Generally, collective bargaining agreements that expire may be terminated after notice by the union. After termination, the union may authorize a strike. A strike by the employees covered by one or more of the collective bargaining agreements could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the unions to replace those that expire. Export Sales. We believe that export sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our future revenues. Risks associated with export sales include: political and economic instability, including weak conditions in the worlds economies; accounts receivable collection; export controls; changes in legal and regulatory requirements; policy changes affecting the markets for our products; changes in tax laws and tariffs; trade duties; and exchange rate fluctuations (which may affect sales to international customers and the value of profits earned on export sales when converted into dollars). Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our results for the period in which they occur. Risks Associated with Retirement Benefits. At December 31, 2011, our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan was approximately 84% funded and we are not required to make any contribution to this plan in 2012. However, we may be required to fund the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the years beyond 2012 depending upon the value of plan investments and obligations in the future and changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding. Depending on the timing and amount, a requirement that we fund our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents Risks Associated with Acquisition and Disposition Strategies. We intend to continue to strategically position our businesses in order to improve our ability to compete. Strategies we employ to accomplish this may include seeking new or expanding existing specialty market niches for our products, expanding our global presence, acquiring businesses complementary to existing strengths and continually evaluating the performance and strategic fit of our existing business units. From time to time, management holds discussions with management of other companies to explore acquisition, joint ventures, and other business combination opportunities as well as possible business unit dispositions. As a result, the relative makeup of the businesses comprising our Company is subject to change. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and other business combinations involve various inherent risks, such as: assessing accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition or other transaction candidates; the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business; our ability to achieve identified financial and operating synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction; and unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquisition or other transaction. International acquisitions and other transactions could be affected by export controls, exchange rate fluctuations, domestic and foreign political conditions and a deterioration in domestic and foreign economic conditions. Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Insurance. We have maintained various forms of insurance, including insurance covering claims related to our properties and risks associated with our operations. Our existing property and liability insurance coverages contain exclusions and limitations on coverage. From time to time, in connection with renewals of insurance, we have experienced additional exclusions and limitations on coverage, larger self insured retentions and deductibles and significantly higher premiums. As a result, in the future our insurance coverage may not cover claims to the extent that it has in the past and the costs that we incur to procure insurance may increase significantly, either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Political and Social Turmoil. The war on terrorism and recent political and social turmoil could put pressure on economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These political, social and economic conditions could make it difficult for us, our suppliers and our customers to forecast accurately and plan future business activities, and could adversely affect the financial condition of our suppliers and customers and affect customer decisions as to the amount and timing of purchases from us. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Risks Associated with Government Contracts. Some of our operating companies perform contractual work directly for the U.S. Government. Various claims (whether based on U.S. Government or Company audits and investigations or otherwise) could be asserted against us related to our U.S. Government contract work. Depending on the circumstances and the outcome, such proceedings could result in fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages or the cancellation or suspension of payments under one or more U.S. Government contracts. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or units, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts based on the results of investigations. Currently, there is no material portion of our business with the U.S. Government which might be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. Government.

Finishing of our flat rolled products takes place at our domestic facilities located in Brackenridge, Bagdad, Vandergrift, Midland and Washington, PA, and in Wallingford and Waterbury, CT, New Castle, IN, New Bedford, MA, and Louisville, OH. We are constructing a new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility for our Flat Rolled Products business segment at our existing Brackenridge, PA site. This investment, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2013, is designed to produce exceptional quality, thinner, and wider hot rolled coils at reduced cost with shorter lead times and require lower working capital requirements. 13 Table of Contents Our principal domestic facilities for the production of our engineered products are located in Nashville, TN, Huntsville, Grant and Gurley, AL, Houston, TX, and Waynesboro, PA (tungsten powder, tungsten carbide materials and carbide cutting tools and threading systems). Other domestic facilities in this segment are located in Portland, IN and Lebanon, KY (carbon alloy steel forgings); LaPorte, IN and Alpena, MI (grey and ductile iron castings), and southwestern Pennsylvania (precision metals finishing services). Substantially all of our properties are owned, and three of our properties are subject to mortgages or similar encumbrances securing borrowings under certain industrial development authority financings. We also own or lease facilities in a number of foreign countries, including France, Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Poland, and the Peoples Republic of China. We own and or lease and operate facilities for melting and re melting, machining and bar mill operations, laboratories and offices located in Sheffield, England. We own highly engineered forging and machining operations in Stalowa Wola, Poland. Through our STAL joint venture, we operate facilities for finishing Precision Rolled Strip products in the Xin Zhuang Industrial Zone, Shanghai, China. Our executive offices, located in PPG Place in Pittsburgh, PA, are leased. Although our facilities vary in terms of age and condition, we believe that they have been well maintained and are in sufficient condition for us to carry on our activities. Item 3. Legal Proceedings In December 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sent a subsidiary of the Company a notice of violation (NOV) alleging violations of rules governing the management of hazardous wastes at the entitys Albany, Oregon facility. In May 2010, the EPA sent a second NOV alleging additional violations of hazardous waste rules arising out of related circumstances, and a separate NOV to another subsidiary, which alleged violations of the hazardous waste rules at their Albany, Oregon facility. The Company and the EPA are discussing resolution of these NOVs. We become involved from time to time in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings relating to the conduct of our current and formerly owned businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, commercial, employment, employee and retiree benefits, taxes, environmental, health and safety and occupational disease, and stockholder matters. While we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit, claim or proceeding, our management believes that the disposition of any pending matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. The resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters, including those described above, however, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period. Information relating to legal proceedings is included in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and incorporated herein by reference. Item 4.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements. Actual results or performance could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described below. Net income and net income per share amounts referenced below are attributable to Allegheny Technologies Incorporated. Overview of 2011 Financial Performance Results for 2011 reflect our continued growth in key global markets through strategic investments, from both internal expansion and acquisitions. We acquired Ladish Co., Inc. (now ATI Ladish) in May 2011, which added advanced forgings, titanium investment castings and precision finishing capabilities to ATIs product portfolio within our High Performance Metals business segment. Net income attributable to ATI for the full year 2011 increased to $214.3 million, or $1.97 per share, compared to $70.7 million, or $0.72 per share, for 2010. Results for 2011 included $29.6 million, net of tax, for Ladish acquisition expenses and other charges. Sales in 2011 increased 28% to $5.18 billion compared to $4.05 billion for 2010. Direct international sales for 2011 increased $530.5 million and represented 35% of our total sales. For 2011, the Flat Rolled Products segment generated 51%, the High Performance Metals segment generated 43%, and the Engineered Products segment generated 6% of our direct international sales. Our 2011 results reflect ATIs position as a globally focused, diversified high value specialty metals company with strong cash flow and liquidity, and a solid balance sheet. The aerospace and defense market and the global infrastructure markets, specifically oil and gas, chemical process industry, electrical energy, and the medical market, have been driving our performance for the last several years, and represented 70% of ATIs 2011 sales. For 2011, sales to the aerospace and defense market grew 44% and represented 29% of our sales, as the acquisition of ATI Ladish augmented organic growth. Sales in 2011 to the oil and gas and chemical process industry markets grew 41%, representing 21% of ATI sales. Our 2011 sales to our other key growth markets also increased, with 16% growth to the electrical energy market, representing 15% of ATI sales, and 8% growth to the medical market, representing 5% of ATI sales. 18 Table of Contents In our High Performance Metals segment, sales in 2011 increased 46% to $1.96 billion, due to ATI Ladish sales and improved overall demand from the commercial aerospace jet engine market, both for new aircraft builds and replacement spares as a result of increased flight activity. Sales to the electrical energy market increased 86%, driven by demand for land based natural gas turbines. In addition, demand increased from the oil and gas market, reflecting the trend toward directional drilling, deep water projects and sour gas projects, and in the medical market for implants and imaging equipment. Demand was lower for our materials from the chemical processing market due to project specific activity. Operating profit for the High Performance Metals segment was $364.5 million, or 18.6% of sales, a 41% increase compared to 2010, due primarily to higher shipments for most of our products, a favorable product mix, improved selling prices and the benefits from our gross cost reductions. Operating profit was impacted by inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Ladish transaction of $27.3 million, and start up and idle facility costs of $31.7 million associated with our primary titanium sponge operations. The start up costs relate mostly to our Rowley, UT premium titanium sponge facility. The facility remains on track to complete the standard grade qualification by the end of the 2012 first quarter. With stable raw material input costs, higher production rates, and improved plant efficiencies, we expect to produce more titanium sponge at lower costs in 2012, compared to 2011. Idle facility costs relate mostly to our Albany, OR titanium sponge facility, which is positioned to be back in production when warranted by market conditions. In our Flat Rolled Products segment, sales increased 17% to $2.73 billion primarily as a result of increased high value product shipments to the oil and gas, chemical process industry and aerospace markets. Total product shipments decreased 1% for the full year 2011, as shipments of high value products increased 9% while shipments of standard stainless products declined 9%. Volatile raw material costs and the resulting impact on surcharges affected customer buying behavior during the second half of the year as they managed inventory levels and the timing of purchases. Operating profit for the Flat Rolled Products segment increased to $213.4 million, a 148% increase compared to 2010. The improvement in 2011 operating profit was due primarily to higher shipments of high value products, a better matching of raw material prices with surcharges, and the benefits from our gross cost reduction efforts. Operating results for 2011 included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $34.7 million, compared to a $70.7 million LIFO inventory valuation charge in 2010. In our Engineered Products segment, 2011 sales increased 35% to $501.1 million, primarily due to increased demand from all the major markets for our products: oil and gas, transportation, construction and mining, and cutting tools. The significant sales increase resulted in an operating profit of $34.1 million for 2011, a 166% increase compared to 2010. For 2011, total segment operating profit increased 72% to $612.0 million compared to $356.5 million for 2010. During 2011, we strengthened our positions in key global growth markets, continued to enhance our manufacturing capabilities, reduced costs, and maintained our strong balance sheet. We also realized continued success in implementing the ATI Business System, which is continuing to drive lean manufacturing throughout our operations. Our accomplishments during 2011 from these important efforts included: Continued growth in our global market presence as direct international sales increased $530.3 million to represent 35% of total sales. We believe at least 50% of ATIs 2011 sales were driven by global markets when we consider exports by our customers. Continued improvement in our positions with key customers in the aerospace, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical markets as we entered into new long term agreements for our Mission Critical Metallics&reg;, to reduce their supply uncertainty. In June 2011, we announced a long term sourcing agreement through 2024 with Rolls Royce plc for the supply of ATI 718 Plus&reg; alloy, a nickel based superalloy that is used in static and rotating jet engine applications. In October 2011, we announced the extension of our titanium products supply agreement with The Boeing Company through the end of 2018. The extension agreement covers value added titanium mill products and provides opportunity for greater use of ATIs highly engineered titanium cast and forged products. Continued expansion of our industry leading technology portfolio by making important research and development investments. ATI 718 Plus&reg; alloy, our groundbreaking nickel based superalloy, continued to gain acceptance in the marketplace and is being used on legacy and next generation engines. We also continued our commercial developments of ATI 425&reg; alloy, an innovative new cold rollable titanium alloy that is now qualified for aerospace applications, and can be used for armor and defense applications where light weight, strength and formability are critical. These products are aimed at enabling customers to manufacture near net shapes more quickly and at reduced costs. We continued to realize significant benefits from our strategic focus on key high value specialty products, including titanium and titanium alloys, precision castings and forgings, nickel based alloys and specialty alloys, exotic alloys, and grain oriented electrical steel. In 2011, sales of these key high value products represented 78% of our total sales. 19 Table of Contents We continued to build a foundation for profitable growth. We significantly increased strategic capital investments in our businesses to support the expected long term growth in our markets, especially for titanium and titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys. Since 2004, we have transformed ATI by investing over $3.3 billion in capital expenditures and acquisitions, of which $1.2 billion was spent in 2011, to support this growth. Virtually all of these investments have been in the United States, and more than 75% has been self funded. Significant among these investments are: The acquisition of Ladish Co., Inc. (Ladish) on May 9, 2011 for $897.6 million through the issuance of 7.3 million shares of ATI common stock and payment of $384 million in cash ($349 million net of cash acquired). ATI Ladish results are included in the High Performance Metals segment from the date of the acquisition. Based in Wisconsin, ATI Ladish engineers, produces and markets high strength, high technology forged and cast metal components for a wide variety of load bearing and fatigue resisting applications in the jet engine, aerospace and industrial markets, for both domestic and international customers. Ladish sales in 2010 were $403.1 million. As a result of the acquisition, ATI is now a fully integrated supplier, from raw material (for titanium) and melt through highly engineered technically complex parts, creating a more integrated, stable and sustainable supply chain for aerospace, defense and industrial markets. The expansion of ATIs aerospace quality titanium sponge production capabilities. Titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products. Our greenfield premium grade titanium sponge (jet engine rotating parts) facility in Rowley, UT, with a total cost of approximately $500 million, continued to ramp up production during 2011, and we expect to complete the standard grade qualification process by the end of the first quarter 2012, to be followed by premium grade qualification. When this Utah sponge facility is fully operational, our total annual sponge production capacity, including our Albany, OR standard grade titanium sponge facility, is projected to be approximately 46 million pounds. These secure supply sources are intended to reduce our purchased titanium sponge and purchased titanium scrap requirements. In addition, the Utah facility will have the infrastructure in place to further expand annual capacity by approximately 18 million pounds, bringing the total annual capacity at that facility to 42 million pounds, if needed. The expansion of our High Performance Metals segment production capabilities in North Carolina. Our fourth cold hearth plasma arc melt furnace for melting premium titanium alloys is in the qualification stage and is expected to support our growth in demand for high value products in 2012. Our titanium alloys and nickel based alloys and superalloys forging facility, which was constructed in phases through 2009 and is now fully in service, includes a new 10,000 ton press forge and a new 700mm radial forge, both of which we believe are the largest of their kind in the world for producing these types of alloys. The facility also includes billet conditioning and finishing equipment. The design and construction of a new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility at our existing Flat Rolled Products segment Brackenridge, PA site for approximately $1.1 billion. The facility construction is progressing on schedule, with construction expected to be completed by the end of 2013 and commissioning occurring in the first half of 2014. The new hot rolling and processing facility is designed to be the most powerful mill in the world for production of specialty metals. It is designed to produce exceptional quality, thinner, and wider hot rolled coils at reduced cost with shorter lead times, and require lower working capital requirements. When completed, we believe ATIs new hot rolling and processing facility will provide unsurpassed manufacturing capability and versatility in the production of a wide range of flat rolled specialty metals. We expect improved productivity, lower costs, and higher quality for our diversified product mix of flat rolled specialty metals, including nickel based and specialty alloys, titanium and titanium alloys, zirconium alloys, Precision Rolled Strip &reg; products, and stainless sheet and coiled plate products. It is designed to roll and process exceptional quality hot bands of up to 78.62 inches, or 2 meters, wide. We currently plan to spend approximately $485 million for capital expenditures in 2012, all of which we expect to fund from operating cash flow and available funds on hand, and we expect capital spending to remain at this level for each of the next few years while we complete our strategic capital projects. We realized significant cash generation in 2011, with cash flow from operations of $297 million, which included investing $273 million in managed working capital to meet the needs of a significant increase in business activity. We invested $625 million in 2011, including $349 million for the Ladish acquisition and $278 million in capital expenditures. We continued to maintain our strong balance sheet. In January 2011, we sold $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.95% Senior Notes due 2021, and realized net proceeds of $495 million. We used these proceeds primarily to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration for Ladish. During 2011, we retired $147 million of debt, including the remaining $117 million of 8.375% Notes which matured in December 2011, and we made dividend payments to ATI stockholders of $75 million. Cash on hand at the end of 2011 was $381 million, a $52 million decrease from year end 2010. At the end of 2011, our percentages of net debt to total capitalization and total debt to total capital were 31.3% and 37.9%, respectively. Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan was approximately 84% funded, and we are not required to make any contributions to this plan for 2012. 20 Table of Contents Our safety focus continued across all of ATIs operations. Our OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate was 2.61 and our Lost Time Case Rate was 0.47 per 200,000 hours worked. ATI Allegheny Ludlum facilities recently completed a streak of over 13 million hours worked without a Lost Time accident. We realized continued success from the ATI Business System, which continues to drive lean manufacturing throughout our operations. In addition to the safety performance discussed above, we realized over $123 million in gross cost reductions in 2011, which exceeded our goal of $100 million. We have targeted additional gross cost reductions of at least $100 million in 2012. Our focus is to continue to deliver value for our customers and profitable growth for our stockholders. Our outlook for the commercial aerospace market remains bullish. We expect to benefit from increased build rates for legacy and next generation aircraft and engines, and increased demand for aftermarket jet engine spare parts, as well as from development work on future generation jet engines. Demand for our products generally leads a change to a production build schedule by approximately 6 to 12 months. We expect demand from the global oil and gas and chemical process industries to remain strong. ATI benefits from the trend toward horizontal and directional drilling, deep water projects, and sour gas projects. In the chemical processing industry, ATI benefits from projects requiring specialty metals that can withstand highly corrosive and hot environments. In the electrical energy market, we expect to benefit from growing global demand for safe, clean and efficient electrical energy. Our specialty metals are used in nuclear, coal, and natural gas power generation, including pollution control equipment and spent nuclear fuel storage. Demand for our products is growing from renewables, particularly solar and geothermal power. Demand for our products from the medical market is expected to remain strong because of the aging populations in developed countries and the growth of advanced medical procedures in developing countries requiring the products that we produce. We also expect to benefit from our ongoing market and product development activities aimed at introducing innovative new ATI alloys and extending our reach into our key global markets with product forms that are new to ATI. We intend to use these improving market conditions to continue to positively differentiate ATI as a uniquely positioned, diversified, technology driven global specialty metals producer. Results of Operations Sales were $5.18 billion in 2011, $4.05 billion in 2010, and $3.05 billion in 2009. Direct international sales represented approximately 35% of 2011 sales, 32% of 2010 sales, and 31% of 2009 sales. Segment operating profit was $612.0 million in 2011, $356.5 million in 2010, and $282.2 million in 2009. Our measure of segment operating profit, which we use to analyze the performance and results of our business segments, excludes income taxes, corporate expenses, net interest expense, retirement benefit expense, other costs net of gains on asset sales and restructuring costs, if any. We believe segment operating profit, as defined, provides an appropriate measure of controllable operating results at the business segment level. Income before tax was $339.4 million in 2011, $125.7 million in 2010, and $64.9 million in 2009. Net income attributable to ATI was $214.3 million in 2011, $70.7 million for 2010, and $31.7 million for 2009. Results for 2011 include after tax charges of $29.6 million, or $0.26 per share, for Ladish acquisition expenses, accelerated recognition of equity compensation due to executive retirements, and restructuring and start up expenses. Results in 2009 included after tax charges of $17.0 million, or $0.17 per share, related to second quarter 2009 actions to retire debt and the tax consequences of our $350 million voluntary pension contribution. We operate in three business segments: High Performance Metals, Flat Rolled Products and Engineered Products.

In 2011 and 2010, the aerospace market represented 59% and 58%, respectively, of the revenues of the segment with products for jet engines representing the majority of the sales. In addition, we have become a larger supplier of specialty metals used in airframe construction. In 2011 and 2010, sales of our material into the airframe market represented approximately 26% and 36%, respectively of our aerospace market sales. Over the past several years, we have entered into long term agreements with our customers for Mission Critical Metallics&reg; to reduce their supply uncertainty. During 2011, we extended our titanium products supply agreement for aircraft airframes and structural components with The Boeing Company through the end of 2018. The extension agreement covers value added titanium mill products and provides opportunity for greater use of ATIs highly engineered titanium cast and forged products. This long term agreement includes both long product forms which are manufactured within the High Performance Metals segment, and a significant amount of plate products which are manufactured utilizing assets of both the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products segments. Revenues and profits associated with these titanium products covered by the long term agreement are included primarily in the results for the High Performance Metals segment. In September 2009, we signed a ten year sourcing agreement with Rolls Royce plc for the supply of nickel based superalloy disc quality products for commercial jet engine applications with potential revenue estimated to be between $750 million and $1 billion. We also have a long term agreement with GE Aviation for the supply of premium titanium alloys, nickel based alloys, and vacuum melted specialty alloys products for commercial and military jet engine applications. The commercial aerospace markets use of titanium alloys is expected to increase significantly as new aircraft airframe designs use a larger percentage of titanium alloys. For example, the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner airframe (excluding engines) is expected to use significantly more titanium and titanium alloys as a percentage of total weight than any previous commercial aircraft airframe. New aircraft designs from Airbus, the A380 and A350 XWB, and from defense contractors are also expected to utilize a greater percentage of titanium alloys. Given the significant current backlogs of Boeing and Airbus, as well as the engine manufacturers, this increasing 23 Table of Contents demand for titanium alloys mill products is expected to last for at least the next several years. Production difficulties for new aircraft such as the Boeing 787, which experienced a production delay of approximately three years, along with decreased demand in the aeroengine aftermarket due to weakness in the global economy in late 2008 and through 2009, have resulted in excess availability of materials in the aerospace supply chain. This excess availability of material had an adverse effect on the demand and selling prices for certain of the materials we produce, especially titanium alloys and nickel based superalloys. This supply condition also resulted in the temporarily idling our Albany, OR titanium sponge facility at the end of July 2009 to adjust our titanium production and inventory levels to market demand. During 2010 and 2011, aerospace market conditions began to improve as Boeing and Airbus began to ramp up production of legacy single aisle aircraft, such as the 737 and A320, to meet the demand of increasing backlogs for these aircraft. Additionally, the Boeing 787 entered service in late 2011, and production and deliveries of this aircraft are increasing. Both Boeing and Airbus have implemented production increases, and announced future production increases over the next several years for legacy and next generation aircraft, which is expected to positively benefit the demand for titanium alloys and nickel based superalloys for both jet engine and airframe applications. Due to manufacturing cycle times, demand for our specialty metals leads the deliveries of new aircraft by between 6 to 12 months. In addition, as our specialty metals are used in rotating components of jet engines, demand for our products for spare parts is impacted by aircraft flight activity and engine refurbishment requirements of U.S. and foreign aviation regulatory authorities. As the number of aircraft in service increases, the need for our materials associated with engine refurbishment is expected to increase.

According to Airline Monitor, it is the falloff in deliveries of the old types, not the ramp up rate of new models, that we see being mostly responsible for the decline in deliveries. This forecast differs with recent announcements by the OEMs. Even with the Airline Monitor assumption, the forecasted deliveries in 2015 and 2016 remain near historically high levels. Based on Airline Monitor data, the share of large twin aisle aircraft builds will grow from 4% of commercial aircraft builds in 2011 to more than 20% in 2016. The projected growth increase of large twin aisle aircraft builds is significant as these next generation large aircraft utilize significantly more of the high value types of materials we produce in both the airframe and in the engines. Airline revenue passenger miles and freight miles increased 6.4% and 0.9%, respectively, in 2011 compared to 2010, continuing the growth trends of 8% and 19%, respectively, in 2010 compared to 2009, as business activity levels recovered from the global economic weakness experienced in 2008 2009. Since 2004, airline revenue passenger miles and freight miles have compound annual growth rates of 4.5% and 1.9%, respectively, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data. Based on July 2011 forecasts, the ICAO expects growth of at least 6% annually, for several years, based on the demand for passenger and freight travel from developing economies, especially in Asia and the Middle East, and expected continuing economic growth in the rest of the world. New commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries have increased 2.8% annually since 2005. Independent forecasts from both Airline Monitor and Forecast International project 2.2% compound growth of commercial and military jet aircraft deliveries for the next 5 years. 25 Table of Contents High Performance Metals segment operating profit for 2011 increased 41% to $364.5 million compared to 2010, due primarily to higher shipments for most of our products, a favorable product mix, improved selling prices and the benefits of gross cost reductions. Operating profit in 2011 was impacted by $27.3 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Ladish transaction, and $31.7 million of start up and idle facility costs associated with our primary titanium sponge operations. Operating profit in 2010 included $55.8 million of start up and idle facility costs mainly involving the primary titanium sponge operations. The start up costs relate mostly to our Rowley, UT premium titanium sponge facility. This facility remains on track to complete the standard grade qualification by the end of the 2012 first quarter. With stable raw material input costs, higher production rates, and improved plant efficiencies, we expect to produce more titanium sponge at lower costs in 2012, compared to 2011, with a continued decline of start up expenses for this facility of titanium and nickel based and specialty steel alloys, which were partially offset by lower average selling prices for most of our products, lower exotic alloys shipment volume, and $55.8 million for idle facility and start up costs, mainly involving the primary titanium sponge operations. Operating results for 2011 included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $6.6 million, compared to a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $16.3 million in 2010. We continued to aggressively reduce costs in 2011. Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled approximately $63 million. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $39 million from operating efficiencies and $18 million from procurement savings. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales for the High Performance Metals segment for 2010 increased 3% to $1.34 billion, due primarily to improved demand from the commercial aerospace jet engine market, as the supply chain adjusted to increasing aircraft production schedules and the aeroengine aftermarket improved as a result of increased flight activity. In addition, demand from the medical market for implants and imaging equipment increased by 36%. The improvement in these markets was partially offset by lower demand for our materials from the chemical processing and nuclear energy markets.

The improvement in 2011 operating profit was due primarily to higher shipments of high value products, a better matching of raw material prices with surcharges, and the benefits of our gross cost reduction efforts. Operating results for 2011 included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve benefit of $34.7 million, compared to a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $70.7 million in 2010. 29 Table of Contents We continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our flat rolled products operations. In 2011 we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $47 million in our Flat Rolled Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $25 million from operating efficiencies and $18 million from procurement savings. In the fourth quarter 2011, we implemented plans to consolidate certain finishing operations in the Flat Rolled Products segment, which resulted in $2.6 million of restructuring charges, primarily related to severance and benefit costs associated with the temporary idling of the New Castle, IN sheet finishing facility. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales for the Flat Rolled Products segment for 2010 were $2.34 billion, or 54% higher than 2009, due primarily to increased shipments, higher raw material surcharges, and improved base selling prices for stainless products.

Operating results were impacted by idle facility costs of $2.7 million for 2010. Results for 2010 included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $5.8 million due to higher raw material costs. In 2009, the operating loss included idle facility and workforce reduction costs of $5.7 million, and was partially offset by a LIFO benefit of $9.0 million primarily as a result of lower raw material costs. In 2010, we achieved gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, of approximately $20 million in our Engineered Products segment. Major areas of gross cost reductions included $13 million from procurement savings and operating efficiencies, and $7 million from lower compensation and benefit expenses. Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were $92.5 million in 2011 compared to $64.1 million in 2010, and $53.1 million in 2009. The increase in corporate expenses in 2011 was primarily the result of annual and long term performance based compensation expenses, including the accelerated recognition of equity compensation due to executive retirements. Additionally, the increase in corporate expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to Ladish acquisition expenses and higher corporate funded R&D costs. The increase in corporate expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to corporate funded R&D, Ladish acquisition expenses, and higher incentive based compensation expenses. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net of interest income and interest capitalization, was $92.3 million in 2011, $62.7 million for 2010 and $19.3 million for 2009. The increase in interest expense in 2011 was primarily due to the January 7, 2011 issuance of $500 million of 5.95% Notes due 2021, and debt assumed in the Ladish acquisition. The increase in interest expense in 2010 was due to lower capitalized interest on strategic projects as a result of project completions as well as the full year of interest costs associated with the debt issuances completed in the 2009 second quarter. Interest expense is presented net of interest income of $1.4 million for 2011, $1.1 million for 2010, and $2.1 million for 2009. Capital expenditures associated with strategic investments to expand our production capabilities resulted in interest capitalization in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Interest expense in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was reduced by $12.1 million, $12.5 million, and $39.0 million, respectively, related to interest capitalization on major strategic capital projects. In prior years, we entered into receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap contracts related to our $300 million, 8.375% 10 year Notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes), which were later settled, resulting in a gain. The settlement gain was amortized into income as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2011 Notes, which matured in December 2011. Interest expense decreased by $0.9 million in both 2011 and 2010, and $1.3 million in 2009 due to these previously settled interest rate swap agreements. In June 2009, we completed the issuance of $350 million of 9.375% 10 year Senior Notes and a tender offer for the 2011 Notes. As a result of the tender offer, in June 2009 we retired $183.3 million of the 2011 Notes, which resulted in a special charge for debt extinguishment of $9.2 million pre tax, or $5.5 million after tax, in the second quarter 2009. 32 Table of Contents Other Expenses, Net of Gains on Asset Sales Other expenses, net of gains on asset sales, includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations, pre tax gains and losses on the sale of surplus real estate, non strategic investments and other assets, and other non operating income or expense. These items are presented primarily in selling and administrative expenses, and in other income in the consolidated statements of income and resulted in net charges of $9.9 million in 2011, $13.9 million in 2010, and $13.8 million in 2009. Other expenses for 2011, 2010, and 2009 primarily related to legal costs associated with closed operations. Retirement Benefit Expense Retirement benefit expense, which includes pension and postretirement medical benefits, declined year over year in both 2011 and 2010. The decreases in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher than expected returns on pension plan assets and the benefits resulting from our voluntary pension contributions made over the past several years. Over the past seven years, we have made over $765 million of voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, including $350 million in the second quarter of 2009. Retirement benefit expense was $77.9 million in 2011, $90.1 million for 2010, and $121.9 million for 2009. Retirement benefit expenses are included in both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses. Retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses for the years ended 2011, 2010, and 2009 was as follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cost of sales $ 55.1 $ 64.6 $ 85.4 Selling and administrative expenses 22.8 25.5 36.5 Total retirement benefit expense $ 77.9 $ 90.1 $ 121.9 Total retirement benefit expense for 2012 is expected to increase to approximately $122 million, a $44 million increase from 2011. We expect pension expense to be approximately $98 million, an increase of $40.6 million compared to pension expense of $57.4 million in 2011. This expected increase is primarily a result of utilizing a lower discount rate to value the plans obligations and lower than expected returns on pension plan assets for 2011. Income Taxes Net income for 2011 included a provision for income taxes of $116.3 million, or 34.3% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The 2010 provision for income taxes was $47.0 million, or 37.4% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The 2010 provision for income taxes included a non recurring charge of $5.3 million related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Under this legislation, the tax advantage of the subsidy to encourage companies to provide retiree prescription drug coverage was eliminated. Although the elimination of this tax advantage under the new legislation does not take effect until 2013, the Company was required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to recognize the full accounting impact in the period in which the Act became law. Since future anticipated retiree health care liabilities and related tax subsidies were already reflected in ATIs financial statements, the change in law resulted in a reduction of the value of the Companys deferred tax asset related to the subsidy. Results of operations for 2010 also included a tax charge of $3.9 million primarily due to the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act, which allowed businesses of all sizes to accelerate depreciation on certain property placed into service during 2010, which increased the Companys ability to recover prior years cash taxes paid, but reduced the current year tax benefit of the manufacturing deduction. Net income for 2009 included a provision for income taxes of $26.9 million, or 41.4% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The 2009 provision for income taxes included a non recurring charge of $11.5 million recognized in the second quarter 2009 primarily associated with the tax consequences of the June 2009 $350 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. At December 31, 2011, we had a net deferred tax liability of $33.3 million. Financial Condition and Liquidity We believe that internally generated funds, current cash on hand, and available borrowings under our existing credit facilities will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs, including a substantial expansion of our production capabilities over the next few years. We did not borrow funds under our domestic senior unsecured credit facility during 2011, 2010, or 2009. However, as of December 31, 2011 approximately $7 million of this facility was utilized to support letters of credit. 33 Table of Contents If we needed to obtain additional financing using the credit markets, the cost and the terms and conditions of such borrowings may be influenced by our credit rating. Changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to, or the cost of, our existing credit facilities. We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S K. Cash Flow and Working Capital Cash flow from operations for 2011 was $296.8 million, as improved profitability was partially offset by an investment in managed working capital of $273.3 million, primarily due to a significant increase in the level of business activity. Cash used in investing activities was $624.7 million, including $349.2 million for the purchase of Ladish, net of cash acquired, and $278.2 in capital expenditures. Cash provided by financing activities was $276.2 million in 2011, primarily due to issuance of $500.0 million of 5.95% Senior notes, partially offset by debt retirements of $146.9 million, including the remaining $117 million of 8.375% Notes which matured in December 2011, and dividend payments to ATI stockholders of $74.7 million. At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents on hand totaled $380.6 million, a decrease of $51.7 million from year end 2010. Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was $116.0 million at December 31, 2011. Cash flow from operations for 2010 was $27.1 million, as an investment in managed working capital of $318.5 million to support increased business activity and higher raw material costs offset improved profitability. During 2010, we invested $219.1 in capital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities was $86.8 million in 2010, primarily due to dividend payments of $70.8 million. At December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents on hand totaled $432.3 million, a decrease of $276.5 million from year end 2009. Managed Working Capital As part of managing the liquidity of the business, we focus on controlling inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. In measuring performance in controlling this managed working capital, we exclude the effects of LIFO inventory valuation reserves, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which, due to their nature, are managed separately. We also measure managed working capital as a percentage of the prior two months annualized sales to evaluate our performance based on recent levels of business volume. 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 Millions/$ 576 853 1,048 1,582 1,627 1,412 1,061 1,380 1,823 % of Annualized Revenue 30.7 % 29.5 % 30.3 % 29.0 % 32.2 % 35.2 % 34.5 % 34.4 % 37.8 % In 2011, managed working capital, which we define as gross inventory plus gross accounts receivable less accounts payable, increased by $273.3 million, after adjustments for working capital acquired in the Ladish acquisition, due to increased business activity. The increase in managed working capital was a use of cash in 2011, as gross inventory increased $244.9 million and accounts receivable increased $79.8 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $51.4 million. In 2010, managed working capital increased by $318.5 million due to increased business activity and increased costs for certain raw materials. The increase in managed working capital was a use of cash in 2010, as gross inventory increased $250.8 million and accounts receivable increased $152.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $84.8 million. 34 Table of Contents Managed working capital as a percentage of sales has increased from historical levels due to a continuing shift in mix to more value added products, primarily in the High Performance Metals and Flat Rolled Products business segments, which have a longer manufacturing process. Days sales outstanding, which measures actual collection timing for accounts receivable, increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of increased international sales which have longer collection cycles. Gross inventory turns, which excludes the effect of LIFO inventory valuation reserves, decreased slightly at year end 2011. The Components of managed working capital were as follows: (in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Accounts receivable $ 709.1 $ 545.4 $ 392.0 Inventory 1,384.3 1,024.5 825.5 Accounts payable (490.7 ) (394.1 ) (308.6 ) Subtotal 1,602.7 1,175.8 908.9 Allowance for doubtful accounts 5.9 5.6 6.5 LIFO reserve 153.7 163.0 102.8 Corporate and other 60.9 35.3 43.0 Managed working capital $ 1,823.2 $ 1,379.7 $ 1,061.2 Annualized prior 2 months sales $ 4,820.6 $ 4,007.7 $ 3,076.4 Managed working capital as a % of annualized sales 37.8 % 34.4 % 34.5 % December 2011 change in managed working capital $ 443.5 Managed working capital acquired (170.2 ) Net change in managed working capital $ 273.3 Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions Capital expenditures, for 2011 were $278.2 million, compared to $219.1 million in 2010, and $415.4 million in 2009. Since 2004, we have transformed ATI by investing over $3.3 billion in capital expenditures and acquisitions, including $1.2 billion in 2011. Virtually all of these investments have been in the United States and more than 75% has been self funded. We have significantly expanded and continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet current and expected demand growth from the aerospace (engine and airframe) and defense, oil and gas, chemical process industry, electrical energy, and medical markets, especially for titanium and titanium based alloys, nickel based alloys and superalloys, specialty alloys, and exotic alloys. Significant capital expenditures completed or in progress include: The expansion of ATIs aerospace quality titanium sponge production capabilities. Titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products. Our greenfield premium grade titanium sponge (jet engine rotating parts) facility in Rowley, UT, with a total cost of approximately $500 million, continued to ramp up production during 2011, and we expect to complete the standard grade qualification process by the end of the first quarter 2012, to be followed by premium grade qualification. When this Utah sponge facility is fully operational, our total annual sponge production capacity, including our Albany, OR standard grade titanium sponge facility, is projected to be approximately 46 million pounds. These secure supply sources are intended to reduce our purchased titanium sponge and purchased titanium scrap requirements. In addition, the Utah facility will have the infrastructure in place to further expand annual capacity by approximately 18 million pounds, bringing the total annual capacity at that facility to 42 million pounds, if needed. The design and construction of a new advanced specialty metals hot rolling and processing facility at our existing Flat Rolled Products segment Brackenridge, PA site for approximately $1.1 billion. The facility construction is progressing on schedule, with construction expected to be completed by the end of 2013 and commissioning occurring in the first half of 2014. The new hot rolling and processing facility is designed to be the most powerful mill in the world for production of specialty metals. It is designed to produce exceptional quality, thinner, and wider hot rolled coils at reduced cost with shorter lead times, and require lower working capital requirements. When completed, we believe ATIs new hot rolling and processing facility will provide unsurpassed manufacturing capability and versatility in the production of a wide range of flat rolled specialty metals. We expect improved productivity, lower costs, and higher quality for our diversified product mix of flat rolled specialty metals, including nickel based and specialty alloys, titanium and titanium alloys, zirconium alloys, Precision Rolled Strip &reg; products, and stainless sheet and coiled plate products. It is designed to roll and process exceptional quality hot bands of up to 78.62 inches, or 2 meters, wide. 35 Table of Contents The expansion of our High Performance Metals segment production capabilities in North Carolina. Our fourth cold hearth plasma arc melt (PAM) furnace for melting premium titanium alloys is in the qualification stage and is expected to support our growth in demand for high value products in 2012. The PAM furnace is a superior cold hearth melting process for making alloyed premium titanium products for jet engine rotating parts, medical applications, and other critical applications. Our titanium alloys and nickel based alloys and superalloys forging facility, which was constructed in phases through 2009 and is now fully in service, includes a new 10,000 ton press forge and a new 700mm radial forge, both of which we believe are the largest of their kind in the world for producing these types of alloys. The facility also includes billet conditioning and finishing equipment. In May 2011, ATI completed the acquisition of Ladish Co., Inc. for $897.6 million, comprised of the issuance of 7.3 million shares of ATI common stock and payment of $384 million in cash. Based in Wisconsin, ATI Ladish engineers, produces and markets high strength, high technology forged and cast metal components for a wide variety of load bearing and fatigue resisting applications in the jet engine, aerospace and industrial markets, for both domestic and international customers. We currently expect that our 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $485 million all of which we expect to fund from operating cash flow and available cash on hand. Debt Total debt outstanding increased by $446.0 million, to $1,509.3 million at December 31, 2011, from $1,063.3 million at December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $500 million of 5.95% Notes due 2021. Additionally, $84.3 million of indebtedness was assumed in the Ladish acquisition. These amounts were offset by the retirement of $117.0 million of 2011 Notes in December of 2011. In managing our overall capital structure, some of the measures on which we focus are net debt to total capitalization, which is the percentage of our debt, net of cash that may be available to reduce borrowings, to our total invested and borrowed capital, and total debt to total capitalization, which excludes cash balances. At year end 2011, our net debt to total capitalization was 31.3%, compared to 23.6% at December 31, 2010, and 15.3% at December 31, 2009. Total debt to total capitalization was 37.9% at December 31, 2011 compared to 34.3% at December 31, 2010, and 34.7% at December 31, 2009.

The facility includes a $200 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Under the terms of the facility, we may increase the size of the credit facility by up to $100 million without seeking the further approval of the lending group. The facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization) of not greater than 3.25, and maintain an interest coverage ratio (consolidated earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest expense) of not less than 2.0. At December 31, 2011, our leverage ratio was 1.78 and our interest coverage ratio was 5.31. The definition of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes, and consolidated earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization as used in the interest coverage and leverage ratios excludes any non cash pension expense or income, and consolidated indebtedness in the leverage ratio is net of cash on hand in excess of $50 million. We were in compliance with these required ratios during all applicable periods. As of December 31, 2011, there had been no borrowings made under the facility, although a portion of the facility was used to support approximately $7 million in letters of credit. 36 Table of Contents We have an additional, separate credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2011, $31 million in letters of credit were outstanding under this facility. STAL, our Chinese joint venture company in which ATI has a 60% interest, has a revolving credit facility with a group of banks which extends through early August 2012. Under the credit facility, STAL may borrow up to 205 million renminbi (approximately $32 million at December 2011 exchange rates) at an interest rate equal to 90% of the applicable lending rate published by the Peoples Bank of China. The credit facility is supported solely by STALs financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners, and is intended to be utilized in the future for the expansion of STALs operations, which are located in Shanghai, China. The credit facility requires STAL to maintain a minimum level of shareholders equity, and certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2011, there had been no borrowings made under this credit facility.

(C) We have contracted for physical delivery for certain of our raw materials to meet a portion of our needs. These contracts are based upon fixed or variable price provisions. We used current market prices as of December 31, 2011, for raw material obligations with variable pricing. (D) We have various contractual obligations that extend through 2016 for services involving production facilities and administrative operations. Our purchase obligation as disclosed represents the estimated termination fees payable if we were to exit these contracts. (E) Drawn amounts were $24.5 million at December 31, 2011 under foreign credit agreements, and drawn amounts are included in total debt. Drawn amounts also include $6.8 million utilized under the $400 million domestic senior unsecured credit facility for standby letters of credit, which renew annually, and $31.0 million under a separate letter of credit facility. These letters of credit are used to support: $29.0 million in workers compensation and general insurance arrangements, and $8.8 million related to environmental, legal and other matters. Retirement Benefits At December 31, 2011, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan) was approximately 84% funded. In December 2011, the qualified defined benefit plans of ATI Ladish were merged into the U.S. Plan. The funded position of the U.S. Plan declined in 2011 primarily due to the use of a lower discount rate to value plan liabilities, and also due to lower than expected returns on plan assets. We have not been required to make cash contributions to the U.S. Plan since 1995, and we did not make a contribution during 2011. However, during the years of 2004 2009, we made $765.2 million in voluntary cash and stock contributions to this plan to improve the plans funded position. These voluntary contributions were comprised of cash contributions of $350 million in 2009, $30 million in 2008, and $100 million during each of 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, plus $50 million during 2004. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2008, we contributed 1.5 million shares of ATI common stock, valued at $35.2 million, to the pension plan. Based on current regulations and actuarial studies, we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to our U.S. Plan for 2012. However, we may elect, depending upon investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors, to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future. 37 Table of Contents We fund certain retiree health care benefits for Allegheny Ludlum using investments held in a Company administered Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) trust. This allows us the opportunity to generate investment returns to recover a portion of the retiree medical costs. In accordance with our labor agreements, during 2011, 2010, and 2009, we funded $5.2 million, $4.2 million, and $13.8 million, respectively, of retiree medical costs using the investments of this VEBA trust. We may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the investments held in this VEBA. The value of the investments held in this VEBA was approximately $9 million as of December 31, 2011. Dividends We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock for each quarter of 2011 and 2010. The payment of dividends and the amount of such dividends depends upon matters deemed relevant by our Board of Directors, such as our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by law, credit agreements or senior securities, and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate. Critical Accounting Policies The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality. Inventories At December 31, 2011, we had net inventory of $1,384.3 million. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last in, first out (LIFO), first in, first out (FIFO) and average cost methods) or market, less progress payments. Costs include direct material, direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs. Most of our inventory is valued utilizing the LIFO costing methodology. Inventory of our non U.S. operations is valued using average cost or FIFO methods. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have been extremely volatile during the past four years. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results, while, conversely, a fall in material costs results in a benefit to operating results. For example, in 2011, the effect of falling raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $9.3 million lower than would have been recognized had we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. Conversely, in 2010, the effect of rising raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $60.2 million higher than would have been recognized had we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. In 2009, the effect of falling raw material costs on our LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which were $102.8 million lower than would have been recognized had we utilized the FIFO methodology to value our inventory. In a period of rising prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Conversely, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. The LIFO inventory valuation methodology is not utilized by many of the companies with which we compete, including foreign competitors. As such, our results of operations may not be comparable to those of our competitors during periods of volatile material costs due, in part, to the differences between the LIFO inventory valuation method and other acceptable inventory valuation methods. We evaluate product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value. The calculation of a resulting reserve, if any, is recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified. At December 31, 2011, no significant reserves were required. It is our general policy to write down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months. In some instances this criterion is up to twenty four months due to the longer manufacturing and distribution process for such products. Asset Impairment We monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets. An impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an assets use (including any proceeds from disposition) are less than the assets carrying value, and the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Changes in the expected use of a long lived asset group, and the financial performance of the long lived asset group and its operating segment, are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment. Future cash flow value may include appraisals for property, plant and equipment, land and improvements, future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets, and other operating considerations. There were no significant charges for impairment of long lived assets in the periods presented. 38 Table of Contents Retirement Benefits We have defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all of our employees. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, benefit expenses recognized in financial statements for defined benefit pension plans are determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. A significant element in determining our pension (expense) income in accordance with the accounting standards is the expected investment return on plan assets. In establishing the expected return on plan investments, which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter, we take into consideration input from our third party pension plan asset managers and actuaries regarding the types of securities the plan assets are invested in, how those investments have performed historically, and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future. Our expected long term return on pension plan investments was 8.5% in 2011. We apply this assumed rate to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension (expense) income for the current year. The actual return on pension plan assets for the last five years have been 0.3% for 2011, 12.2% for 2010, 16.4% for 2009, a negative 25.3% for 2008, and 10.9% for 2007. Based upon our strategic allocation of pension assets across the various investments asset classes, and consideration of both historical and projected annual compound returns, our expected long term return on pension plan investments for 2012 remains 8.50%. The effect of increasing, or lowering, the expected return on pension plan investments by 0.25% results in additional pre tax annual income, or expense, of approximately $5.3 million. The cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods. The amount of expected return on plan assets can vary significantly from year to year since the calculation is dependent on the market value of plan assets as of the end of the preceding year. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to calculate the expected return on pension assets using either an average of fair market values of pension assets over a period not to exceed five years, which reduces the volatility in reported pension income or expense, or their fair market value at the end of the previous year. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission currently does not permit companies to change from the fair market value at the end of the previous year methodology, which is the methodology that we use, to an averaging of fair market values of plan assets methodology. As a result, our results of operations and those of other companies, including companies with which we compete, may not be comparable due to these different methodologies in calculating the expected return on pension investments. In accordance with accounting standards, we determine the discount rate used to value pension plan liabilities as of the last day of each year. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. In estimating this rate, we receive input from our actuaries regarding the rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments with maturities matched to the expected future retirement benefit payments. Based on this assessment at the end of December 2011, we established a discount rate of 5.0% for valuing the pension liabilities as of the end of 2011, and for determining the pension expense for 2012. We had previously assumed a discount rate of 5.8% at the end of 2010 and 6.2% for the end of 2009. The estimated effect of changing the discount rate by 0.50%, would decrease pension liabilities in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase pension liabilities in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $150 million. Such a change in the discount rate would decrease pension expense in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase pension expense in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $10 million. The effect on pension liabilities for changes to the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, are deferred and amortized over future periods in accordance with the accounting standards. As discussed above, gains and losses due to differences between actual and expected results for investment returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to value benefit obligations are deferred and recognized in the income statement over future periods. However for balance sheet presentation, these gains and losses are included in the determination of benefit obligations, net of plan assets, included on the year end statement of financial position. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $1.33 billion of pre tax net actuarial losses, primarily related to continued declines in the discount rate used to value pension obligations, and also due to negative investment returns on plan assets in 2008, which have been recognized on the balance sheet through a reduction in stockholders equity, and are being recognized in the income statement through expense amortizations over future years. We also sponsor several postretirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees and retirees. These plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Under most of the plans, our contributions towards premiums are capped based upon the cost as of certain dates, thereby creating a defined contribution. For the non collectively bargained plans, we maintain the right to amend or terminate the plans in the future. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting standards, postretirement expenses recognized in financial statements associated with defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as benefits are paid. We use actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for these plans. The discount rate, which is determined annually at the end of each year, is developed based upon rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. At the end of 2011, we determined the rate to be 5.0%, compared to a 5.8% discount rate in 2010, and a 6.2% discount rate in 2009. The estimated effect of changing the discount rate by 0.50%, would decrease postretirement obligations in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase postretirement obligations in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $22 million. Such a change in the discount rate would decrease postretirement benefit expense in the case of an increase in the discount rate, or increase postretirement benefit expense in the case of a decrease in the discount rate by approximately $0.6 million. Based upon predictions of continued significant medical cost inflation in future years, the annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits of health care plans is 9.1% in 2012 and is assumed to gradually decrease to 5.0% in the year 2028 and remain level thereafter. 39 Table of Contents Certain of these postretirement benefits are funded using plan investments held in a Company administered VEBA trust. The December 31, 2011 asset balance is $9 million and consists primarily of private equity investments. For 2011, our expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust was 8.3%, and our actual investment return was 17.6%. This assumed long term rate of return on investments is applied to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year. This produces the expected return on plan investments that is included in annual postretirement benefits expenses for the current year. Our expected return on investments in the VEBA trust is 8.3% for 2012. The expected return on investments held in the VEBA trust is lower than the return on pension plan investments due to the mix of assets held by the VEBA trust and the expected reduction of VEBA trust assets due to benefit payments. The effect of increasing, or lowering, the expected return on postretirement benefit plan investments by 0.25% has a negligible effect on pre tax annual income, or expense, due to the low level of investments held. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted On January 1, 2011, we prospectively adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements. These changes affect the accounting and reporting of revenues related to bundled sales arrangements with customers to provide multiple products and services at different points in time or over different time periods. The adoption of these changes had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2011, we adopted changes issued by the FASB to disclosure requirements for disaggregated disclosure of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, which are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In September 2011, the FASB issued changes to the disclosure requirements for employers who participate in multiemployer pension plans. The new standards require an employer to provide additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including disclosure of the significant multiemployer plans in which an employer participates, the level of an employers participation in the significant multiemployer plans, including the employers contributions made to the plans and an indication of whether the employers contributions represent more than 5 percent of the total contributions made to the plan by all contributing employers. Additionally, the financial health of the significant multiemployer plans, including an indication of the funded status, whether funding improvement plans are pending or implemented, and whether the plan has imposed surcharges on the contributions to the plan. Finally, the required disclosures include the nature of the employer commitments to the plan, including when the collective bargaining agreements that require contributions to the significant plans are set to expire and whether those agreements require minimum contributions to be made to the plans. These disclosures are included in Note 10. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits in the notes to the 2011 consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued changes to the testing of goodwill for impairment. The changes are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance which provides us with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two step quantitative impairment test. Forward Looking Statements From time to time, the Company has made and may continue to make forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements in this report relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, would, should, will, will likely result, forecast, outlook, projects, and similar expressions. Such forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which the Company is unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results or performance to materially differ from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such statements. Various of these factors are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and will be described from time to time in the Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Companys Annual Reports on Form 10 K and the Companys subsequent reports filed with the SEC on Form 10 Q and Form 8 K, which are available on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov and on the Companys website at http://www.atimetals.com. We assume no duty to update our forward looking statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As part of our risk management strategy, we utilize derivative financial instruments, from time to time, to hedge our exposure to changes in raw material prices, foreign currencies, and interest rates. We monitor the third party financial institutions which are our counterparty to these financial instruments on a daily basis and diversify our transactions among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Fair values for derivatives were measured using exchange traded prices for the hedged items including consideration of counterparty risk and the Companys credit risk. 40 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk. We attempt to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $25 million of floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.6%. Since the interest rate on floating rate debt changes with the short term market rate of interest, we are exposed to the risk that these interest rates may increase, raising our interest expense. For example, a hypothetical 1% increase in the rate of interest on the $25 million of our outstanding floating rate debt would result in increased annual financing costs of approximately $0.3 million. Volatility of Energy Prices. Energy resources markets are subject to conditions that create uncertainty in the prices and availability of energy resources. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, have and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We use approximately 8 to 10 million MMBtus of natural gas annually, depending upon business conditions, in the manufacture of our products. These purchases of natural gas expose us to risk of higher gas prices. For example, a hypothetical $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of approximately $8 to $10 million. We use several approaches to minimize any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations from volatile energy prices. These approaches include incorporating an energy surcharge on many of our products and using financial derivatives to reduce exposure to energy price volatility. At December 31, 2011, the outstanding financial derivatives used to hedge our exposure to natural gas cost volatility represented approximately 70% of our forecasted requirements for 2012, 50% for 2013 and 10% for 2014. The net mark to market valuation of these outstanding hedges at December 31, 2011 was an unrealized pre tax loss of $13.4 million, of which $10.1 million was presented in accrued liabilities and $3.3 million was presented in other long term liabilities. The effects of the hedging activity will be recognized in income over the designated hedge periods. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the effects of natural gas hedging activity increased cost of sales by $12.5 million. Volatility of Raw Material Prices. We use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of increased raw material costs; however, competitive factors in the marketplace can limit our ability to institute such mechanisms, and there can be a delay between the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefit of such mechanisms. For example, in 2011 we used approximately 95 million pounds of nickel; therefore a hypothetical change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately $95 million. In addition, in 2011 we also used approximately 810 million pounds of ferrous scrap in the production of our flat rolled products and a hypothetical change of $0.01 per pound would result in increased costs of approximately $8 million. While we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations, such as for nickel, we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure. We believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts, but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials. The majority of our products are sold utilizing raw material surcharges and index mechanisms. However as of December 31, 2011, we had entered into financial hedging arrangements primarily at the request of our customers related to firm orders, for an aggregate amount of less than 9% of our estimated annual nickel requirements. These nickel hedges extend to 2016. Any gain or loss associated with these hedging arrangements is included in cost of sales. At December 31, 2011, the net mark to market valuation of our outstanding raw material hedges was an unrealized pre tax gain of $0.1 million, comprised of $0.7 million in prepaid expenses, $1.1 million in other current assets, $1.6 million in accrued liabilities and $0.1 million in other long term liabilities. Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used, from time to time, to limit transactional exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We sometimes purchase foreign currency forward contracts that permit us to sell specified amounts of foreign currencies expected to be received from our export sales for pre established U.S. dollar amounts at specified dates. The forward contracts are denominated in the same foreign currencies in which export sales are denominated. These contracts are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows of a portion of the forecasted future export sales transactions which otherwise would expose the Company to foreign currency risk. At December 31, 2011, the outstanding financial derivatives used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency, primarily euros, represented approximately 10% of our forecasted total international sales through 2013. At December 31, 2011, the net mark to market valuation of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was an unrealized pre tax gain of $15.4 million, of which $9.5 million is included in prepaid expenses and other assets and $5.9 million is presented in other long term assets. In addition, we may also designate cash balances held in foreign currencies as hedges of forecasted foreign currency transactions. 41 Table of Contents
