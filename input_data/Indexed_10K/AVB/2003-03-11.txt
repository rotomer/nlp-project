ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K, including the footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements which immediately follow, contains forward looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10 K, that predict or indicate future events and trends or that do not report historical matters. In addition, information concerning the following are forward looking statements: the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; cost, yield and earnings estimates; and the development of management information systems by companies in which we have an investment and our implementation and use of those systems. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. You should not rely on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development and increases in the cost of capital; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest expense and construction costs and reduced rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flow from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline and could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in managing our current growth in the number of apartment communities; and companies developing software applications and ancillary services in which we have invested may be unsuccessful in achieving their business plans or unsuccessful in obtaining additional funding, which could lead to a partial or complete loss of our investment in these companies. 37 You should read our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes included in this report in conjunction with the following discussion. These forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update these forward looking statements, and you should not rely upon them after the date of this report. Business Description and Community Information We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. We focus on the ownership and operation of upscale apartment communities (which generally command among the highest rents in their submarkets) in high barrier to entry markets of the United States. This is because we believe that, long term, the limited new supply of upscale apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle. However, we are in a period of a business cycle where rents are resetting to lower levels, resulting in a decline in cash flows in 2002 compared to 2001. These barriers to entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land (in fill locations) is in limited supply. Our markets are located in the Northeast, Mid Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. We are a fully integrated real estate organization with in house expertise in the following areas: development and redevelopment; construction and reconstruction; leasing and management; acquisition and disposition; financing; marketing; and information technologies. We believe apartment communities present an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should result in relatively stable demand over a real estate cycle. We intend to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist and where new household formations are expected to out pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle. A number of our markets are experiencing economic contraction due to continuing job losses, particularly in the technology, telecom and financial services sectors. We expect these conditions to continue for most of 2003. Although we believe we are well positioned to continue to pursue opportunities to develop and acquire upscale apartment homes based on our in house capabilities and expertise, we expect to decrease acquisition and development activity during 2003 as compared to prior years and plan to increase disposition activity. The level of disposition, acquisition or development volume is heavily influenced by capital market conditions, including prevailing interest rates. Given current capital market and real estate market conditions, we are evaluating the appropriate allocation of capital investment among development and redevelopment communities, the acquisition of existing communities, and stock redemptions/repurchases. In addition, we expect to increase disposition activity to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle as well as to provide additional liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Future Financing and Capital Needs. Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development, and development rights (i.e., land or land options held for development). Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease Up and Redevelopment. A description of these categories and operating performance information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 38 On December 31, 2002, we owned or had an ownership interest in these categories as follows: Number of Number of communities apartment homes Current Communities Established Communities: Northeast 27 7,196 Mid Atlantic 18 5,154 Midwest 9 2,624 Pacific Northwest 3 907 Northern California 29 8,601 Southern California 11 3,404 Total Established 97 27,886 Other Stabilized Communities: Northeast 11 3,040 Mid Atlantic 2 960 Midwest Pacific Northwest 8 2,152 Northern California 2 499 Southern California 6 2,253 Total Other Stabilized 29 8,904 Lease Up Communities 9 2,300 Redevelopment Communities 2 1,089 Total Current Communities 137 40,179 Development Communities 12 3,429 Development Rights 38 9,950 39 Results of Operations and Funds From Operations A comparison of our operating results for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 follows (dollars in thousands): Change Change 2002 2001 $ % 2001 2000 $ % Revenue: Rental income $ 630,502 $ 629,545 $ 957 0.2 % $ 629,545 $ 564,613 $ 64,932 11.5 % Management fees 1,355 1,325 30 2.3 % 1,325 1,051 274 26.1 % Other income 7,109 2,953 4,156 140.7 % 2,953 401 2,552 636.4 % Total revenue 638,966 633,823 5,143 0.8 % 633,823 566,065 67,758 12.0 % Expenses: Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes 144,424 126,698 17,726 14.0 % 126,698 112,522 14,176 12.6 % Property taxes 56,352 51,686 4,666 9.0 % 51,686 46,409 5,277 11.4 % Total community operating expenses 200,776 178,384 22,392 12.6 % 178,384 158,931 19,453 12.2 % Net operating income 438,190 455,439 (17,249 ) (3.8 %) 455,439 407,134 48,305 11.9 % Property management and other indirect operating expenses 32,163 32,967 (804 ) (2.4 %) 32,967 28,111 4,856 17.3 % Interest expense 121,380 103,189 18,191 17.6 % 103,189 83,582 19,607 23.5 % Depreciation expense 143,782 128,642 15,140 11.8 % 128,642 120,915 7,727 6.4 % General and administrative expense 14,332 15,224 (892 ) (5.9 %) 15,224 13,013 2,211 17.0 % Impairment loss 6,800 6,800 100.0 % Total other expenses 318,457 280,022 38,435 13.7 % 280,022 245,621 34,401 14.0 % Equity in income of unconsolidated entities 55 856 (801 ) (93.6 %) 856 2,428 (1,572 ) (64.7 %) Interest income 3,978 6,823 (2,845 ) (41.7 %) 6,823 4,764 2,059 43.2 % Minority interest in consolidated partnerships (2,570 ) (597 ) (1,973 ) 330.5 % (597 ) (1,908 ) 1,311 (68.7 %) Income before gain on sale of communities 121,196 182,499 (61,303 ) (33.6 %) 182,499 166,797 15,702 9.4 % Gain on sale of communities 62,852 (62,852 ) (100.0 %) 62,852 40,779 22,073 54.1 % Income from continuing operations 121,196 245,351 (124,155 ) (50.6 %) 245,351 207,576 37,775 18.2 % Discontinued operations: Operating income 3,529 3,646 (117 ) (3.2 %) 3,646 3,028 618 20.4 % Gain on sale of communities 48,893 48,893 100.0 % Total discontinued operations 52,422 3,646 48,776 1,337.8 % 3,646 3,028 618 20.4 % Net income 173,618 248,997 (75,379 ) (30.3 %) 248,997 210,604 38,393 18.2 % Dividends attributable to preferred stock (17,896 ) (32,497 ) 14,601 (44.9 %) (32,497 ) (39,779 ) 7,282 (18.3 %) Net income available to common stockholders $ 155,722 $ 216,500 $ (60,778 ) (28.1 %) $ 216,500 $ 170,825 $ 45,675 26.7 % Net income available to common stockholders decreased $60,778,000 (28.1%) to $155,722,000 in 2002. This decrease is primarily attributable to fewer gains on sales of communities in 2002, coupled with a decline in net operating income due to deteriorating market conditions in several of our principal markets and increases in interest and depreciation expenses. Net income available to common stockholders increased by $45,675,000 (26.7%) to $216,500,000 in 2001 due to additional net operating income from newly developed and redeveloped communities, as well as growth in net operating income from Established Communities and increased gain on sale of communities. 40 Net operating income (NOI) is calculated at the community level and represents total revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes, and excludes property management and other indirect operating expenses, interest expense, depreciation expense, general and administrative expense and impairment losses. We believe that NOI is an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand the recurring operations of our real estate portfolio, as well as provide insight into how management evaluates operations on a segment basis. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A calculation of NOI, along with a reconciliation to net income, is provided in the preceding table. The NOI decrease of $17,249,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the increase of $48,305,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories: 2002 2001 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Established Communities $ (36,680,000 ) $ 21,783,000 Other Stabilized Communities 10,830,000 23,267,000 Communities sold (13,037,000 ) (12,841,000 ) Development and Redevelopment Communities 21,638,000 16,096,000 Total NOI $ (17,249,000 ) $ 48,305,000 The NOI decrease in Established Communities in 2002 was largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in many of our submarkets. Strong single family home sales, partially fueled by a low mortgage rate environment, in addition to continuing job losses in many of our submarkets, have aggravated a weak demand environment, causing market rental rates and occupancies to decline. We currently expect to continue to experience weak demand during most of 2003. We also anticipate that any growth or improvement that we may experience in late 2003 will be at a slower rate than that experienced by the overall market and economy, if any, due to the types of industries (technology, telecom, financial services) that make up a large proportion of the jobs in our markets. Rental income increased due to rental income generated from acquired and newly developed communities offset by a decline in occupancies and effective rental rates for Established Communities. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 34,888 apartment homes for 2002 compared to 34,417 apartment homes for 2001 and 33,976 in 2000. This change in 2002 is primarily the result of increased homes available from acquired and newly developed communities, offset by occupancy declines related to the weakened demand in certain of our submarkets. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $1,522 in 2002 compared to $1,543 in 2001 and $1,402 in 2000. Established Communities Rental revenue decreased $30,679,000 (6.1%) in 2002 and increased by $26,268,000 (6.6%) in 2001. The decrease in 2002 is due to both declining effective rental rates and declining economic occupancy. The increase in 2001 is due to market conditions during the year that allowed for higher average rents partially offset by lower economic occupancy. For 2002, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased (4.1%) to $1,511 compared to $1,576 for 2001, partially due to increased concessions granted in 2002. The average economic occupancy decreased from 95.5% in 2001 to 93.5% for 2002. Economic 41 occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at contract rates and vacant homes at market rents. Although most of our markets have experienced weak demand, we have observed the most significant declines in average rental rates and occupancy during 2002 in certain Northern California and Northeast submarkets. Northern California, which accounts for approximately 32.0% of current Established Community rental revenue, experienced a decline in rental revenue in 2002, partially related to job losses in the technology sector. Although economic occupancy remained flat in Northern California in 2002 as compared to 2001, average rental rates dropped 12.6% from $1,788 to $1,562 for those same periods. The Northeast region also accounts for approximately 32.0% of current Established Community rental revenue and has been experiencing a decline in rental revenue, primarily the result of job losses in the financial services sector. Economic occupancy decreased in the Northeast, from 96.9% in 2001 to 92.6% for 2002, while average rental rates improved slightly during 2002. Other income increased primarily due to the recognition of $5,800,000 and $2,500,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, of business interruption insurance related to the settlement of a fire insurance claim that occurred during the construction of Avalon at Edgewater. In addition, we recognized $711,000 in the first quarter of 2002 in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased due to the addition of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment homes coupled with increased insurance, marketing and bad debt. Insurance expense has increased over the past two years, particularly during 2001 as the insurance and reinsurance markets deteriorated, resulting in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector. We renewed our general liability policy on August 1, 2002 and our property coverage on November 1, 2002. See Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses for a discussion of our insurance policies and related coverage. Insurance and other costs associated with Development and Redevelopment Communities are expensed as communities move from the initial construction and lease up phase to the stabilized operating phase. Marketing initiatives have been expanded in response to the weak demand, and bad debt expense has increased as a direct result of continuing job losses and the weakened economy. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $5,579,000 (6.1%) to $97,082,000 due to the increases in insurance, marketing and bad debt expenses discussed above. During 2001, operating expenses increased $3,559,000 (4.8%) due to increases in insurance, utilities, marketing and office and administration expenses. Property taxes increased due to higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes. Property taxes on Development and Redevelopment Communities are capitalized while the community is under construction. We begin to expense these costs as homes within the community receive a final certificate of occupancy. For Established Communities, the increases in property taxes in 2002 and 2001 of $550,000 and $969,000, respectively, were primarily due to higher assessments throughout all regions. Property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased in 2002 and increased in 2001 as a result of executive separation costs that were recognized in 2001 but not in 2002 or 2000. The decrease in 2002 is partially offset by increases in unallocated central marketing costs and abandoned pursuit costs. Similar to the community level, central marketing initiatives have been expanded in response to the weak demand. Abandoned pursuit costs increased $600,000 from $2,200,000 in 2001 to $2,800,000 in 2002 related to development rights which may not be developed as planned. 42 Interest expense increased in 2002 due to the issuance of $750,000,000 of unsecured notes between September 2001 and December 2002, partially offset by the repayment of $100,000,000 of unsecured notes in September 2002 and overall lower interest rates on both short term and long term borrowings. In addition, higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility resulted in higher interest expense between years. Interest expense increased in 2001 due to the issuance of $650,000,000 of unsecured notes during 2000 and 2001. Depreciation expense increased primarily related to acquisitions and completion of development or redevelopment activities. We expect depreciation expense to continue to increase as we complete additional development and redevelopment communities, partially offset by the elimination of depreciation of communities that are sold or designated as held for sale during 2003. General and administrative expense decreased in 2002 and increased in 2001 as a result of additional compensation expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2001 due to the retirement of a senior executive. Unfilled positions and lower incentive compensation also contributed to the decrease in 2002. Impairment loss of $6,800,000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land parcels that as of December 31, 2002 were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition. This loss was recorded to reflect the parcels at fair market value (based on their entitlement status as of December 31, 2002), less estimated selling costs. In February 2003, we won an appeal regarding the entitlement status of one of these parcels. If we decide to continue with the planned disposition, this change in entitlement status may increase the potential value of the land and therefore decrease the previously estimated loss that would be recognized at the date of disposal. However, we are currently reevaluating our plans for this parcel, which may result in 2003 in the partial recovery of the impairment loss recognized in 2002, if we decide to hold the land for development. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased during 2002 primarily due to losses recorded for an investment in a technology company accounted for under the equity method. During 2002 and 2001, we recorded losses of $3,166,000 and $1,730,000, respectively, related to this investment, bringing the carrying value of this investment to zero as of December 31, 2002. In addition, a $934,000 valuation allowance was recorded during 2001 for an investment in a different technology company which contributed to the decrease in 2001 over the prior year period. Interest income during 2002 decreased due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates. The increase in interest income during 2001 resulted from higher average cash balances invested. Gain on sale of communities, including discontinued operations, of $48,893,000, $62,852,000 and $40,779,000 were realized in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These gains on the sale of communities are the result of our strategy to sell communities that do not meet our long term strategic objectives and redeploy the proceeds to current Development and Redevelopment Communities. The amount of gains realized depend on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities, and the market conditions in the local area. In 2003, we expect to increase our disposition activity as compared to 2002. 43 Funds from Operations We consider Funds from Operations (FFO) to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps investors understand our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in this report. Consistent with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, we calculate FFO as: net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, except that excluded from net income or loss are gains or losses on sales of property (including any impairment loss on planned dispositions) and extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP); plus depreciation of real estate assets; and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. FFO should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Further, FFO as calculated by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of FFO. The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO and a presentation of GAAP based cash flow metrics (dollars in thousands): Years ended 2002 2001 2000 Funds from Operations Net income $ 173,618 $ 248,997 $ 210,604 Dividends attributable to preferred stock (17,896 ) (32,497 ) (39,779 ) Depreciation real estate assets 140,964 125,547 117,721 Depreciation discontinued operations 695 1,437 1,695 Joint venture adjustments 1,321 1,102 792 Minority interest expense 1,601 1,559 1,759 Gain on sale of communities, net of impairment loss on planned dispositions (42,093 ) (62,852 ) (40,779 ) Funds from Operations $ 258,210 $ 283,293 $ 252,013 GAAP based Cash Flow Metrics Net cash provided by operating activities $ 308,109 $ 320,606 $ 302,083 Net cash used in investing activities $ (440,331 ) $ (270,406 ) $ (258,155 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 72,589 $ (34,444 ) $ 5,685 Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Community Improvements Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize only non recurring expenditures. We capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item: exceeds $15,000; extends the useful life of the asset; and is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident. 44 Under this policy, virtually all capitalized costs are non recurring, as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred. Recurring make ready costs include the following: carpet and appliance replacements; floor coverings; interior painting; and other redecorating costs. We capitalize purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds $2,500. We generally expense purchases of personal property made for replacement purposes. For Established and Other Stabilized Communities, we recorded non revenue generating capitalized expenditures of approximately $302 per apartment home in 2002 and $251 per apartment home in 2001. The average maintenance costs charged to expense, including carpet and appliance replacements, related to these communities was $1,224 per apartment home in 2002 and $1,196 in 2001. We anticipate that capitalized costs per apartment home will gradually increase as the average age of our communities increases. We expect expensed maintenance costs to increase as the average age of our communities increases, and to fluctuate with changes in turnover. We have expanded our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report to include additional information on capital expenditures. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the amounts capitalized (excluding land costs) related to (i) acquisitions, development and redevelopment were $457,851,000 and $401,359,000, respectively, (ii) revenue generating expenditures, such as water sub metering equipment and cable installations were $697,000 and $1,675,000, respectively, and (iii) non revenue generating expenditures were $11,375,000 and $12,234,000, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity. The primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows have historically been determined by: the number of apartment homes; rental rates; occupancy levels; and our expenses with respect to these apartment homes. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, particularly to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets environment affect our plans for undertaking construction and development as well as acquisition and disposition activity. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $13,357,000 at December 31, 2002, a decrease of $59,633,000 for the year. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $308,109,000 in 2002 from $320,606,000 in 2001 primarily due to the decline in operating income from Established Communities and the loss of operating income from communities sold during 2002 and 2001, partially offset by additional operating income from newly developed and redeveloped communities. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $440,331,000 in 2002 related to investments in assets through development, redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of apartment communities. 45 During 2002, we invested $545,202,000 in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures. We began the development of seven new communities. These communities, if developed as expected, will contain a total of 1,987 apartment homes, and the total investment, including land acquisition costs, is projected to be approximately $371,200,000. We also completed the development of ten new communities containing a total of 2,521 apartment homes for a total investment, including land acquisition cost, of $466,600,000. We completed the redevelopment of two communities containing 1,116 apartment homes for a total investment in redevelopment (excluding acquisition costs) of $44,200,000. We acquired two communities containing 706 apartment homes for a total investment of $140,200,000, including the assumption of $33,900,000 in debt. We had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of $10,930,000 and non real estate capital expenditures of $1,142,000. The development and redevelopment of communities involve risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations. See Risks of Development and Redevelopment in Item 2 of this report for our discussion of these and other risks inherent in developing or redeveloping communities. We sold one community during 2002, generating net proceeds of $78,454,000. These proceeds are being used to develop and redevelop communities currently under construction and reconstruction, as well as to repay and redeem certain debt and equity securities, as discussed below. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $72,589,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to the issuance of unsecured notes and an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, partially offset by dividends paid, common stock repurchases, and the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock. See Note 3, Notes Payable, Unsecured Notes and Credit Facility, and Note 4, Stockholders Equity, in our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. We regularly review our short and long term liquidity needs, the adequacy of Funds from Operations, as defined above, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund: normal recurring operating expenses; debt service and maturity payments; the distributions required with respect to preferred stock; the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; opportunities for the acquisition of improved property; and development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged. We anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under the unsecured credit facility. One of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and long term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity. On January 15, 2003, $50,000,000 in unsecured notes matured and was paid, including the balance of accrued interest. During the remainder of 2003, we have 46 $100,000,000 in maturing unsecured notes. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness, it will be necessary for us to refinance this debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our credit facility or by additional equity offerings. We also anticipate having retained cash flow available in each year so that when a debt obligation matures, some or all of each maturity can be satisfied from this retained cash. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long term liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. Capital Resources. We intend to match the long term nature of our real estate assets with long term cost effective capital to the extent permitted by prevailing market conditions. From January 1, 2000 through February 1, 2003, we issued $1,100,000,000 of unsecured notes through public offerings. We expect this source of capital, together with cash flow from operating activities, dispositions, and other sources of capital, to remain available to meet our capital needs, for the foreseeable future, although no assurance can be provided that the debt capital markets will remain available or that such debt will be available on attractive terms. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility Our unsecured revolving credit facility is furnished by a syndicate of banks and provides up to $500,000,000 in short term credit. Under the terms of the credit facility, if we elect to increase the facility up to $650,000,000, and one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment, then we will be able to increase the facility up to $650,000,000, and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase; such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to commit to lend additional funds. We pay participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual facility fee of $750,000 in equal quarterly installments. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum (1.94% on February 28, 2003). Pricing could vary if there is a change in rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies; a change in rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by 0.05% to 0.15%. A competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $400,000,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. Pricing under the competitive bid option resulted in average pricing of LIBOR plus 0.34% for amounts most recently borrowed under the competitive bid option. The existing facility matures in May 2005 assuming exercise of a one year renewal at our option. At February 28, 2003, $155,470,000 was outstanding, $15,529,000 was used to provide letters of credit and $329,001,000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility. Interest Rate Protection Agreements We are not a party to any long term interest rate agreements, other than interest rate protection and swap agreements on approximately $166,000,000 of our variable rate tax exempt indebtedness. We intend, however, to evaluate the need for long term interest rate protection agreements as interest rate market conditions dictate, and we have engaged a consultant to assist in managing our interest rate risks and exposure. Future Financing and Capital Needs As of December 31, 2002, we had 12 new communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $254,146,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we had two communities under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $7,656,000 remained to be invested. 47 Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction will be funded from: the remaining capacity under our current $500,000,000 unsecured credit facility; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; retained operating cash; and or the issuance of debt or equity securities. We expect to continue to fund development costs related to pursuing development rights from retained operating cash and borrowings under the unsecured credit facility. We believe these sources of capital will be adequate to take the proposed communities to the point in the development cycle where construction can begin. Before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a development right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon development rights, write off associated pursuit costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such pursuits. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted by expanding development and acquisition activities and or reduced capital (as compared to prior years) available from asset sales. To meet the balance of our liquidity needs under such conditions, we would need to arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility, sell additional existing communities and or issue additional debt or equity securities. While we believe we have the financial position to expand our short term credit capacity and support our capital markets activity, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing these arrangements, sales or offerings. The failure to complete these transactions on a cost effective basis could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition, including the abandonment of development pursuits. It is our policy to sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria when market conditions are favorable, and to redeploy the proceeds. When we decide to sell a community, we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and tax ramifications of each proposal. We intend to actively seek buyers for communities that we determine to hold for sale. We expect to accelerate our disposition program during 2003 in response to current and anticipated real estate and capital markets conditions. However, we cannot assure you that assets can be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community is to reduce total revenues, total expenses and funds from operations. Therefore, an acceleration of our disposition program in 2003 may adversely impact total revenues and funds from operations. As of February 28, 2003, we have six communities classified as held for sale under GAAP. We are actively pursuing the disposition of these communities and expect to close during the first and second quarters of 2003. However, we cannot assure you that these communities will be sold as planned. We have minority interest investments in three technology companies, including Constellation Real Technologies LLC, (Constellation), an entity formed by a number of real estate investment trusts and real estate operating companies for the purpose of investing in multi sector real estate technology opportunities. Our original commitment to Constellation was $4,000,000 but, as a result of an agreement among the members reducing the commitment due from each member, our commitment is currently $2,600,000, of which we have contributed $959,000 to date. The remaining unfunded commitment of $1,641,000 is expected to be funded over the next five years. In January 2002, we invested an additional $2,300,000 in Realeum, Inc., (Realeum), a company involved in the development and deployment of a property management and leasing automation system. Pursuant to an agreement with Realeum, we utilize the property management and leasing automation system in exchange for payments under a licensing 48 arrangement. Realeum is negotiating licensing arrangements with other real estate companies that we are unaffiliated with. If unsuccessful in negotiating additional licensing agreements, Realeum may be required to obtain additional sources of funding. Our third technology investment is in Rent.com, an internet based rental housing information provider. We have no obligation to contribute additional funds to these technology investments, other than the commitment to Constellation as previously described.

Under this program, we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000. Actual purchases of stock will vary with market conditions. The size of the stock repurchase program was designed so that retained cash flow, as well as the proceeds from sales of existing apartment communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions, will provide the source of funding for the program, with our unsecured credit facility providing temporary funding as needed. Through February 28, 2003, we have acquired 2,042,600 shares at an aggregate cost of $77,381,000 under this program. Redemption of Preferred Stock In July 2002, we redeemed all 2,300,000 outstanding shares of our 8.50% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, plus $0.1417 in accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of $57,826,000, including accrued dividends of $326,000. The redemption price was funded in part by the sale on July 11, 2002 of 592,000 shares of Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock through a private placement to an institutional investor for a net purchase price of $14,504,000. The dividend rate on such shares was initially equal to 3.36% per annum (three month LIBOR plus 1.5%) of the liquidation preference. As permitted under the terms of such preferred stock, we redeemed all of the Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on August 29, 2002 for an aggregate redemption price of $14,609,000 including accrued dividends of $68,000. As of February 1, 2003, we have the following series of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at an aggregate stated value of $181,692,500. These series have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemptions. As these series become redeemable, we will evaluate the requirements necessary for such redemptions as well as the cost effectiveness based on the existing market conditions. Shares outstanding Payable Annual Liquidation Non redeemable Series February 1, 2003 quarterly rate preference prior to D 3,267,700 March, June, September, December 8.00 % $ 25 December 15, 2002 Currently Redeemable H 4,000,000 March, June, September, December 8.70 % $ 25 October 15, 2008 On February 18, 2003, we gave notice of our intent to redeem all 3,267,700 outstanding shares of our 8.00% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. We anticipate closing this redemption on March 20, 2003 at a price of $25.00 per share, plus $0.0167 in accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of $81,747,000, including accrued dividends of $55,000. This redemption will be funded by the sale of shares of Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock through a private placement to an institutional investor. The dividend rate on such shares will initially be based on three month LIBOR plus 1.5%. The Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock will be redeemable at any time at our option. 50 Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In the event of significant inflation, this may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, as is currently being experienced, we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases. Critical Accounting Policies Our accounting policies are in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies which we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. Additional discussion of accounting policies which we consider significant, including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below, can be found in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Real Estate Development Rights We capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include a charge to expense to provide an allowance for potentially unrecoverable capitalized pre development costs. The determination of the charge to expense involves management judgement regarding the probability that a pursuit will not proceed to development. Revenue Recognition Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. In accordance with our standard lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease generally one year. Real Estate If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community, our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of the community. If the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the community, we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value. 51 Discontinued Operations On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of any communities which have been sold during 2002, or otherwise qualify as held for sale as of December 31, 2002, be presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements in both current and prior periods presented. The community specific components of net income that are presented as discontinued operations include net operating income, depreciation and interest expense. In addition, the net gain or loss (including any impairment loss) on the eventual disposal of communities held for sale is presented as discontinued operations when recognized. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell, and are presented separately in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent to classification of a community as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. Investments in Technology Companies We account for our investments in technology companies in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment, our policy is to record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. A loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. Due to the nature of these investments, an impairment in value can be difficult to determine. Stock Based Compensation During the periods presented in this report, we applied APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, in accounting for our employee stock options. No stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. See Note 10, Stock Based Compensation Plans, in our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to stock based employee compensation. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or the results of operations. Once it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine. ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain financial market risks, the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates. We monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations. The effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results, such as rental rates and occupancy. The specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below. Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates. We had 52 $173,840,000 and $125,274,000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2002 and 2001, our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately $2,557,000 and $1,500,000, respectively, based on balances outstanding during the applicable years. We currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness. Under swap agreements, we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate (generally, the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into, plus a fixed increment), and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index. As of December 31, 2002, the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately $166,000,000 of our variable rate tax exempt debt. Furthermore, a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately $22,500,000 of unconsolidated variable rate debt exists as of December 31, 2002. The swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate tax exempt debt were not electively entered into by us but, rather, were a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our tax exempt bond financings. Because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an A or better credit rating by the Standard Poors Ratings Group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements, we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider. 53
