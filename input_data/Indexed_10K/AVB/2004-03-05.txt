ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, incorporated in the state of Maryland and focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the United States. As of December 31, 2003, we had 131 current operating communities, which are the primary contributors to our overall operating performance. The net operating income of these communities, which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance, is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels, and is affected by our ability to control operating costs. Our overall operating performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities. We create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms, deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets, operating apartments and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable. This report, including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, contains forward looking statements that predict or indicate future events and trends that do not report historical matters. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors set forth on page 54 of this report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. Business Description and Community Information Overview We believe that apartment communities present an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should result in relatively stable demand over a real estate cycle. We intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist, and where new household formations are expected to out pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle. Barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We evaluate the appropriate allocation of product type within our individual markets, which are located in the Northeast, Mid Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the United States, to ensure that our product mix will perform at a high level and achieve our portfolio objectives. Our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products (which is currently primarily upscale apartment communities) and services, with an intense focus on our customer. A substantial majority of our current communities are upscale (commanding among the highest rents in their submarkets). We also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal to offer a broad range of products and services. We believe that lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle. However, we believe we are toward the end of a period of the business cycle where rents have been resetting to lower levels, resulting in a decline in cash flows in 2003 as compared to prior years. A number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003, particularly in the technology, telecom and financial services sectors. This has resulted in continued weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates. However, the rate of decline has been diminishing, and we expect 2004 to be a year of transition. An improving economy with modest job growth is anticipated in 2004, which should result in the stabilization of apartment market fundamentals and an improved demand and supply balance during the year. Although we do not expect this to result in revenue growth for our current operating communities in 2004, it should curtail the significant declines in revenue that those communities experienced over the last two years. 38 With the expected transition of apartment fundamentals, we are preparing for a transition in certain aspects of our business activity. With our in house capabilities and expertise we believe we are well positioned to continue to pursue opportunities to develop, acquire and operate apartment homes in our target markets. However, the level of development or acquisition volume, or disposition activity, is heavily influenced by capital and real estate market conditions. During 2003, in response to capital markets conditions and strong apartment demand, we curtailed development and acquisition activity and increased our disposition activity. We sold assets that did not meet our long term investment criteria in markets where there was strong relative demand by investors in apartment communities. This allowed us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle, and provided additional liquidity. In 2004, we plan to continue our disposition activity, although at a reduced level, and expect to increase development and acquisition volume. Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development (Development Communities), and Development Rights (i.e., land or land options held for development), as further described in Item 2 of this report. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities, for which detailed discussions can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2003, we owned or held an ownership interest in 142 apartment communities containing 41,997 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which eleven communities were under construction and two communities were under reconstruction. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 40 communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 10,070 apartment homes. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical, in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain, and are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results. As a REIT that owns, operates and develops apartment communities, our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, cost capitalization, asset impairment evaluation and REIT status. A discussion of all of our accounting policies, including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 39 Revenue Recognition Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. In accordance with our standard lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease generally one year. A discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for Established Communities can be found in Results of Operations. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when active development commences until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. We capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. We capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights for which we currently believe future development is probable. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, deeming future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense. We generally capitalize only non recurring expenditures. We capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $15,000; (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident. Under this policy, virtually all capitalized costs are non recurring, as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred. Recurring make ready costs include: (i) carpet and appliance replacements; (ii) floor coverings; (iii) interior painting; and (iv) other redecorating costs. Because we expense carpet replacements, our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year following our peak summer leasing period. We capitalize purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds $2,500. We generally expense replacements of personal property. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the amounts capitalized (excluding land costs) related to acquisitions, development and redevelopment were $296,764,000, $457,851,000 and $401,359,000, respectively. For Established and Other Stabilized Communities, we recorded non revenue generating capital expenditures of $11,064,000 or $333 per apartment home in 2003, $10,214,000 or $302 per apartment home in 2002 and $7,967,000 or $251 per apartment home in 2001. In addition, revenue generating capital expenditures, such as water sub metering equipment and cable installations, were $529,000, $697,000 and $1,675,000, in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home, including carpet and appliance replacements, related to these communities was $1,262 in 2003, $1,224 in 2002 and $1,196 in 2001. We anticipate that capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home will gradually increase as the average age of our communities increases, and expensed maintenance costs will fluctuate with turnover. 40 Asset Impairment Evaluation If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community, our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of the community. If the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the community, we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell. We account for our investments in technology companies in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment, we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. Due to the nature of these investments, an impairment in value can be difficult to determine. REIT Status We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. 41 Results of Operations Our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions, net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions, the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market, disposition and financing activity.

This increase is primarily attributable to gains on sales of communities, including gains reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated entities, and the absence of impairment losses in 2003, partially offset by a decline in net operating income from our Established Communities, the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2002 and increases in interest and depreciation expense. Net income available to common stockholders decreased by $53,240,000 (25.5%) to $155,722,000 in 2002 due to fewer gains on sales of communities in 2002 and impairment losses recognized in 2002, coupled with a decline in net operating income from our Established Communities and increases in interest and depreciation, partially offset by a decrease in dividends attributable to preferred stock. 42 Net operating income (NOI) is defined by us as total revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes, and excludes corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses, interest income and expense, general and administrative expense, impairment losses, equity in income of unconsolidated entities, minority interest in consolidated partnerships, venture partner interest in profit sharing, depreciation expense, gain on sale of communities and income from discontinued operations. We believe that NOI is an important and appropriate supplemental measure to net income of the operating performance of our communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A calculation of NOI for the three years ending December 31, 2003, along with a reconciliation to net income, is provided in the preceding table. The NOI decreases of $1,519,000 and $15,893,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories: 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Established Communities $ (27,719,000 ) $ (34,380,000 ) Other Stabilized Communities 8,870,000 (871,000 ) Development and Redevelopment Communities 18,450,000 18,526,000 Non allocated (1,120,000 ) 832,000 Total $ (1,519,000 ) $ (15,893,000 ) The NOI decreases in Established Communities were largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in many of our submarkets. The continued impact of job losses in many of our submarkets, in addition to strong single family home sales, have aggravated a weak demand environment, causing market rental rates to decline in order to keep occupancies stable. Economic forecasts project modest job growth in our submarkets in 2004, and we therefore expect apartment market fundamentals to stabilize during the year. Although the rate of decline in the apartment market fundamentals is diminishing, which should curtail the significant declines in revenue that our Established Communities have experienced over the last two years, we expect our Established Communities revenue to decline as much as 2.0% in 2004 as compared to 2003 and operating expenses, particularly related to property taxes, to continue to increase up to 3.0% in 2004, resulting in continued year over year declines in our Established Communities NOI of up to 4.0% for 2004. Rental and other income increased in both 2003 and 2002 due to rental income generated from communities acquired in 2002 and newly developed communities, partially offset by declines in effective rental rates and business interruption proceeds. While we expect apartment fundamentals to stabilize in 2004 with modest job growth in our markets, there is typically a three to six month lag between improvements in job growth and improvements in operating performance. 43 Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 33,842 apartment homes for 2003 as compared to 31,694 apartment homes for 2002 and 31,131 in 2001. This change is primarily the result of increased homes available from communities acquired in 2002 and newly developed communities, partially offset by communities sold in 2002 and 2003. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $1,496 in 2003 as compared to $1,528 in 2002 and $1,550 in 2001 primarily due to the weakened demand in certain of our submarkets. Established Communities Rental revenue decreased $20,424,000 (4.3%) in 2003 and $28,400,000 (6.2%) in 2002. These decreases are due to declining effective rental rates, partially offset by a slight increase in economic occupancy in 2003. For 2003, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased (4.5%) to $1,437 compared to $1,505 for 2002, partially due to increased concessions granted in the latter half of 2002 and during 2003. The average economic occupancy increased from 93.6% in 2002 to 93.8% in 2003. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We expect rental income for Established Communities to decline as much as 2.0% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Although most of our markets have experienced weak demand caused by job losses, low mortgage rates and shifting demographics, rental income from Established Communities has been impacted the most by significant declines in average rental rates in certain Northern California and Northeast submarkets. Northern California, which accounted for approximately 31.0% of Established Community rental revenue in 2003, experienced a decline in rental revenue (7.6%) in 2003 as compared to 2002, partially related to the continued impact of job losses in the technology sector. Although economic occupancy in Northern California increased in 2003 as compared to 2002, average rental rates dropped 8.9% from $1,547 to $1,410. The Northeast region accounted for approximately 33.7% of Established Community rental revenue during 2003 and has also experienced a decline in rental revenue (3.7%) in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily the result of job losses in the financial services sector. Average rental rates dropped 3.6% from $1,876 to $1,808 in 2003 as compared to 2002, and economic occupancy remained flat during those same periods. In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term, which is generally one year. However, we consider rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP in helping investors to evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions, which is an indicator of current rental market conditions. The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our Established Communities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31, 2001 is not presented as Established Community classification is not applicable prior to January 1, 2002. See Note 9. Segment Reporting of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended 12 31 03 12 31 02 Rental revenue (GAAP basis) $ 450,000 $ 470,424 Concessions amortized 12,433 6,356 Concessions granted (14,817 ) (9,605 ) Rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis $ 447,616 $ 467,175 Year over year % change GAAP revenue (4.3 %) n/a Year over year % change cash concession based revenue (4.2 %) n/a 44 Concessions granted per move in for Established Communities averaged $848 during 2003, an increase of 104.8% from $414 in 2002. Concessions granted increased during 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to declining market conditions and a weak demand environment. We expect the high concessionary environment to continue into 2004. Management, development and other fees decreased during 2003 and increased during 2002 primarily due to the recognition in 2002 of $711,000 in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest. In addition, we managed fewer communities in 2003 as compared to prior years. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased in both 2003 and 2002 due to the addition of recently developed and redeveloped apartment homes and communities acquired in 2002, coupled with increased expenses due to inclement weather, insurance and bad debt expenses. In the first half of 2003, severe winter weather, primarily in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic, increased snow removal and utility costs by approximately $1,440,000. In addition, insurance expense has increased over the past two years as the insurance and reinsurance markets have deteriorated, resulting in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector. Recently property insurance rates began to decline. To benefit from declining rates, we completed an early renewal of our property insurance policy effective July 31, 2003. Accordingly, we expect a decline in property insurance premiums, which will result in flat or declining overall insurance costs for 2004 as compared to prior year periods. Bad debt expense has increased as a direct result of the continued impact of job losses and the weakened economy. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $5,724,000 (6.1%) to $99,853,000 in 2003 due to inclement weather, insurance and bad debt discussed above. During 2002, operating expenses increased $5,227,000 (6.5%) due to the increases in insurance, marketing and bad debt expenses. We expect expense growth to moderate in 2004 due to reduced property insurance costs and bad debt expenses. Property taxes increased in both 2003 and 2002 due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes. For Established Communities, property taxes increased in 2003 and 2002 by $1,470,000 and $879,000, respectively, primarily due to higher assessments throughout all regions. We expect property taxes to increase during 2004 as local jurisdictions look for additional revenue sources to balance budgets. We manage property tax increases internally and appeal increases when appropriate. Corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in 2003 as a result of increased legal expenses due to construction litigation relating to a community that has completed development, partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the implementation of a new property management leasing system in 2002 and a decrease in abandoned pursuit costs. During 2002, corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased as a result of executive separation costs that were recognized in 2001 but not in 2002, partially offset by an increase in abandoned pursuit costs. Abandoned pursuit costs related to Development Rights which are not probable for future development decreased $1,620,000 from $2,800,000 in 2002 to $1,180,000 in 2003. We expect corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses to increase in 2004 due to additional compensation costs, including growth due to the addition of newly developed communities and the expensing of options. Interest expense increased in both 2003 and 2002 primarily due to the issuance in late 2002 of unsecured notes and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility, partially offset by the repayment of certain unsecured notes and overall lower interest rates on both short term and long term borrowings. 45 Depreciation expense increased in both 2003 and 2002 primarily due to 2002 acquisitions and completion of development or redevelopment activities. General and administrative expense (GA) increased in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in our directors and officers (DO) insurance, which we renewed in March 2003. In the past year, the DO market has experienced increased and high profile claim activity resulting in higher insurance premiums. GA decreased in 2002 as a result of additional compensation expense recognized in 2001 due to the retirement of a senior executive. Unfilled positions and lower incentive compensation also contributed to the decrease in 2002. We expect GA to increase up to 15.0% in 2004 due to higher compensation expense and additional internal audit and corporate governance costs. Impairment loss of $6,800,000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition. No impairment losses were recorded in either 2003 or 2001. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased in 2003 primarily due to our $23,448,000 share of the gain recognized on the sale of a community accounted for under the equity method in which we held a 50% interest. During 2002, equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased primarily due to losses recorded for an investment in a technology company accounted for under the equity method. Interest income decreased in 2003 and 2002 due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates. Venture partner interest in profit sharing represents the income allocated to our venture partner in a profit sharing arrangement as discussed in Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The reduction in income/increase in expense in both years are due to increases in the net income of the underlying real estate as the related community moved out of the initial lease up phase and achieved stabilization. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities held for sale as of December 31, 2003 and communities sold during the period from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2003. The decreases in both years are primarily due to the sale of one community in 2002 and eleven communities in 2003. Gain on sale of communities, including discontinued operations, of $160,990,000, $48,893,000 and $62,852,000 were realized in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The amount of gains realized depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area. The large gains on sales of communities reflect our strategy to sell assets in a transactional market environment where buyers are offering prices that are historically high relative to current operating cash flow provided by these communities. We believe this is reflective of a broader trend in the capital markets, where investments with relatively secure yields and growth potential are being valued more highly than in prior years. A partial reversal of these trends could occur if long term interest rates rise significantly. We expect aggregate gains on community sales to decline in 2004 as we sell fewer assets. Dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased in both 2003 and 2002, primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during 2002 and 2003. In addition, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission clarification of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)Topic D 42, The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock, we have revised the presentation of our 2003 and 2001 operating results to include the initial offering costs as additional dividends of $280,000 and $7,538,000, respectively. 46 Funds from Operations (FFO) is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of property and excluding real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see Selected Financial Data, included in Item 6 of this report. 47 Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows have historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, particularly to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates, affect our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $7,196,000 at December 31, 2003, a decrease of $5,715,000 from $12,911,000 on December 31, 2002. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $239,815,000 in 2003 from $307,810,000 in 2002, primarily due to the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds and changes in NOI from Established Communities as discussed earlier in this report, coupled with the timing of payment of our property insurance premiums. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities of $33,935,000 in 2003 related to proceeds from asset dispositions, partially offset by investments in assets through development and redevelopment of apartment communities. During 2003, we invested $369,387,000 in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures: We began the development of seven new communities. These communities, if developed as expected, will contain a total of 2,025 apartment homes, and the total capital cost, including land acquisition costs, is projected to be approximately $399,200,000. We also completed the development of seven communities containing a total of 1,959 apartment homes for a total capital cost, including land acquisition cost, of $372,700,000. We had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of $11,593,000 and non real estate capital expenditures of $274,000. In addition, we sold twelve communities and one land parcel in 2003, including one community previously held through an equity investment, generating net proceeds of $403,118,000. These proceeds are being used to develop new communities and to partially repay amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility, which is discussed below. 48 Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $279,465,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the redemption of preferred stock, dividends paid, repayment of certain unsecured notes and common stock repurchases, partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, the issuance of mortgage notes payable and an issuance of common stock. See Note 3, Notes Payable, Unsecured Notes and Credit Facility, and Note 4, Stockholders Equity, of our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flow from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund: normal recurring operating expenses; debt service and maturity payments; preferred stock dividends and DownREIT partnership unit distributions; the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; opportunities for the acquisition of improved property; and development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged. We anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility We have a $500,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with J.P. Morgan Chase and Fleet National Bank serving as co agents for a syndicate of commercial banks. Under the terms of the credit facility, if we elect to increase the facility by up to an additional $150,000,000, and one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment, then we will be able to increase the facility up to $650,000,000, and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase; such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to commit to lend additional funds. We pay participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual facility fee of approximately $750,000 in quarterly installments. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum (1.70% on February 27, 2004). Pricing could vary if there is a change in rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies; a change in rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by 0.05% to 0.15%. A competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $400,000,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had $125,000,000 outstanding under this competitive bid option at February 27, 2004 priced at LIBOR plus 0.39%, or 1.48%. We are subject to (i) certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility, including, but not limited to, maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels, and (ii) prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed 95% of our FFO, except as may be required to maintain our REIT status. The existing facility matures in May 2004, unless we exercise a one year renewal at our option. We expect to renegotiate this facility prior to maturity without exercising the renewal option, however there can be no assurance that the renegotiation will occur. At February 27, 2004, $230,100,000 was outstanding, $22,304,000 was used to provide letters of credit and $247,596,000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility. 49 Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and long term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings. We also anticipate having retained cash flow available in each year so that when a debt obligation matures, a portion of each maturity can be satisfied from this retained cash. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long term liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. In February 2004, $125,000,000 in unsecured notes with an annual interest rate of 6.58% matured and was repaid with proceeds drawn under our unsecured credit facility. In addition, we repaid $11,381,000 in fixed rate mortgage debt secured by a current community, along with any unpaid interest, prior to its scheduled maturity of August 2004. No prepayment penalties were incurred. Also in February 2004, we had credit enhancements, including interest rate swaps, on approximately $87,380,000 of our variable rate, tax exempt debt that expired according to the original terms and that have not been extended. However, we have replaced the credit enhancements on this debt, including replacing the interest rate swaps with interest rate caps ranging from 6.7% to 9.0%. The underlying debt has a weighted average variable interest rate (exclusive of credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees fees, etc.) of 0.9% as of February 27, 2004, which has been capped at a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% through the interest rate caps. The credit enhancements, including the interest rate caps, mature in 2014. 50 The following table details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our unsecured credit facility, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands): All ininterest Principalmaturity Balance outstanding Scheduled maturities Community rate (1) date 12 31 02 12 31 03 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Tax exempt bonds Fixed rate Avalon at Foxchase I 5.88 % Nov 2007 $ 16,800 $ 16,800 (2) $ $ $ $ 16,800 $ $ Avalon at Foxchase II 5.88 % Nov 2007 9,600 9,600 (2) 9,600 Fairway Glen 5.88 % Nov 2007 9,580 9,580 (2) 9,580 CountryBrook 6.30 % Mar 2012 18,124 17,628 528 562 599 638 679 14,622 Waterford 5.88 % Aug 2014 33,100 33,100 (2) 33,100 Avalon at Mountain View 5.88 % Mar 2017 18,300 18,300 (2) 18,300 Avalon at Dulles (5) 7.04 % Jul 2024 12,360 Avalon at Symphony Glen 7.00 % Jul 2024 9,780 9,780 9,780 Avalon View 7.55 % Aug 2024 17,743 17,345 425 455 485 518 555 14,907 Avalon at Lexington 6.56 % Feb 2025 13,784 13,477 326 347 368 391 415 11,630 Avalon at Nob Hill 5.80 % Jun 2025 19,457 19,149 (2) 331 355 380 408 437 17,238 Avalon Campbell 6.48 % Jun 2025 35,749 35,065 (2) 733 786 843 904 969 30,830 Avalon Pacifica 6.48 % Jun 2025 16,216 15,906 (2) 332 356 382 410 440 13,986 Avalon Knoll 6.95 % Jun 2026 12,978 12,748 246 263 282 302 324 11,331 Avalon Landing 6.85 % Jun 2026 6,417 6,301 124 132 142 152 162 5,589 Avalon Fields 7.05 % May 2027 11,286 11,106 193 207 222 239 256 9,989 Avalon West 7.73 % Dec 2036 8,461 8,396 70 75 80 85 91 7,995 Avalon Oaks 7.45 % Feb 2041 17,628 17,530 104 112 120 128 138 16,928 Avalon Oaks West 7.48 % Apr 2043 17,336 96 103 110 117 125 16,785 287,363 289,147 3,508 3,753 4,013 40,272 4,591 233,010 Variable rate (4) Avalon at Laguna Niguel 2.55 % Mar 2009 10,400 10,400 10,400 The Promenade 3.08 % Jan 2010 33,670 33,185 522 562 605 652 701 30,143 Avalon at Mission Viejo 2.33 % Jun 2025 7,151 7,039 (3) 121 129 139 149 160 6,341 Avalon Devonshire (5) Dec 2025 27,305 Avalon Greenbriar 2.40 % May 2026 18,755 18,755 18,755 Avalon at Fairway Hills I 2.08 % Jun 2026 11,500 11,500 11,500 108,781 80,879 643 691 744 801 861 77,139 Conventional loans (6) Fixed rate $50 Million unsecured notes 6.250 % Jan 2003 50,000 $100 Million unsecured notes 6.500 % Jul 2003 100,000 $125 Million unsecured notes 6.733 % Feb 2004 125,000 125,000 125,000 $100 Million unsecured notes 6.750 % Jan 2005 100,000 100,000 100,000 $50 Million unsecured notes 6.500 % Jan 2005 50,000 50,000 50,000 $150 Million unsecured notes 6.926 % Jul 2006 150,000 150,000 150,000 $150 Million unsecured notes 5.178 % Aug 2007 150,000 150,000 150,000 $110 Million unsecured notes 7.128 % Dec 2007 110,000 110,000 110,000 $50 Million unsecured notes 6.625 % Jan 2008 50,000 50,000 50,000 $150 Million unsecured notes 8.374 % Jul 2008 150,000 150,000 150,000 $150 Million unsecured notes 7.634 % Aug 2009 150,000 150,000 150,000 $200 Million unsecured notes 7.665 % Dec 2010 200,000 200,000 200,000 $300 Million unsecured notes 6.792 % Sep 2011 300,000 300,000 300,000 $50 Million unsecured notes 6.314 % Sep 2011 50,000 50,000 50,000 $250 Million unsecured notes 6.261 % Nov 2012 250,000 250,000 250,000 Avalon at Pruneyard 7.250 % May 2004 12,870 12,870 12,870 Avalon Walk II 8.930 % Aug 2004 11,748 11,437 11,437 Avalon Orchards 7.650 % Jul 2033 20,574 222 237 254 272 292 19,297 2,009,618 1,879,881 149,529 150,237 150,254 260,272 200,292 969,297 Variable rate (4) Avalon on the Sound (7) 2.67 % Apr 2004 36,089 36,526 36,526 Total indebtedness excluding unsecured credit facility $ 2,441,851 $ 2,286,433 $ 190,206 $ 154,681 $ 155,011 $ 301,345 $ 205,744 $ 1,279,446 (1) Includes credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees fees, etc. (2) Financed by variable rate, tax exempt debt, but interest rate is effectively fixed at December 31, 2003 at the rate indicated through a swap agreement.

(6) Balances outstanding do not include $284 and $342 as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, of debt premium reflected in unsecured notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. (7) Variable rate construction loan matured in December 2002 and was refinanced in April 2003, extending the maturity date to April 2004, with a one year extension available to April 2005. 51 Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2003, we had eleven new communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $221,629,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we had two communities under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $5,660,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction, as well as development costs related to pursuing Development Rights, will be funded from: the remaining capacity under our current $500,000,000 unsecured credit facility; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; retained operating cash; and or the issuance of debt or equity securities. Before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights. We sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. We increased our disposition program during 2003 to a level totaling $453,900,000. In response to real estate and capital markets conditions, as well as strong institutional demand for product in our markets, we plan to continue to sell communities into 2004, although at reduced levels. However, we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce total revenues, total expenses, NOI and FFO. We intend to engage in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the possible formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities. This fund would serve, for a period of three years from the date of its final closing or until a significant portion of its committed capital is invested, as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions including, among others, significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions, properties acquired in tax deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund, if any. The fund would not restrict our development activities, which would not be a part of the fund, and would terminate after a term of eight years (subject to two one year extensions). We intend to actively pursue the formation of the fund, but there can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be formed or, if formed, what its size, terms or investment performance will be. We have preliminarily targeted that the fund would have approximately $715,000,000 available for investment (consisting of approximately $250,000,000 of fund equity, of which we would commit approximately 20% of the total, and approximately $465,000,000 of debt financing). We are also considering the use of several joint ventures, pursuant to which a portion of future developments would be held through a partnership vehicle. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. Each joint venture or partnership agreement will be individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. However, we cannot assure you that we will enter into joint ventures in the future, or that, if we do, we will achieve our objectives. 52 We have minority interest investments in three technology companies, one of which has a remaining unfunded commitment of $1,598,000, which we expect to be released from without payment in the first quarter of 2004. We have no other obligation to contribute additional funds to these technology investments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in unconsolidated real estate entities, with ownership interests up to 50%. One of these unconsolidated real estate entities, Avalon Terrace, LLC, has debt outstanding of $22,500,000 as of December 31, 2003, which matures in 2005 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed this debt, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entity be unable to do so. There are no lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. For more information regarding the operations of our unconsolidated entities see Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations We currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and office space. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long Term Debt Obligations(1) $ 2,337,533 $ 241,306 $ 309,692 $ 507,089 $ 1,279,446 Operating Lease Obligations 420,053 4,239 8,415 8,493 398,906 Total $ 2,757,586 $ 245,545 $ 318,107 $ 515,582 $ 1,678,352 (1) Includes $51,100 outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of December 31, 2003. The table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in 2004 See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Common and Preferred Stock Activity Stock Repurchase Program In 2002 our Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program, under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program was designed so that retained cash flow, as well as the proceeds from sales of existing apartment communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions, will provide the source of funding for the program, with our unsecured credit facility providing temporary funding as needed. Through February 27, 2004, we have acquired 2,380,600 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $89,566,000 under this program. We have not repurchased any shares of common stock since March 31, 2003. Issuance of Common Stock In August 2003, we completed a common stock offering totaling 2,804,700 shares at a public offering price of $46.00 per share. The net proceeds from this offering, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $127,333,000 were used to repay a portion of amounts outstanding on the unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes. 53 Shelf Registration Statement We currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The shelf registration statement originally provided $750,000,000 of debt and equity capacity, however, $127,333,000 has been utilized as a result of the common stock offering described above. We cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on cost effective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all times. Redemption of Preferred Stock In March 2003, we redeemed all 3,267,700 outstanding shares of our 8.00% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, plus $0.0167 in accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of $81,747,000, including accrued dividends of $54,000. The redemption price was funded by the sale of 3,336,611 shares of Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock through a private placement to an institutional investor for a net purchase price of $81,737,000. The dividend rate on such shares was initially equal to 2.78% per annum (three month LIBOR plus 1.5%) of the liquidation preference. As permitted under the terms of such preferred stock, we redeemed all of the Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in May 2003, for an aggregate redemption price of $82,207,000, including dividends of $251,000. We currently have the following series of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at a stated value of $100,000,000. This series has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemptions. Shares outstanding Payable Annual Liquidation Non redeemable Series February 27, 2004 quarterly rate preference prior to H 4,000,000 March, June, September, December 8.70% $25.00 October 15, 2008 Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In the event of significant inflation, this may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, as is currently being experienced, we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases. Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will 54 and other similar expressions in this Form 10 K, that predict or indicate future events and trends or that do not report historical matters.

We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. You should not rely on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development and increases in the cost of capital; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest expense and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flow from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. 55 These forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain financial market risks, the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates. We monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations. The effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results, such as rental rates and occupancy. The specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below. Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates. We had $168,505,000 and $173,840,000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2003 and 2002, our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately $2,665,000 and $2,557,000, respectively, based on balances outstanding during the applicable years. We currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness. Under swap agreements: we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate (generally, the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into, plus a fixed increment), and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index. As of December 31, 2003, the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately $157,500,000 of our variable rate, tax exempt debt. Furthermore, a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately $22,500,000 of unconsolidated variable rate debt existed as of December 31, 2003. The swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate, tax exempt debt were not electively entered into by us but, rather, were a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our tax exempt bond financings. Because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an A or better credit rating by the Standard Poors Ratings Group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements, we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider. Had these swap agreements not been in place during 2003 and 2002, our annual interest costs would have been approximately $6,027,000 and $5,674,000 lower, respectively, based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years. However, if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2003 and 2002 and these swap agreements had not been in place, our annual interest costs would have been approximately $4,581,000 and $4,024,000 lower, respectively. In addition, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness. Debt securities and notes payable (excluding our variable rate unsecured credit facility) with an aggregate carrying value of $2,286,433,000 at December 31, 2003 had an estimated aggregate fair value of $2,555,733,000 at December 31, 2003. Fixed rate debt represented $2,169,028,000 of the carrying value and $2,280,828,000 of the fair value at December 31, 2003. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of December 31, 2003, the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by $104,989,000. 56
