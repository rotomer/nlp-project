ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries (Avon or the Company) should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. When used in this discussion, the terms Avon, Company, we or us mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries. OVERVIEW We are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Our business is conducted worldwide, primarily in the direct selling channel. We presently have sales operations in approximately 63 countries and territories, including the United States, and distribute products in approximately 51 more. Our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in six regions: North America; Latin America; Western Europe, Middle East & Africa; Central & Eastern Europe; Asia Pacific and China. We centrally manage global Brand Marketing and Supply Chain organizations. Product categories include: Beauty, which consists of cosmetics, fragrances, skin care and toiletries; Beauty Plus, which consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel and accessories; and Beyond Beauty, which consists of home products and gift and decorative products. Sales from Health and Wellness products and mark, a global cosmetics brand that focuses on the market for young women, are included among these categories based on product type. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through approximately 5.3 million independent Representatives, who are independent contractors and not employees of Avon. The success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting, motivating and retaining Representatives. We view the geographic diversity of our businesses as a strategic advantage. In developed markets, such as the United States, we seek to achieve growth in line with that of the overall beauty market, while in developing and emerging markets we have higher growth targets. We have continued to experience strong growth from most developing markets, such as Brazil, Russia and Turkey, and significant contribution from another, Colombia, in which we acquired the Avon business of our licensee during the fourth quarter of 2005. We have also experienced signs of improvement in certain developed markets, such as the United States and United Kingdom. We are taking steps to address continued declines in certain other developed markets, Mexico and Japan, but challenges remain as these markets require longer term solutions. During 2006, we experienced growth in all segments, except Asia Pacific. In 2005, we launched a comprehensive multi year turnaround plan, described below, which seeks to take cost out of our business and reinvest those savings in initiatives that we expect to generate revenues as well as increase profitability over the long run. As part of this turnaround plan, in 2006 we invested ahead of savings and incurred incremental costs, including costs to implement restructuring initiatives, increased spending on advertising and higher inventory obsolescence expense. Operating profit during 2006 was negatively impacted by these costs associated with our turnaround plan. Additionally, higher compensation related expenses and expenses associated with the January 1, 2006, adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) negatively impacted operating profit. Strategic Initiatives In November 2005, we launched a comprehensive, multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth. Our four point turnaround plan includes: Committing to brand competitiveness by focusing research and development resources on product innovation and by increasing our advertising; Winning with commercial edge by more effectively utilizing pricing and promotion, expanding our Sales Leadership program and improving the attractiveness of our Representative earnings opportunity as needed; Elevating organizational effectiveness by redesigning our structure to eliminate layers of management in order to take full advantage of our global scale and size; and Transforming the cost structure so that our costs are aligned to our revenue growth and remain so. The turnaround plan is starting to deliver results. We attacked our cost structure, primarily through delayering, and we have reinvested ahead of savings from this and other cost savings initiatives. Our initial investments have focused significantly on advertising and our direct selling channel, where we have increased investments in 2006. During 2006, we increased our investment in advertising by 83% from $135.9 in 2005 to $248.9 in 2006, to support product launches, and in support of Avon Chinas direct selling launch. In 2007, we expect to increase our investment in advertising by 35% to almost $340.0. We are also committed to increasing our spending on product and brand innovation. In 2006, we launched several new innovative products, including Anew Clinical THERMAFIRM Face Lifting Cream, Anew Clinical EYE LIFT, superFULL mascara, Avon Solutions Ageless Results, Ultra Moisture Rich Metallic Lipstick, 18 Avon Crystal Aura fragrance, Avon Blue Rush fragrance and Derek Jeter DRIVEN fragrance. In 2007, we expect to implement a comprehensive strategy to reposition and rebrand our color line, including product innovation, upgrading packaging, a significant increase in advertising, improved merchandising and new brochure executions. We are forging alliances for our color line including alliances with a color make up artist and an international fashion designer. In 2007, we also plan to launch a global integrated marketing campaign, called Hello Tomorrow, supporting both the brand and the direct selling channel. Additionally, we expect to continue to reallocate the time our research and development department spends toward innovation and away from promotional items. We are also investing in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our Representatives (Representative Value Proposition). We have accelerated the roll out of our Sales Leadership program and have undertaken extensive analysis to better understand the drivers of value for our Representatives. In 2007, we will continue to look for ways to improve the earnings opportunity for Representatives through various means, including the following: Evaluating optimum commissions in select markets; Continuing to roll out our Sales Leadership Program, which offers Representatives an enhanced career opportunity; Strategically examining fee structure and brochure costs to enhance Representative economics; and Recalibrating the frequency of campaigns to maximize Representative selling opportunities. While the earnings and effort equation will be different within our global portfolio of businesses, we expect that web enablement will be a key element to reduce Representative effort worldwide. We will focus on improving Internet based tools for our Representatives. We will also focus on enhanced training of Representatives and field management. As part of our focus on brand competitiveness during 2006, we sought to reduce brand and margin dilution from the sale of heavily discounted excess products. As a result, we incurred higher inventory obsolescence expense of $20.5 during the first quarter of 2006, as it made more sense to discontinue selling these products rather than sell them at deep discounts and adversely affect sales of more profitable products. As the year progressed, we also launched our product line simplification program (PLS), which includes an analysis of our product line to develop a smaller range of better performing, more profitable products. This program is designed to improve the shopping experience, our brand image and Representative experiences by reducing the number of SKUs overall, which is expected to have significant savings implications. Over time we expect this initiative will: Improve customer service; Reduce complexity and confusion of our offering to customers and Representatives; Simplify our product line for effectiveness and efficiency; Impact the new product development decision making process; Improve life cycle management procedures; Improve inventory management; and Drive improved Supply Chain utilization. We incurred $81.4 of costs related to our PLS program during 2006, primarily incremental inventory obsolescence expense of $72.6. Depending on the results of additional PLS analyses that will be performed to identify the optimal product assortment over the next three years and timing of any resulting decisions, we may incur future costs related to PLS in the range of $100.0 principally in the form of inventory obsolescence charges. We expect to realize annualized benefits from PLS in the range of $200.0, with benefits building progressively over the next three years. Additionally, we are embarking on a strategic sourcing initiative (SSI) to reduce direct and indirect costs of materials, goods and services. Under this initiative, we will shift our purchasing strategy toward a global supplier orientation from one that is more local and component oriented. Beyond lower costs, our goal for this initiative is to improve asset management, service for Representatives and vendor relationships. We expect to realize initial benefits from SSI beginning in the second half of 2007, with annualized benefits from this initiative in the range of $200.0 by the end of 2009. We do not expect to incur any significant costs associated with this initiative. We have also begun the implementation of a Sales and Operating Planning process that is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues. We have begun to institutionalize a zero overhead growth methodology (ZOG) in which inflation is offset by improvements in productivity. These improvements in productivity will come primarily from previously announced initiatives such as our restructuring program, PLS and SSI. Restructuring Initiatives In connection with our four point turnaround plan, in November 2005 we announced a multi year restructuring plan. We expect to incur total restructuring charges and other costs to implement our restructuring initiatives in the range of $500.0 before taxes. We have incurred total costs to implement, net of adjustments, 19 of $285.3 ($228.8 in 2006 and $56.5 in 2005) for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the plan, primarily for employee related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits and professional service fees related to these initiatives. Approximately 85% of the restructuring charges incurred in 2006, have and are expected to result in cash expenditures, with a majority of the remaining cash payments expected to be made during 2007. Approximately 58% of the restructuring charges incurred in 2005 resulted in future cash expenditures. We expect to incur significant additional charges over the next few years. We expect our restructuring initiatives to deliver in excess of $300.0 of annualized savings when fully realized. The actions implemented to date resulted in savings of approximately $100.0 in 2006, most of which were associated with the delayering program that we completed in 2006. We expect that the actions announced to date will result in savings in the range of $230.0 in 2007. Specific actions during 2005, 2006 and January 2007 for this phase of our restructuring initiatives included: organization realignment and downsizing in each region and global through a process called delayering, taking out layers to bring senior management closer to operations; the phased outsourcing of certain services, including certain key human resource and customer service processes, and the move of certain services from markets within Europe to lower cost shared service centers; the realignment of our North America distribution operations; the exit of certain unprofitable operations, including the closure of the Avon Salon & Spa, the closure of our operations in Indonesia, the exit of a product line in China and the exit of the beComing product line in the U.S.; and the reorganization of certain functions, primarily sales related organizations. See Note 13, Restructuring Initiatives, on pages F 26 through F 28 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Outlook We expect that our investments in both the brand and the direct selling channel will drive sustainable growth and revenue growth should average mid single digits over the long term. Our operating margin during 2007 will be impacted by incremental investments in advertising and the Representative Value Proposition, as well as continued costs of restructuring and PLS. While operating margin should expand in 2007 from 2006s level of 8.7%, it is expected to be close to 2005s level of 14.1% in 2008. As the savings and benefits from restructuring, PLS and SSI begin to exceed the incremental levels of investment in advertising and the Representative Value Proposition, operating margin is then expected to further expand beginning in 2009. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123, which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant. The impact from the adoption of SFAS 123R during 2006, including restricted stock units granted in connection with design changes to share based compensation plans related to the adoption, decreased income before taxes and minority interest, net income, basic and diluted earnings per share, and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, by $49.2, $32.4, $.07 and $8.1 respectively, while it increased net cash provided by financing activities by $8.1. (See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Share Based Compensation Plans and Other Long Term Incentive Plan). Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R, (SFAS 158). We adopted SFAS 158 as of December 31, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a decrease to our shareholders equity by $254.7, on an after tax basis, a decrease to other assets of $232.8, an increase in accrued compensation of $35.5 and a decrease in employee benefit plans liability of $13.4. The adoption of SFAS 158 had no impact on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006, or for any prior period presented, and it will not affect our operating results in future periods. (See Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans). In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute, as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions for financial statement purposes. FIN 48 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. FIN 48 is effective January 1, 2007, for Avon. The impact of adopting FIN 48 is not expected to be material based on work performed to date, but we continue to assess the impact of FIN 48 along with implementation guidance as it is issued. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective January 1, 2008 for Avon. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 157 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Key Performance Indicators Within the following discussion and analysis, we utilize the key performance indicators (KPIs) defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business. KPI Definition Change in Active Representatives This indicator is based on the number of Representatives submitting an order in a campaign, totaled for all campaigns in the related period. This amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period, to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days (for example, holiday schedules). To determine the Change in Active Representatives, this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year. Change in Units This indicator is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period, as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year. Units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product (for example, gift with purchase or purchase with purchase), but exclude free samples. Inventory Days This indicator is equal to the number of days of estimated future months cost of sales covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies. Restructuring Reserves We record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Post Employment Benefits for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement. One time benefit arrangements and disposal costs, primarily contract termination costs, are accounted for under the provisions of FAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. We evaluate impairment issues under the provisions of FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. We estimate the expense for these initiatives, when approved by the appropriate corporate authority, by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans. These expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits, impairment of property, plant and equipment, contract termination payments for leases, and any other qualifying exit costs. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel. Such costs represent managements best estimate, but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time, including attrition rates. Estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if and adjustment is required. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable Representatives contact their customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the U.S. and a two to four week duration outside the U.S. The Representative purchases products directly from Avon and may or may not sell them to an end user. In general, the Representative, an independent contractor, remits a payment to Avon each sales campaign, which relates to the prior campaign cycle. The Representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid; however, there are circumstances where the Representative fails to make the required payment. We record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances. Over the past three years, annual bad debt expense has been approximately $135.0 to $145.0, or approximately 1.7% of total revenue. We generally have no detailed information concerning, or any communication with, any end user of our products beyond the Representative. We have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectibility of any accounts receivable balances due from the Representative to us. If the financial condition of our Representatives were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Allowances for Sales Returns We record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. Over the past three years, sales returns have been in the range of $285.0 to $295.0, or 21 approximately 3.5% of total revenue. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies, or for other reasons, additional allowances may be required. Provisions for Inventory Obsolescence We record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. In determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence, we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision. If actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence. Annual obsolescence expense was $173.3, $83.9 and $76.7 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As discussed in the Overview section, 2006 includes inventory obsolescence charges of $72.6 related to our PLS program and $20.5 related to our decision to discontinue the sale of heavily discounted excess products. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Expense We maintain defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Additionally, we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for certain current and retired executives (see Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans). Our calculations of pension, postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent upon the use of assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, interest cost, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, mortality rates, the number of associate retirements, the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 31, 2006, we had actuarial losses of $412.1 and $227.8 for the U.S. and non U.S. plans, respectively, that have not yet been charged to expense. These actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity in accordance with SFAS 158, which was adopted December 31, 2006. While we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension, postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense. For 2006, the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets, including the U.S. and non U.S. plans was 7.6%. In determining the long term rates of return, we consider the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies, historical rates of return and current economic forecasts. We evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary. The majority of our pension plan assets relate to the U.S. pension plan. The assumed rate of return for 2006 for the U.S. plan was 8.0%, which was based on an asset allocation of approximately 35% in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities (which are expected to earn approximately 5% to 7% in the long term) and 65% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 8% to 10% in the long term). Historical rates of return on the assets of the U.S. plan for the most recent 10 year and 20 year periods were 7.6% and 9.7%, respectively. In the U.S. plan, our asset allocation policy has favored U.S. equity securities, which have returned 8.0% and 11.8%, respectively, over the 10 year and 20 year periods. The actual rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. was approximately 13.1% and 5.5% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rates for our more significant plans, including our U.S. plan, were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan. The weighted average discount rate for U.S. and non U.S. plans determined on this basis was 5.43% at December 31, 2006, and 5.2% at December 31, 2005. Future effects of pension plans on our operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments, investment performance and funding decisions, among other factors. However, given current assumptions (including those noted above), 2007 pension expense related to the U.S. plan is expected to increase in the range of $3.0 to $5.0. A 50 basis point change (in either direction) in the expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases, would have had the following effect on 2006 pension expense: Increase/(Decrease) in Pension Expense 50 basis pointIncrease 50 basis pointDecrease Rate of return on assets $ (5.5 ) $ 5.5 Discount rate (11.2 ) 11.6 Rate of compensation increase 3.8 (3.7 ) 22 Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future, in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. We file income tax returns in many jurisdictions. In 2007, a number of income tax returns are scheduled to close by statute and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed. If Avons filing positions are ultimately upheld, it is possible that the 2007 provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments. Depending on the number of filing positions ultimately upheld, the impact of the adjustments could be significant to 2007 net income. Share based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant. We use a Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options. This model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share based compensation may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Loss Contingencies In accordance with FAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable. Our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation, which, by its nature is unpredictable. We believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED Favorable (Unfavorable)%/Point Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs.2005 2005 vs.2004 Total revenue $ 8,763.9 $ 8,149.6 $ 7,747.8 8 % 5 % Cost of sales 3,434.6 3,133.7 2,932.5 (10 )% (7 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 4,567.9 3,866.9 3,586.3 (18 )% (8 )% Advertising expenses (1) 248.9 135.9 127.6 (83 )% (7 )% Operating profit 761.4 1,149.0 1,229.0 (34 )% (7 )% Interest expense 99.6 54.1 33.8 (84 )% (60 )% Interest income 55.3 37.3 20.6 48 % 81 % Other expense, net 13.6 8.0 28.3 (70 )% 72 % Net income 477.6 847.6 846.1 (44 )% % Diluted earnings per share 1.06 1.81 1.77 (41 )% 2 % Gross margin 60.8 % 61.5 % 62.2 % (.7 ) (.7 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses as a % of total revenue 52.1 % 47.4 % 46.3 % (4.7 ) (1.1 ) Operating margin 8.7 % 14.1 % 15.9 % (5.4 ) (1.8 ) Effective tax rate 31.8 % 24.0 % 27.8 % (7.8 ) 3.8 Units sold 2 % 3 % Active Representatives 5 % 6 % (1) Advertising expenses are included within selling, general and administrative expenses. 23 Total Revenue Total revenue increased 8% in 2006. We continued to benefit from the fourth quarter 2005 acquisition of our licensee in Colombia, as that market contributed 3 percentage points to revenue growth. Foreign exchange also contributed 2 percentage points to the revenue growth. Revenue grew in Latin America, Western Europe, Middle East & Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, North America and China. Revenue declined in Asia Pacific. On a category basis, the 2006 increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase of 8% in Beauty sales. Within the Beauty category, fragrance increased 12%, skin care increased 6%, personal care increased 7% and color increased 3%. Beauty Plus sales increased 10% and Beyond Beauty sales increased 2%. Total revenue grew by 5% in 2005, with foreign exchange contributing 3 percentage points to revenue growth. During 2005, revenue grew in Latin America, Western Europe, Middle East & Africa, and Central & Eastern Europe, while revenue declined in North America and China. On a category basis, the 2005 increase in revenue was driven by increases in Beauty sales of 6% and Beauty Plus sales of 9% and a decrease in Beyond Beauty sales of 5%. For additional discussion of the changes in revenue by segment, see the Segment Review section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased .7 point during 2006, primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence provisions, which increased $89.4 in 2006. As discussed in the Overview section, 2006 includes charges related to our new PLS program and our decision to discontinue the sale of heavily discounted excess products. Depending on the results of additional PLS analyses that will be performed and timing of any resulting decisions, we expect to incur future additional obsolescence charges. Gross margin decreased .7 point in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to unfavorable product mix, pricing and higher inventory obsolescence expense. Gross margin during 2005 included $8.4 for inventory write offs related to our restructuring initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $701.0 during 2006, primarily due to $181.0 of incremental costs incurred to implement our restructuring initiatives and higher spending on advertising of $113.0. Other contributing items include higher performance based compensation expense; expenses associated with our business in Colombia, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2005; a one time charge of $21.0 related to the resolution of a long standing dispute regarding value added taxes in the U.K.; and additional expense of $49.2 due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, including restricted stock units granted in connection with design changes to share based compensation plans related to the adoption. These expense increases were partially offset by benefits associated with our restructuring initiatives, primarily salary and benefit savings associated with our delayering initiative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $280.6 in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to $48.1 of costs incurred to implement our restructuring initiatives, higher spending on brochures and our sales leadership program, higher pension expense, as well as the impact of higher revenue. See the Segment Review section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information related to changes in operating margin by segment. Other Expenses Interest expense increased in 2006 and 2005, mainly due to higher borrowings to support our share repurchase programs, as well as increases in domestic interest rates. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 30% and 60%, respectively, of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. Our total exposure to floating interest rates at December 31, 2006 was approximately 50%. Interest income increased in both 2006 and 2005, primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances invested offshore at higher interest rates. Other expense, net increased in 2006, primarily because 2005 included a net gain of $4.7 million on the sale of investments in equity securities and a gain of $2.5 on a treasury lock agreement that was no longer designated as a hedge. Other expense, net decreased in 2005, primarily because 2004 included write downs of $13.7 resulting from other than temporary declines in the fair values of investments in equity securities below their costs bases, as well as the gains included in 2005 discussed above. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for 2006 was 31.8%, compared to 24.0% for 2005. During 2006, the tax rate was favorably impacted by 24 approximately 4.0 points due to the closure of tax years by expiration of the statute of limitations and audit settlements as well as 1.7 points due to tax refunds. These benefits were partially offset by the repatriation of international earnings, which increased the rate by approximately 3.1 points, and the tax impact associated with our restructuring charges due to the lower weighted average effective tax rate of subsidiaries incurring the charges. The effective tax rate for 2005 was 24.0%, primarily due to the favorable effects of the completion of tax examinations, as well as the closure of a tax year by expiration of the statute of limitations, which reduced the effective tax rate by approximately 10.5 points. SEGMENT REVIEW Below is an analysis of the key factors affecting revenue and operating profit by reportable segment for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2006.

Certain planned global expenses are allocated to our business segments primarily based on planned revenue. The unallocated costs remain as global and other expenses. We do not allocate costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to our global functions to our segments. Costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to a specific segment are recorded within that segment. 2006 2005 % Change 2005 2004 % Change Total Global expenses $ 463.6 $ 320.8 (45 )% $ 320.8 $ 325.9 2 % Allocated to segments (308.8 ) (227.8 ) 36 % (227.8 ) (236.5 ) (4 )% Net Global expenses $ 154.8 $ 93.0 (66 )% $ 93.0 $ 89.4 (4 )% The increase in the amounts allocated to the segments in 2006 was primarily due to higher share based compensation expense due to our adoption of FAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, as well as higher performance based compensation expense. The increase in net global expenses was primarily due to incremental costs of $42.4 to implement restructuring initiatives, as well as higher than planned performance based compensation expense. Net global expenses increased in 2005, primarily due to costs to implement restructuring initiatives, partially offset by lower expense for performance based compensation plans. 25 North America 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 2,554.0 $ 2,510.5 2 % 1 % Operating profit 181.6 282.8 (36 )% (36 )% Operating margin 7.1 % 11.3 % (4.2 ) (4.2 ) Units sold (4 )% Active Representatives (3 )% Total revenue increased 2% in 2006, as the larger average order received from Representatives more than offset a decline in Active Representatives. Revenue in 2006 benefited from new product launches, supported by significant advertising. The increase in average order was driven by strong sales of products in the Beauty Plus category, which has a higher price point. The primary contributor to the decline in Active Representatives was a decrease in the number of orders placed. While Active Representatives declined overall for 2006, we noted an improvement in the second half of the year, turning to slight growth in the fourth quarter. We believe this improvement was primarily driven by a variety of Representative value enhancing initiatives we implemented during the second half of 2006 in our U.S. business designed to increase Representative ordering activity, combined with our increased consumer investments and some easing in the negative impact from higher fuel prices. In the U.S., these Representative value enhancing initiatives included re indexing of certain earnings thresholds in our Sales Leadership program, distributing bonus brochures to higher performing Representatives and strengthening sales incentives. We expect this improvement to continue as we implement our Representative Value Proposition. The decrease in 2006 operating margin in North America was primarily driven by incremental costs to implement restructuring initiatives, including costs associated with our decision to realign North America distribution operations, delayering and the closure of the Avon Salon & Spa. These incremental costs negatively impacted operating margin by 2.2 points. The decrease in operating margin was also due to substantially higher spending on advertising, higher performance based compensation expenses, higher allocation of global expenses, and incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives, partially offset by expense reduction efforts. North America 2005 Compared to 2004 %/Point Change 2005 2004 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 2,510.5 $ 2,632.3 (5 )% (5 )% Operating profit 282.8 331.9 (15 )% (16 )% Operating margin 11.3 % 12.6 % (1.3 ) (1.4 ) Units sold (6 )% Active Representatives (3 )% Total revenue declined in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 7% decline in Beauty sales. The decline in Beauty sales was due to decreases in units sold and Active Representatives, reflecting lower customer purchase frequency and ongoing competitive intensity. Beauty Plus sales increased 9% and Beyond Beauty sales decreased 14%, partially reflecting the shift in product mix in these two categories which occurred as part of our planned repositioning strategy. Beauty Plus sales increased primarily due to the national roll out of an intimate apparel line, during 2005, in the U.S. During 2005, the U.S. business exited the toy category, which was part of Beyond Beauty and which contributed to decreased sales in this category. North American operating margin declined primarily due to declines in the U.S., reflecting the unfavorable impacts of pricing and product mix, including the roll out of the intimate apparel line. Additionally, operating margin was negatively impacted by lower revenue combined with costs to implement restructuring initiatives, primarily delayering and the exit of the beComing product line in the U.S. Latin America 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 2,743.4 $ 2,272.6 21 % 17 % Operating profit 424.0 453.2 (6 )% (10 )% Operating margin 15.5 % 19.9 % (4.4 ) (4.5 ) Units sold 8 % Active Representatives 11 % Total revenue increased in 2006, reflecting growth in Active Representatives and units sold, as well as favorable foreign exchange, primarily in Brazil. The region benefited from the fourth quarter 2005 acquisition of our licensee in Colombia, as that market contributed 8 points to the regions revenue growth. The region benefited from continued strength in Brazil, where 26 revenues increased 32% due to larger average order and increased Active Representatives, reflecting new product launches supported by significant advertising and promotional activities. The increase in revenue in Brazil and the acquisition and growth of Colombia more than compensated for continued declines in Mexico, where revenues decreased 6%, mainly due to a decline in Active Representatives. The decline in Active Representatives reflected, in part, challenges related to field execution caused by a change in the attractiveness of incentives, including ineffective performance management for our zone managers. In 2006, we have commenced a number of initiatives to improve performance in Mexico, including an upgrade of field talent and investments in incentives and motivation programs, and we may see improvement by the end of 2007, as we continue to increase advertising and focus on field execution through the Representative Value Proposition. We also plan to continue to focus on our supply chain transition in Mexico. The decrease in operating margin in Latin America during 2006 was most significantly impacted by increased spending on advertising, incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives, higher allocation of global expenses, and a 2005 gain on the sale of property in Mexico, partially offset by operating efficiencies due to the revenue increase. Additionally, incremental costs to implement our restructuring initiatives negatively impacted operating margin by 1.1 points. Currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government in 2003 have become more restrictive and have further impacted the ability of our subsidiary in Venezuela (Avon Venezuela) to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products. As a result of this increased difficulty, during 2006, Avon Venezuela purchased approximately $17.6 in the parallel market that resulted in a foreign exchange loss of $4.5. Unless official foreign exchange is made more readily available, Avon Venezuelas operations will continue to be negatively impacted as it will need to obtain more of its foreign currency needs from the parallel market. At December 31, 2006, Avon Venezuela had cash balances of approximately $76.0, primarily denominated in bolivars. During the year, Avon Venezuela remitted dividends of $26.2 at the official exchange rate. As a result, we continue to use the official rate to translate the financial statements of Avon Venezuela into U.S. dollars. In 2006, Avon Venezuelas revenue and operating profit represented approximately 3% and 7% of consolidated revenue and consolidated operating profit, respectively. Latin America 2005 Compared to 2004 %/Point Change 2005 2004 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 2,272.6 $ 1,934.6 17 % 10 % Operating profit 453.2 420.7 8 % % Operating margin 19.9 % 21.7 % (1.8 ) (1.9 ) Units sold 8 % Active Representatives 11 % Total revenue increased in 2005 with increases in all markets in the region, except Mexico, reflecting growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. The purchase of our licensee in Colombia favorably impacted Latin Americas revenue and Active Representative growth by 2%. Revenue grew significantly in Brazil, primarily due to growth in units sold and Active Representatives, incremental consumer and field incentive programs, as well as favorable foreign exchange. The revenue decline in Mexico reflected increased competitive intensity and a significant decline in non Beauty product offerings, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Operating margin declined in Latin America during 2005, mainly affected by increased fixed expenses, primarily salaries, costs to implement restructuring initiatives, unfavorable product mix, pricing investments and incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives, partially offset by benefits from supply chain efficiencies and a gain on the sale of property in Mexico. Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,123.7 $ 1,065.1 6 % 6 % Operating profit (17.8 ) 63.7 * * Operating margin (1.6 )% 6.0 % (7.6 ) (7.5 ) Units sold 3 % Active Representatives 2 % * Calculation not meaningful Total revenue increased reflecting growth in Active Representatives and units, with increases in revenues in most markets in the region, most significantly in Turkey and the U.K. Revenue growth of 23% in Turkey benefited from the continued strength of recruiting and field programs, as well as investments in advertising driving increased order size. Revenue in the U.K increased 27 3%, reflecting strong Beauty growth driven by successful new product launches and increased advertising. Incremental costs, during 2006, associated with implementing restructuring initiatives, primarily costs related to delayering, drove the operating margin decline, and negatively impacted segment operating margin 3.0 points in 2006. Other contributing items include $21.0 of expense associated with the resolution of a value added tax dispute in the U.K in the third quarter of 2006; incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives; unfavorable foreign exchange on imported inventory in Turkey; spending on advertising; higher allocation of global expenses; and costs related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. These unfavorable year over year comparisons were partially offset by the impact of higher revenue and benefits associated with restructuring initiatives, primarily compensation related savings associated with our delayering initiative. Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 2005 Compared to 2004 %/Point Change 2005 2004 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,065.1 $ 1,035.5 3 % 3 % Operating profit 63.7 101.7 (37 )% (37 )% Operating margin 6.0 % 9.8 % (3.8 ) (3.8 ) Units sold 4 % Active Representatives 5 % Total revenue increased in 2005 reflecting growth in Active Representatives and units sold, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Turkey continued to grow revenues, driven by high growth in both Active Representatives and units sold. Revenue decreased in the U.K. due to a smaller average order per Active Representative, reflecting an economy adversely impacted by higher interest rates, rising fuel costs and lower disposable income, as well as increased competition. Operating margin declined due to unfavorable pricing and product mix, higher manufacturing overhead, costs associated with planning and developing an enterprise resource planning system, and costs to implement restructuring initiatives. Operating margin during 2005 also suffered from investment in overhead and expenses to support an expectation of growth that did not materialize. Central & Eastern Europe 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,320.2 $ 1,226.3 8 % 4 % Operating profit 296.7 331.7 (11 )% (14 )% Operating margin 22.5 % 27.1 % (4.6 ) (4.8 ) Units sold (1 )% Active Representatives 10 % Total revenue increased in 2006 reflecting growth in Active Representatives and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower average order. Revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in Russia due to strong Active Representative growth and increased advertising, partially offset by a decline in other countries, principally Poland. This decline was mainly due to underperformance in color cosmetics during the first three quarters of 2006, primarily as a result of ineffective merchandising. The declines were also due to increased competition in Beauty. Color cosmetics sales grew during the fourth quarter, including in Poland, following changes made to color merchandising and increased advertising. Operating margin was negatively impacted by higher spending for advertising, higher allocation of global expenses and incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives. Central & Eastern Europe 2005 Compared to 2004 %/Point Change 2005 2004 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,226.3 $ 1,066.7 15 % 10 % Operating profit 331.7 307.0 8 % 3 % Operating margin 27.1 % 28.8 % (1.7 ) (2.0 ) Units sold 6 % Active Representatives 11 % Total revenue increased in 2005 reflecting favorable foreign exchange and growth in Active Representatives. Revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in Russia of 17%, reflecting growth in Active Representatives. Growth rates decelerated in 28 Central and Eastern Europe as the scale of the markets and competitive intensity increased. Operating margin declined in 2005, primarily due to unfavorable pricing and product mix, higher manufacturing overhead and adverse foreign exchange movements. Operating margin also suffered from investment in overhead and expenses to support an expectation of growth that did not materialize. Asia Pacific 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 810.8 $ 868.6 (7 )% (6 )% Operating profit 42.5 102.9 (59 )% (59 )% Operating margin 5.2 % 11.8 % (6.6 ) (6.6 ) Units sold (9 )% Active Representatives (10 )% The regions revenue decline during 2006 was primarily attributable to decreases in units sold and Active Representatives, reflecting continued declines in these measures in Japan, as well as the closing of our Indonesian operations in early 2006. Japans revenue declined 21%, driven by declines in the direct mail business, reflecting the ongoing rebalancing of our efforts between direct selling fundamentals and the number of direct mailings. While revenue declined in Japan during 2006, the decline in the second half was to a lesser extent than in the first half, as the business responded to actions we took to improve Representative economics, as well as a decision to restore some direct mailings. While our business in Japan has responded positively to our early actions, our long term objective continues to be to stabilize this business. Asia Pacific operating margin declined, primarily due to incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives, lower revenue, higher allocation of global expenses, spending on advertising, and higher product costs (principally in Japan). Additionally, incremental expenses during 2006 for costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which decreased segment margin by .7 points, contributed to the operating margin decline. Asia Pacific 2005 Compared to 2004 %/Point Change 2005 2004 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 868.6 $ 855.7 2 % 1 % Operating profit 102.9 121.9 (16 )% (17 )% Operating margin 11.8 % 14.2 % (2.4 ) (2.5 ) Units sold (1 )% Active Representatives 2 % Total revenue increased driven by increases in nearly all markets in Asia, except Japan where revenue declined due to a decrease in Active Representatives. The deceleration of Active Representative growth was primarily driven by Japan, partially offset by growth in Active Representatives in the Philippines partially due to an increase in the number of sales campaigns in the Philippines beginning in the second quarter of 2004, which increased the Active Representative growth in the region by 2%. Asia Pacific operating margin declined, primarily due to costs to implement restructuring initiatives, mainly for the closure of our operations in Indonesia, (which decreased segment margin by 2.1 points). China 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 211.8 $ 206.5 3 % % Operating profit (10.8 ) 7.7 * * Operating margin (5.1 )% 3.8 % (8.9 ) (9.1 ) Units sold 1 % Active Representatives * * Calculation not meaningful Our business in China continues to evolve with the opening of direct selling. In late February 2006, Avon received the first national license to commence direct selling under directives issued by the Chinese government in late 2005. Since then, we have been actively recruiting a direct selling force, called Sales Promoters, throughout the country. These Sales Promoters must be trained and certified according to government regulations. As of December 31, 2006, we had over 350,000 certified Sales Promoters, approximately 150,000 of whom fit our standard definition of Active Representatives. We have been and continue to be engaged in comprehensive training of these Sales Promoters to help them build their business by developing their customer base and product knowledge. In 2007, we plan to 29 initiate a removal program, consistent with removal programs in our other markets, to eliminate inactive certified Sales Promoters after a period of time. Since we received our license, other companies have received direct selling licenses, with two large multi national competitors receiving regional licenses in late 2006. Prior to the reopening of direct selling we had sold our products in China through a network of licensed beauty boutiques, as well as dealer owned and company owned store counters. The company owned store counters were exited as part of our restructuring initiatives. In addition to being a retail boutique, a beauty boutique can now participate in direct selling by operating as a service center to the Sales Promoters, an essential element of the direct selling model stipulated in the Direct Selling regulations, for which they can earn service fees from Avon. Chinas revenue is now generated through Sales Promoters, beauty boutiques and dealer owned counters. Total revenue increased in 2006, as significant growth in direct selling more than offset the lower revenue from beauty boutiques, as they reduced their order sizes in connection with the resumption of direct selling, as well as the unfavorable impact of the exit of company owned counters, which had a negative nine point impact on 2006 revenue growth. Total revenue in 2006 also benefited from the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Due to the significant growth of direct selling since our March 2006 launch, direct selling is becoming a greater portion of our business and is expected to continue as it is built up. At the same time that we have been building on direct selling, we have stabilized our beauty boutiques. During 2006, we have not experienced a significant decline in the number of beauty boutiques, and we ended 2006 with a similar number of active beauty boutiques as compared to the beginning of 2006. The operating margin decrease was primarily driven by significantly higher spending on advertising, fees paid to registered service centers for providing services to our Active Representatives, and other costs associated with the launch of direct selling. China 2005 Compared to 2004 %/Point Change 2005 2004 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 206.5 $ 223.0 (7 )% (8 )% Operating profit 7.7 35.2 (78 )% (78 )% Operating margin 3.8 % 15.8 % (12.0 ) (12.0 ) Units sold (3 )% Active Representatives * * Calculation not meaningful Revenue in China declined 7% as the beauty boutique owners reduced the size of their orders as compared to the prior year in connection with the anticipated resumption of direct selling discussed above. Operating margin decreased driven by incremental costs to prepare for direct selling and the cost of maintaining our consumer investment, primarily through advertising, against a significantly lower revenue base. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, commercial paper and borrowings under lines of credit. We currently believe that existing cash, cash from operations (including the impacts of cash required for restructuring initiatives) and available sources of public and private financing are adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, dividends, capital expenditures, the stock repurchase program, possible acquisitions and other cash needs. Balance Sheet Data 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,198.9 $ 1,058.7 Total debt 1,786.3 1,649.0 Working capital 784.2 419.3 Cash Flows 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 796.1 $ 895.5 $ 882.6 Net cash used by investing activities (207.9 ) (343.1 ) (279.4 ) Net cash used by financing activities (490.4 ) (226.7 ) (567.0 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents 42.4 (36.6 ) 39.4 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $99.4 during 2006, primarily due to cash payments of approximately $117.0 associated with restructuring charges, and additional cash payments associated with other costs to implement restructuring initiatives. To a lesser extent, unfavorable working capital levels in inventory and accounts receivable contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities. These decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by 30 favorable working capital levels in accounts payable and lower payments associated with incentive compensation as compared to 2005. Inventory levels have continued to increase during 2006 from $801.7 at December 31, 2005 to $900.3 at December 31, 2006, reflecting an increase in inventory coverage, partially driven by decisions to protect service levels in the first quarter of 2007, higher sales volume and the impacts of foreign exchange. As previously mentioned, our turnaround plan includes initiatives such as PLS and Sales and Operations Planning process that are expected to improve inventory levels. We maintain defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans (see Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans). Our funding policy for these plans is based on legal requirements and cash flows. The amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Estimates). The future funding for these plans will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of associates electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. Based on current assumptions, we expect to contribute approximately $23.0 and $70.0 to our U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, in 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was $12.9 favorable to 2004 principally reflecting higher net income (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax audit settlement payments ($71.2 in 2004 versus $12.5 in 2005) offset by increased inventory levels. Additionally, operating cash flow was favorably impacted by the timing of accounts payable payments and unfavorably affected by higher contributions of approximately $21.0 to the U.S. and international pension plans in 2005 (approximately $162.0 in 2005 versus $141.0 in 2004) and lower accruals for performance based compensation. Net Cash Used by Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities in 2006 was $135.2 lower than in 2005 resulting from lower capital expenditures due to fewer major construction projects during 2006, and the 2005 purchase of the Avon direct selling business from our licensee in Colombia for $154.0, partially offset by the 2006 acquisition of the remaining minority interest in our two joint venture subsidiaries in China for approximately $39.1. Capital expenditures during 2006 were $174.8 compared with $206.8 in 2005. The decrease in capital spending was primarily driven by spending in 2005 for our global research and development facility, capacity expansion and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Plant construction, expansion and modernization projects were in progress at December 31, 2006, with an estimated cost to complete of approximately $76.4. Capital expenditures in 2007 are currently expected to be in the range of $275.0 to $325.0 and will be funded by cash from operations. These expenditures will include investments for capacity expansion, the construction of a new distribution facility in North America and information systems (including the continued development of the ERP system). Net cash used by investing activities in 2005 was $63.7 higher than in 2004 resulting primarily from the 2005 purchase of the Avon direct selling business from our licensee in Colombia for $154.0, partially offset by the 2004 purchase of a portion of the ownership interest in our subsidiary in China for $45.6 and lower capital expenditures. Capital expenditures during 2005 were $206.8 compared with $250.1 in 2004. The decrease in capital spending was primarily driven by investments in 2004 for a new manufacturing facility in Russia and the construction of a global research and development facility, partially offset by spending in 2005 for an ERP system. Net Cash Used by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities in 2006 was $263.7 higher than in 2005, mainly driven by higher borrowings during 2005 and lower proceeds from stock option exercises during 2006, partially offset by lower repurchases of common stock during 2006. Net cash used by financing activities in 2005 was $340.3 lower than in 2004, mainly driven by higher commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by higher repurchases of common stock, lower proceeds from stock option exercises, and higher dividend payments. We purchased approximately 11.6 million shares of Avon common stock for $355.1 during 2006, as compared to approximately 22.9 million shares of Avon common stock for $728.0 during 2005 and approximately 5.7 million shares of Avon common stock for $224.2 during 2004, under our previously announced share repurchase programs and through acquisition of stock from employees in connection with tax payments upon vesting of restricted stock. During 2006, we increased sequentially the purchases under our program as we have been accelerating the pace of our repurchase program. Dividends of $.70 per share were declared and paid in 2006, as compared to $.66 per share in 2005 and $.56 per share in 2004. In February 2007, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $.185 per share. 31 Debt and Contractual Financial Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2006, our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and Beyond Total Short term debt $ 610.7 $ $ $ $ $ $ 610.7 Long term debt 14.2 300.0 500.0 375.0 1,189.2 Capital lease obligations 4.9 3.7 3.1 .1 11.8 Total debt 615.6 17.9 303.1 .1 500.0 375.0 1,811.7 Debt related interest 69.9 63.4 63.4 41.9 41.9 85.1 365.6 Total debt related 685.5 81.3 366.5 42.0 541.9 460.1 2,177.3 Operating leases 86.3 68.9 52.7 35.2 31.0 66.8 340.9 Purchase obligations 222.9 87.5 62.0 47.9 16.3 79.4 516.0 Benefit obligations (2) 24.4 1.7 1.7 1.7 2.0 14.7 46.2 Total debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments (1) $ 1,019.1 $ 239.4 $ 482.9 $ 126.8 $ 591.2 $ 621.0 $ 3,080.4 (1) The amount of debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments excludes amounts due pursuant to derivative transactions. The table also excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding, are generally consistent from year to year, and are short term in nature. (2) Amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as expected contributions for 2007 to our funded pension benefit plans. See Note 4, Debt and Other Financing, and Note 12, Leases and Commitments, for further information on our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 13, Restructuring Initiatives, we have a remaining liability of $86.0 associated with the restructuring charges recorded to date, and we also expect to record additional restructuring expenses of $9.6 in future periods to implement the actions for which charges were recorded during 2006. The significant majority of these liabilities will require cash payments during 2007. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements. Capital Resources Total debt at December 31, 2006 increased $137.3 to $1,786.3 from $1,649.0 at December 31, 2005, primarily due to the $500.0 principal amount of notes payable issued in January 2006 (see Note 4, Debt and Other Financing), partially offset by lower commercial paper borrowings. We have a five year, $1,000.0 revolving credit and competitive advance facility (the credit facility), which expires in January 2011. The credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. The interest rate on borrowings under the new credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime or 1/2% plus the federal funds rate. The credit facility has an annual fee of $.675, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains various covenants, including a financial covenant which requires Avons interest coverage ratio (determined in relation to our consolidated pretax income and interest expense) to equal or exceed 4:1. The credit facility also provides for a possible extension of the term by up to two years and possible increases by up to an aggregate incremental principal amount of $250.0, subject to the consent of the affected lenders under the credit facility. At December 31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. We have a $1,000.0 commercial paper program. Under this program, we may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws, for a cumulative face amount not to exceed $1,000.0 outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment. The commercial paper program is supported by our credit facility. Outstanding commercial paper effectively reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we had commercial paper outstanding of $335.9. 32 In August 2006, we entered into a one year Japanese yen 11.0 billion ($92.9 at the exchange rate on December 31, 2006) uncommitted credit facility (yen credit facility) with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. Borrowings under the yen credit facility bear interest at the yen LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The yen credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. The yen credit facility was used to repay the Japanese yen 9.0 billion note which came due in September 2006, as well as for other general corporate purposes. The yen credit facility is designated as a hedge of our net investment in our Japanese subsidiary. At December 31, 2006, $92.9 (Japanese yen 11.0 billion) was outstanding under the yen credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants in our indentures (see Note 4, Debt and Other Financing). Such indentures do not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities. We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means. Since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and forecasted transactions, we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives. The master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in certain circumstances, including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of Avon prior to the merger. Interest Rate Risk Our long term, fixed rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. We use interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the fixed rate on the debt to a floating interest rate, to manage our interest rate exposure. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 30% and 60%, respectively, of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. Avons total exposure to floating interest rates at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was approximately 50% and 80%, respectively. Our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 50 basis point change (either an increase or a decrease) in interest rates prevailing at that date, sustained for one year, would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt. Foreign Currency Risk We operate globally, with operations in various locations around the world. Over the past three years, approximately 65% to 75% of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. The functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency. We are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations, primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities. At December 31, 2006, the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Colombian peso, the Euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Venezuelan bolivar. We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to, and, therefore, cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. Based on our foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2006, the impact of a 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. The hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using 33 forward rates at December 31, 2006, adjusted for an assumed 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these hedging contracts. Credit Risk of Financial Instruments We attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements only with major international financial institutions with "A" or higher credit ratings as issued by Standard & Poors Corporation. Our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts, swaps or options with major international financial institutions. Although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments, we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses, if any, would not be material. Non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a net write off of $2.2 at December 31, 2006. In addition, in the event of non performance by such counterparties, we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
