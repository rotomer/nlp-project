ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries (Avon or the Company) should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. When used in this discussion, the terms Avon, Company, we or us mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries. OVERVIEW We are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Our business is conducted worldwide, primarily in the direct selling channel. We presently have sales operations in approximately 66 countries and territories, including the U.S., and distribute products in approximately 48 more. Our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in six regions: North America; Latin America; Western Europe, Middle East & Africa; Central & Eastern Europe; Asia Pacific; and China. We centrally manage global Brand Marketing and Supply Chain organizations. Product categories consist of: Beauty, which consists of cosmetics, fragrances, skin care and toiletries; Beauty Plus, which consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel and accessories; and Beyond Beauty, which consists of home products and gift and decorative products. Sales from Health and Wellness products and mark., a global cosmetics brand that focuses on the market for young women, are included among these categories based on product type. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through approximately 5.4 million independent Representatives, who are independent contractors and not employees of Avon. The success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting, motivating and retaining Representatives. We view the geographic diversity of our businesses as a strategic advantage. In developed markets, such as the U.S., we seek to achieve growth in line with that of the overall beauty market, while in developing and emerging markets we seek to achieve higher growth targets. Revenue grew in every segment during 2007. We continued to experience strong growth in emerging and developing markets, including Brazil, China, Colombia, Russia, Turkey and Venezuela. We have also experienced growth in developed markets, such as the U.S. and the U.K. Revenue in China increased significantly due to the continued roll out of direct selling. See the Segment Review section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment. In 2005, we launched a comprehensive multi year turnaround plan, described below, which seeks to take costs out of our business and reinvest those savings in initiatives that we expect to generate revenues as well as increase profitability over the long run. As part of this turnaround plan, we invested ahead of savings and incurred incremental costs, including investments in advertising and the Representative Value Proposition (RVP), as well as costs to implement restructuring and costs related to our product line simplification (PLS) program. Operating margins for the years 2007 and 2006 were negatively impacted by these costs associated with our turnaround plan. Strategic Initiatives In November 2005, we launched a comprehensive, multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth. Our four point turnaround plan includes: Committing to brand competitiveness by focusing research and development resources on product innovation and by increasing our advertising; Winning with commercial edge by more effectively utilizing pricing and promotion, expanding our Sales Leadership program and improving the attractiveness of our Representative earnings opportunity as needed; Elevating organizational effectiveness by redesigning our structure to eliminate layers of management in order to take full advantage of our global scale and size; and Transforming the cost structure so that our costs are aligned to our revenue growth and remain so. Our turnaround plan has continued to gain traction and deliver results. During 2007, revenues increased 13%, Active Representatives increased 9%, with increases in all segments, and sales from each of our product categories increased, with products in the Beauty category increasing 15%, fueled by higher investments in advertising and RVP and benefiting from a shift in research and development investment to innovation. Beauty sales have also benefited from a modest improvement in both the frequency and depth of discounting. The advertising and RVP investments were substantially funded by savings from restructuring initiatives and other cost savings initiatives. 17 Table of Contents In our ongoing effort to improve brand competitiveness, we increased our investment in advertising by 83% in 2006 and 48% in 2007. Advertising investments were $368.4, $248.9 and $135.9 during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 60% of the incremental spending was allocated to China, Brazil, Russia and the U.S. The advertising investments supported new product launches, such as Anew Ultimate Age Repair Night Cream and Elixir, Christian Lacroix fragrances, Imari Seduction and Avon Color cosmetics, including Uplifting Mascara, and Ultra Color Rich Lipstick, as well as support for Hello Tomorrow, Avons first global, integrated marketing campaign, supporting both the brand and direct selling channel. Advertising investments also included advertising to recruit Representatives. Representative Value Proposition As part of the RVP, we also continued to invest in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our Representatives. We have allocated significant investments in proprietary direct selling analytics to better understand the drivers of value for our Representatives. We measure our investment in RVP as the incremental cost to provide these value enhancing initiatives. In 2007, we invested approximately $121 incrementally to enhance RVP through continued implementation of our Sales Leadership program, increased incentives spending, web enablement, improved commissions, and the launch of more frequent selling opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe. Investing in RVP will continue to be a key strategy. Product Line Simplification During 2006, we began to analyze our product line, under our PLS program, to develop a smaller range of better performing, more profitable products. The overall goal of PLS is to identify an improved product assortment to drive higher sales of more profitable products. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed the analysis of our product portfolio, concluded on the appropriate product assortment going forward and made decisions regarding the ultimate disposition of products that will no longer be part of our improved product assortment (such as selling at a discount, donation, or destruction). As a result of these decisions, we recorded costs during the fourth quarter of 2007 of $103.7 related to our PLS program, which includes incremental inventory obsolescence expense of $99.2. We incurred costs of $187.8 related to our PLS program for full year 2007, which includes incremental inventory obsolescence expense of $167.3. We have incurred total PLS costs of $269.2 ($187.8 in 2007 and $81.4 in 2006). There will be no further PLS inventory charges. See the Provisions for Inventory Obsolescence section of MD&A on page 22 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. We expect that sales and marketing benefits will account for approximately 85% of our projected benefits. Improving our product assortment will allow us to increase exposure and improve presentation of the remaining products within our brochure, which is expected to yield more pleasurable consumer shopping experiences, easier Representative selling experiences, and greater sales per brochure page. A second source of benefits from PLS results from transferable demand. Transferable demand refers to the concept that when products with redundant characteristics are removed from our product assortment, some demand from the eliminated products will transfer to the remaining products that offer similar or comparable product characteristics. As part of PLS, when we identify products that have sufficient overlap of characteristics, we will eliminate the products with the lowest profitability and we expect the products that we retain will generate more profit. A third source of benefits from PLS is less price discounting. As we implement operating procedures under PLS, we anticipate introducing fewer new products and lengthening the lifecycle of products in our offering, which we expect will lead to less aggressive price discounting over a products life cycle. In addition to the benefits above, we also expect supply chain benefits to account for approximately 15% of our projected benefits. We expect improvements to cost of sales once PLS is fully implemented, primarily from a reduction in inventory obsolescence expense as a result of better managed inventory levels, lower variable spending on warehousing, more efficient manufacturing utilization and lower purchasing costs. We also expect operating expenses to benefit from a reduction in distribution costs and benefits to inventory productivity. We expect to realize annualized benefits in excess of $200 by the end of 2009, with a full year of benefit in 2010. We expect to begin to realize initial benefits in the second half of 2008, but the benefits in 2008 are not expected to be large. Annualized benefits, or annualized savings, mean the additional operating profit we expect to realize on a full year basis every year following full implementation of the respective initiative as compared with the operating profit we would have expected to achieve without having implemented the initiative. We expect to realize benefits of approximately $40 and $120 in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and in excess of $200 in 2010. Strategic Sourcing Initiative In March 2007, we launched SSI. This initiative is expected to reduce direct and indirect costs of materials, goods and services. Under this initiative, we are shifting our purchasing strategy from a local, commodity oriented approach towards a globally coordinated effort which leverages our volumes, allows our suppliers to benefit from economies of scale, utilizes sourcing best practices and processes, and better matches our suppliers capabilities with our needs. Beyond lower costs, our goals from SSI include improving asset management, service for Representatives and vendor relationships. During 2007, we completed an analysis, based on 2006 data, which identified approximately $4,000 of spending to be targeted for cost reductions. Additionally, during 2007, we implemented the first of three waves of this initiative, which has addressed approximately 38% of the identified spending and is expected to generate approximately 45% of the expected benefits. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we launched the second wave of this initiative, which is expected to address 45% of the identified spending and generate approximately 40% of the expected benefits. We realized benefits of approximately $15 from SSI during 2007. We expect to realize approximately 50% of total expected benefits by 2008, with annualized benefits from this initiative in excess of $200 by the end of 2009, with a full year of benefit in 2010. As a result, we expect to realize benefits of approximately $100 and $175 in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and in excess of $200 in 2010. 18 Table of Contents We have also begun implementation of a Sales and Operating Planning process that is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues. Zero Overhead Growth We have institutionalized a zero overhead growth philosophy that aims to offset inflation through productivity improvements. These improvements in productivity will come primarily from SSI and our restructuring initiatives. We have defined overhead as fixed expenses such as costs associated with our sales and marketing infrastructure, and management and administrative activities. Overhead excludes variable expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses, such as shipping and handling costs and bonuses to our employees in the sales organization, and also excludes consumer and strategic investments that are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, such as advertising, RVP, research and development and brochure costs. While overhead expenses increased slightly during 2007, the increase was due to the negative impact of foreign exchange. Restructuring Initiatives In connection with our four point turnaround plan, in November 2005, we announced a multi year restructuring plan, under which we expected to incur total restructuring charges and other costs to implement our restructuring initiatives in the range of $500 before taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced the final initiatives that are part of our restructuring plan. We now expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement our restructuring initiatives of approximately $530 before taxes. We have recorded total costs to implement, net of adjustments, of $443.6 ($158.3 in 2007, $228.8 in 2006 and $56.5 in 2005) for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the plan, primarily for employee related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits, and professional service fees related to these initiatives. We expect to record a majority of the remaining costs by the end of 2009, approximately $70 and $20 in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We expect our restructuring initiatives to deliver annualized savings of approximately $430 once all initiatives are fully implemented by 2011 2012, compared to our original estimate of in excess of $300. We expect the savings to reach approximately $300 by 2009. The actions implemented to date resulted in savings of approximately $230 in 2007, most of which were associated with the delayering program that we completed in 2006, as compared to savings of approximately $100 in 2006. The costs to implement restructuring initiatives during 2005 through 2007 are associated with specific actions, including: organization realignment and downsizing in each region and global through a process called delayering, taking out layers to bring senior management closer to operations; the phased outsourcing of certain services, including certain finance, information technology, human resource and customer service processes, and the move of certain services from markets to lower cost shared service centers; the restructure of certain international direct selling operations; the realignment of certain distribution and manufacturing operations, including the realignment of certain of our North America and Latin America distribution operations; the automation of certain distribution processes; the exit of certain unprofitable operations, including the closure of the Avon Salon & Spa, the closure of our operations in Indonesia, the exit of a product line in China and the exit of the beComing product line in the U.S.; and the reorganization of certain functions, primarily sales related organizations. See Note 13, Restructuring Initiatives, on pages F 34 through F 37 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. OUTLOOK We expect that our investments in both the brand and the direct selling channel will drive sustainable growth. We expect revenue growth to average mid single digits over the long term. While our operating margin during 2006 and 2007 has been impacted by the costs associated with our turnaround plan, we expect our operating margin to be impacted to a much lesser degree in 2008 by these costs. We expect our incremental investments in advertising in 2008 to be more in line with revenue growth and incremental investments in RVP to be slightly ahead of revenue growth. While full year operating margin improved slightly in 2007 to 8.8% from 2006s level of 8.7%, it is expected to approach 2005s level, or approximately 14%, in 2008, due to the projected benefits from and decreased cost related to PLS, other gross margin improvements, projected benefits from 19 Table of Contents SSI, and projected savings from and decreased costs to implement restructuring. We expect a larger proportion of the benefits from PLS and SSI and savings from restructuring to be realized in the second half of the year. As revenues grow and the savings from restructuring and benefits from PLS and SSI are realized, and we continue to apply a zero overhead growth philosophy, operating margin is expected to further expand beginning in 2009. We saw a decelerating trend in our North American segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007, consistent with the general retail environment. This decelerating trend continued into the first quarter of 2008. The revenue trend in our North America segment has been heavily influenced by weakness in our non Beauty business. Our broad based geographic portfolio gives us confidence that we can weather macroeconomic pressures and achieve our company wide revenue and operating margin targets for full year 2008. As described above, in January 2008, we announced the final initiatives of the restructuring program under our turnaround plan. We also announced that we have completed our analysis of our optimal product portfolio and made decisions on exit strategies for non optimal products under our PLS program. As we continue to move through our turnaround plan, driving revenue growth and restoring margin growth are our key priorities, with an emphasis on SSI and our philosophy of zero overhead growth. However, since our turnaround plan is a multi year effort, we still may see some quarterly variability as we move through the turnaround due to the timing of advertising and product launches. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New Accounting Standards Implemented Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN 48). As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized an $18.3 increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties), which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. (See Note 6, Income Taxes). Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R, (SFAS 158). The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a decrease to our shareholders equity by $254.7, on an after tax basis, a decrease to other assets of $232.8, an increase in accrued compensation of $35.5 and a decrease in employee benefit plans liability of $13.4. The adoption of SFAS 158 had no impact on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. (See Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans). Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant. The impact from the adoption of SFAS 123R during 2006, including restricted stock units granted in connection with design changes to share based compensation plans related to the adoption, decreased income before taxes and minority interest, net income, basic and diluted earnings per share, and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, by $49.2, $32.4, $.07 and $8.1 respectively, while it increased net cash provided by financing activities by $8.1. (See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Share Based Compensation Plans and Other Long Term Incentive Plan). New Accounting Standards to be Implemented In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R), which changes how business combinations are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS 141R is effective January 1, 2009, for Avon and will be applied prospectively. The impact of adopting SFAS 141R will depend on the nature and terms of future acquisitions. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, (SFAS 160), which changes the accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 recharacterizes minority interests as noncontrolling interests and requires noncontrolling interests to be classified as a component of shareholders equity. SFAS 160 is effective January 1, 2009 for Avon and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, other liabilities included minority interest liabilities of $38.2 and $37.0, respectively. 20 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115, (SFAS 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective January 1, 2008 for Avon. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 157 b, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until January 1, 2009, for Avon. We believe the adoption of SFAS 159 will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective January 1, 2008 for Avon. We believe the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Within the following discussion and analysis, we utilize the key performance indicators (KPIs) defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business. KPI Definition Growth in Active Representatives This indicator is based on the number of Representatives submitting an order in a campaign, totaled for all campaigns in the related period. This amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period, to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days (for example, holiday schedules). To determine the growth in Active Representatives, this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year. Change in Units This indicator is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period, as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year. Units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product (for example, gift with purchase or purchase with purchase), but exclude free samples. Inventory Days This indicator is equal to the number of days of historical cost of sales covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies. Restructuring Reserves We record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Post Employment Benefits for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement. One time, involuntary benefit arrangements and disposal costs, primarily contract termination costs, are accounted for under the provisions of FAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. One time, voluntary benefit arrangements are accounted for under the provisions of FAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. We evaluate impairment issues under the provisions of FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. We estimate the expense for these initiatives, when approved by the appropriate corporate authority, by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans. These expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits, impairment of property, plant and equipment, contract termination payments for leases, and any other qualifying exit costs. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel. Such costs represent managements best estimate, but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time, including attrition rates. Estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if and adjustment is required. 21 Table of Contents Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable Representatives contact their customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the U.S. and a two to four week duration outside the U.S. The Representative purchases products directly from Avon and may or may not sell them to an end user. In general, the Representative, an independent contractor, remits a payment to Avon each sales campaign, which relates to the prior campaign cycle. The Representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid; however, there are circumstances where the Representative fails to make the required payment. We record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances. Over the past three years, annual bad debt expense has been in the range of $136 to $164, or approximately 1.7% of total revenue. We generally have no detailed information concerning, or any communication with, any end user of our products beyond the Representative. We have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectability of any accounts receivable balances due from the Representative to us. If the financial condition of our Representatives were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Allowances for Sales Returns We record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. Over the past three years, sales returns have been in the range of $289 to $338, or approximately 3.4% of total revenue. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies, or for other reasons, additional allowances may be required. Provisions for Inventory Obsolescence We record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. In determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence, we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision. If actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence. Annual obsolescence expense was $280.6, $179.7 and $93.3 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As discussed in the Overview section, 2007 and 2006 include inventory obsolescence charges of $167.3 and $72.6, respectively, related to our PLS program and 2006 also includes $20.5 related to our decision to discontinue the sale of heavily discounted excess products. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Expense We maintain defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Additionally, we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for certain current and retired executives (see Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans). Our calculations of pension, postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent upon the use of assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, interest cost, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, mortality rates, the number of associate retirements, the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 31, 2007, we had pretax actuarial losses of $325.2 and $177.7 for the U.S. and non U.S. plans, respectively, that have not yet been charged to expense. These actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity in accordance with SFAS 158, which was adopted December 31, 2006. While we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension, postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense. For 2007, the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets, including the U.S. and non U.S. plans was 7.5%. In determining the long term rates of return, we consider the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies, historical rates of return and current economic forecasts. We evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary. The majority of our pension plan assets relate to the U.S. pension plan. The assumed rate of return for 2007 for the U.S. plan was 8.0%, which was based on an asset allocation of approximately 33% in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities (which are expected to earn approximately 5% to 7% in the long term) and 67% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 8% to 10% in the long term). Historical rates of return on the assets of the U.S. plan for the most recent 10 year and 20 year periods were 6.62% and 9.91%, respectively. In the U.S. plan, our asset allocation policy has favored U.S. equity securities, which have returned 5.8% and 11.97%, respectively, over the 10 year and 20 year periods. The actual rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. was 9.3% and 13.1% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. 22 Table of Contents The discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rates for our more significant plans, including our U.S. plan, were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan. The weighted average discount rate for U.S. and non U.S. plans determined on this basis was 5.88% at December 31, 2007, and 5.43% at December 31, 2006. Future effects of pension plans on our operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments, investment performance and funding decisions, among other factors. However, given current assumptions (including those noted above), 2008 pension expense related to the U.S. plan is expected to decrease in the range of $2.0 to $4.0. A 50 basis point change (in either direction) in the expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases, would have had the following effect on 2007 pension expense: Increase/(Decrease)in Pension Expense 50 basispointIncrease 50 basispointDecrease Rate of return on assets $ (6.0 ) $ 6.0 Discount rate (10.0 ) 10.6 Rate of compensation increase 1.6 (1.3 ) Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future, in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made. Deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. when management concludes that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Deferred taxes are provided on earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. We file income tax returns in many jurisdictions. In 2008, a number of income tax returns are scheduled to close by statute and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed. If Avons filing positions are ultimately upheld, it is possible that the 2008 provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments. Depending on the number of filing positions ultimately upheld, the impact of the adjustments could be significant to 2008 net income. In accordance with FIN 48, we recognize the benefit of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. Share based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant. We use a Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options. This model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share based compensation may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. 23 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies In accordance with FAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable. Our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation, which, by its nature is unpredictable. We believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total Revenue Total revenue increased 13% in 2007 with growth in all segments. Revenue growth was driven by an increase of 9% in Active Representatives, while foreign exchange contributed 5 percentage points to the revenue growth. An increase in the number of sales campaigns in Central & Eastern Europe had a minimal impact on Active Representative growth. On a category basis, the 2007 increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase of 15% in Beauty sales. Within the Beauty category, fragrance increased 20%, color increased 16%, skin care increased 6% and personal care increased 21%. Beauty Plus sales increased 12% and Beyond Beauty sales increased 6%. Total revenue increased 8% in 2006, as we benefited from the fourth quarter 2005 acquisition of our licensee in Colombia, as that market contributed 3 percentage points to revenue growth. Foreign exchange also contributed 2 percentage points to the revenue growth. Revenue grew in Latin America, Western Europe, Middle East & Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, North America and China. Revenue declined in Asia Pacific. 24 Table of Contents On a category basis, the 2006 increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase of 8% in Beauty sales. Within the Beauty category, fragrance increased 12%, color increased 3%, skin care increased 6%, and personal care increased 7%. Beauty Plus sales increased 10% and Beyond Beauty sales increased 3%. For additional discussion of the changes in revenue by segment, see the Segment Review section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased .7 point in 2007, primarily due to an increase in inventory obsolescence provisions of approximately $100 in 2007 and an unfavorable mix of products sold, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. As discussed in the Overview section, 2007 and 2006 included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of $167.3 and $72.6, respectively, related to our decision to discontinue the sale of certain products as part of our PLS program. Additionally, 2006 included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of $20.5 related to our decisions to discontinue the sale of certain heavily discounted products. There will be no further PLS inventory charges. Gross margin decreased .8 point during 2006, primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence provisions, which increased $86.4 in 2006. As discussed in the Overview section, 2006 includes charges related to our PLS program and our decision to discontinue the sale of heavily discounted excess products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses during 2007 increased $538.8, primarily due to higher investments in advertising and RVP of approximately $240, higher variable expenses such as freight and commissions from increased sales volume, and increased distribution costs as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher expenses were $71.8 of lower costs incurred to implement our restructuring initiatives and savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives. Additionally, 2007 benefited from a favorable comparison to 2006 which included a one time charge of $21.0 related to the resolution of a long standing dispute regarding value added taxes in the U.K., the recognition of unclaimed sales related tax credits and a reduction of a reserve for statutory liabilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $698.6 during 2006, primarily due to $181.0 of incremental costs incurred to implement our restructuring initiatives and investments in advertising of $113.0. Other contributing items include higher performance based compensation expense; expenses associated with our business in Colombia, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2005; a one time charge of $21.0 related to the resolution of the VAT dispute, discussed above; and additional expense of $49.2 due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, including restricted stock units granted in connection with design changes to share based compensation plans related to the adoption. These expense increases were partially offset by savings associated with our restructuring initiatives, primarily salary and benefit savings associated with our delayering initiative. See the Segment Review section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information related to changes in operating margin by segment. Other Expenses Interest expense increased in 2007 and 2006, mainly due to higher borrowings to support our share repurchase programs, as well as increases in domestic interest rates. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 30% of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. Our total exposure to floating interest rates at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was approximately 60% and 50%, respectively. Interest income decreased in 2007, primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances. Interest income increased in 2006, primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances invested offshore at higher interest rates. Other expense, net decreased in 2007 primarily due to higher net foreign exchange gains in 2007. Other expense, net increased in 2006, primarily because 2005 included a net gain of $4.7 million on the sale of investments in equity securities and a gain of $2.5 on a treasury lock agreement that was no longer designated as a hedge. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for 2007 was 33.0%, compared to 31.8% for 2006. During 2007, the tax rate was favorably impacted by approximately 2.0 points due to the net release of valuation allowances, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of restructuring initiatives and PLS program and earnings mix. 25 Table of Contents During 2006, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by approximately 4.0 points due to the closure of tax years by expiration of the statute of limitations and audit settlements as well as 1.7 points due to tax refunds. These benefits were partially offset by the repatriation of international earnings, which increased the rate by approximately 3.1 points, and the tax impact associated with our restructuring charges due to the lower weighted average effective tax rate of subsidiaries incurring the charges. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 31.8%, compared to 24.0% for 2005. The effective tax rate for 2005 was favorably impacted by the completion of tax examinations, as well as the closure of a tax year by expiration of the statute of limitations, which reduced the effective tax rate by approximately 10.5 points. SEGMENT REVIEW Below is an analysis of the key factors affecting revenue and operating profit by reportable segment for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2007. 2007 2006 2005 Years ended December 31 TotalRevenue OperatingProfit TotalRevenue OperatingProfit TotalRevenue OperatingProfit North America $ 2,622.1 $ 213.1 $ 2,554.0 $ 181.6 $ 2,510.5 $ 282.8 Latin America 3,298.9 483.1 2,743.4 424.0 2,272.6 453.2 Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 1,308.6 33.9 1,123.7 (17.8 ) 1,065.1 63.7 Central & Eastern Europe 1,577.8 296.1 1,320.2 296.7 1,226.3 331.7 Asia Pacific 850.8 64.3 810.8 42.5 868.6 102.9 China 280.5 2.0 211.8 (10.8 ) 206.5 7.7 Total from operations 9,938.7 1,092.5 8,763.9 916.2 8,149.6 1,242.0 Global and other expenses (219.8 ) (154.8 ) (93.0 ) Total $ 9,938.7 $ 872.7 $ 8,763.9 $ 761.4 $ 8,149.6 $ 1,149.0 Global and other expenses include, among other things, costs related to our executive and administrative offices, information technology, research and development, and marketing. Certain planned global expenses are allocated to our business segments primarily based on planned revenue. The unallocated costs remain as global and other expenses. We do not allocate costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to our global functions to our segments. Costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to a specific segment are recorded within that segment. 2007 2006 % Change 2006 2005 % Change Total Global expenses $ 552.6 $ 463.6 (19 )% $ 463.6 $ 320.8 (45 )% Allocated to segments (332.8 ) (308.8 ) 8 % (308.8 ) (227.8 ) 36 % Net Global expenses $ 219.8 $ 154.8 (42 )% $ 154.8 $ 93.0 (66 )% The increase in the amounts allocated to the segments in 2007 was primarily due to higher global marketing costs, reflecting increased spending for market research, research and development, advertising and Hello Tomorrow. The increase in net global expenses was primarily due to higher costs related to global initiatives, higher information technology costs and higher performance based compensation expense. The increase in the amounts allocated to the segments in 2006 was primarily due to higher share based compensation expense due to our adoption of FAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, as well as higher performance based compensation expense. The increase in net global expenses was primarily due to incremental costs of $42.4 to implement restructuring initiatives, as well as higher than planned performance based compensation expense. 26 Table of Contents North America 2007 Compared to 2006 %/Point Change 2007 2006 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 2,622.1 $ 2,554.0 3 % 2 % Operating profit 213.1 181.6 17 % 15 % Operating margin 8.1 % 7.1 % 1.0 .9 Units sold 3 % Active Representatives 3 % North America consists largely of the U.S. business. Total revenue increased 3% in 2007, primarily due to growth in Active Representatives, benefiting from continued investments in RVP and recruiting advertising. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we began to see decelerating trends in non Beauty, particularly in accessories and apparel, driven by the negative impact of rising gas prices, as well as softness in the U.S. retail sector, which negatively impacted average order. This decelerating trend continued into the first quarter of 2008. The U.S. business is in the midst of a long term turnaround plan; therefore, we expect variability in our quarterly performance of North America. Quarterly performance has been and may continue to be impacted by various factors, including the impact of fuel prices and the general U.S. economy on Representatives ordering activity and timing of product launches. The increase in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which positively impacted operating margin by 1.9 points, savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives and supply chain efficiencies. These benefits to operating margin were partially offset by higher inventory obsolescence expense, higher spending on advertising and RVP, and costs related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. North America 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 2,554.0 $ 2,510.5 2 % 1 % Operating profit 181.6 282.8 (36 )% (36 )% Operating margin 7.1 % 11.3 % (4.2 ) (4.2 ) Units sold (4 )% Active Representatives (3 )% Total revenue increased 2% in 2006, as the larger average order received from Representatives more than offset a decline in Active Representatives. Revenue in 2006 benefited from new product launches, supported by significant advertising. The increase in average order was driven by strong sales of products in the Beauty Plus category, which has a higher price point. The primary contributor to the decline in Active Representatives was a decrease in the number of orders placed. While Active Representatives declined overall for 2006, we noted an improvement in the second half of the year, turning to slight growth in the fourth quarter. We believe this improvement was primarily driven by a variety of Representative value enhancing initiatives we implemented during the second half of 2006 in our U.S. business designed to increase Representative ordering activity, combined with our increased consumer investments and some easing in the negative impact from higher fuel prices. In the U.S., these Representative value enhancing initiatives included re indexing of certain earnings thresholds in our Sales Leadership program, distributing bonus brochures to higher performing Representatives and strengthening sales incentives. The decrease in 2006 operating margin in North America was primarily driven by incremental costs to implement restructuring initiatives, including costs associated with our decision to realign North America distribution operations, delayering and the closure of the Avon Salon & Spa. These incremental costs negatively impacted operating margin by 2.2 points. The decrease in operating margin was also due to substantially higher spending on 27 Table of Contents advertising, higher performance based compensation expenses, higher allocation of global expenses, and incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives, partially offset by expense reduction efforts. Latin America 2007 Compared to 2006 %/Point Change 2007 2006 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 3,298.9 $ 2,743.4 20 % 13 % Operating profit 483.1 424.0 14 % 3 % Operating margin 14.6 % 15.5 % (.9 ) (1.3 ) Units sold 9 % Active Representatives 8 % Total revenue increased during 2007, driven by growth in Active Representatives, reflecting significant investments in advertising and RVP, and a larger average order, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue for 2007 benefited from growth in most markets, particularly from growth of approximately 30% in each of Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Revenue growth in Brazil for 2007 was driven by increases in both average order and Active Representatives, primarily due to significant investments in advertising and RVP, recruiting advertising and field incentives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue in Mexico was flat in 2007, as a mid single digit increase in Active Representatives was offset by a lower average order. The increase in Active Representatives in Mexico primarily reflects strengthened training and incentives and the retraining of our zone managers in field fundamentals. The lower average order was mainly due to product mix and a higher share of sales from new Representatives. While we have seen improving field trends in our business in Mexico during 2007, this business is in the midst of a long term turnaround plan and we expect some variability in our quarterly performance. The decrease in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by higher spending on advertising and RVP and an unfavorable mix of products sold. These higher costs were partially offset by the impact of higher revenue, lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which positively impacted operating margin by .8 point, savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives, and the recognition of unclaimed sales related tax credits. Currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government in 2003 have impacted the ability of our subsidiary in Venezuela (Avon Venezuela) to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products. Unless official foreign exchange is made more readily available, Avon Venezuelas operations will continue to be negatively impacted as it will need to obtain more of its foreign currency needs from non government sources where the exchange rate is unfavorable as compared to the official rate. At December 31, 2007, Avon Venezuela had cash balances of approximately $45, primarily denominated in bolivars. During 2007, Avon Venezuela remitted dividends of approximately $40 at the official exchange rate. Avon Venezuela continues to receive official foreign exchange for some of its imports and other remittances. As a result, we continue to use the official rate to translate the financial statements of Avon Venezuela into U.S. dollars. In 2007, Avon Venezuelas revenue and operating profit represented approximately 3% and 7% of consolidated revenue and consolidated operating profit, respectively. 28 Table of Contents Latin America 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 2,743.4 $ 2,272.6 21 % 17 % Operating profit 424.0 453.2 (6 )% (10 )% Operating margin 15.5 % 19.9 % (4.4 ) (4.5 ) Units sold 8 % Active Representatives 11 % Total revenue increased in 2006, reflecting growth in Active Representatives and units sold, as well as favorable foreign exchange, primarily in Brazil. The region benefited from the fourth quarter 2005 acquisition of our licensee in Colombia, as that market contributed 8 points to the regions revenue growth. The region benefited from continued strength in Brazil, where revenues increased 32% due to larger average order and increased Active Representatives, reflecting new product launches supported by significant advertising and promotional activities. The increase in revenue in Brazil and the acquisition and growth of Colombia more than compensated for continued declines in Mexico, where revenues decreased 6%, mainly due to a decline in Active Representatives. The decline in Active Representatives reflected, in part, challenges related to field execution caused by a change in the attractiveness of incentives, including ineffective performance management for our zone managers. In 2006, we commenced a number of initiatives to improve performance in Mexico, including an upgrade of field talent and investments in incentives and motivation programs. The decrease in operating margin in Latin America during 2006 was most significantly impacted by increased spending on advertising, incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives, higher allocation of global expenses, and a 2005 gain on the sale of property in Mexico, partially offset by operating efficiencies due to the revenue increase. Additionally, incremental costs to implement our restructuring initiatives negatively impacted operating margin by 1.1 points. Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 2007 Compared to 2006 %/Point Change 2007 2006 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,308.6 $ 1,123.7 16 % 7 % Operating profit 33.9 (17.8 ) * * Operating margin 2.6 % (1.6 )% 4.2 3.1 Units sold 6 % Active Representatives 7 % * Calculation not meaningful Total revenue increased for 2007 reflecting growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. The revenue increase for 2007 was primarily driven by growth in Turkey and the U.K. Revenue growth in Turkey of over 35% for 2007 was primarily due to growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue growth in the U.K. of over 10% in 2007 benefited from growth in Active Representatives, mainly due to the strength of the Sales Leadership program, and favorable foreign exchange. Revenue in Turkey and the U.K. also benefited from new product launches and significant investments in advertising and RVP. Operating margin for 2006 was suppressed by 1.9 points due to $21.0 of expense associated with the resolution of a value added tax dispute in the U.K. in the third quarter of 2006. The increase in operating margin for 2007 was also driven by lower product costs due to favorable foreign exchange movements and savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives. These benefits to operating margin were partially offset by higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which negatively impacted operating margin by 1.1 points in 2007, higher spending on advertising and RVP and higher inventory obsolescence expense. 29 Table of Contents Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,123.7 $ 1,065.1 6 % 6 % Operating profit (17.8 ) 63.7 * * Operating margin (1.6 )% 6.0 % (7.6 ) (7.5 ) Units sold 3 % Active Representatives 5 % * Calculation not meaningful Total revenue increased reflecting growth in Active Representatives and units, with increases in revenues in most markets in the region, most significantly in Turkey and the U.K. Revenue growth of 23% in Turkey benefited from the continued strength of recruiting and field programs, as well as investments in advertising driving increased order size. Revenue in the U.K. increased 3%, reflecting strong Beauty growth driven by successful new product launches and increased advertising. Incremental costs, during 2006, associated with implementing restructuring initiatives, primarily costs related to delayering, drove the operating margin decline, and negatively impacted segment operating margin 3.0 points in 2006. Other contributing items include $21.0 of expense associated with the resolution of a value added tax dispute in the U.K in the third quarter of 2006; incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives; unfavorable foreign exchange on imported inventory in Turkey; spending on advertising; higher allocation of global expenses; and costs related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. These unfavorable year over year comparisons were partially offset by the impact of higher revenue and benefits associated with restructuring initiatives, primarily compensation related savings associated with our delayering initiative. Central & Eastern Europe 2007 Compared to 2006 %/Point Change 2007 2006 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,577.8 $ 1,320.2 20 % 10 % Operating profit 296.1 296.7 % (12 )% Operating margin 18.8 % 22.5 % (3.7 ) (4.3 ) Units sold 6 % Active Representatives 13 % Total revenue increased for 2007 reflecting growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a lower average order as our Representatives transitioned to a shorter selling cycle. Active Representative growth for 2007 benefited from additional selling opportunities that we provided to our Representatives through more frequent brochure distribution beginning at the end of June 2007, which encourages more frequent customer contact. We expect the additional selling opportunities to continue to benefit revenue and Active Representative growth in Central & Eastern Europe for the first half of 2008. The regions revenue growth in 2007 was primarily driven by Russia, as well as growth in all markets in the region. Revenue in Russia increased approximately 20% for 2007 due to strong Active Representative growth, which benefited from the additional selling opportunities, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue in Russia for 2007 also benefited from increased advertising, continued merchandising improvements, and the launch of Hello Tomorrow. The decrease in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by higher inventory obsolescence expense, higher spending on advertising and RVP, partially offset by lower product costs due to favorable foreign exchange movements and the impact of higher revenue. 30 Table of Contents Central & Eastern Europe 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,320.2 $ 1,226.3 8 % 4 % Operating profit 296.7 331.7 (11 )% (14 )% Operating margin 22.5 % 27.1 % (4.6 ) (4.8 ) Units sold (1 )% Active Representatives 8 % Total revenue increased in 2006 reflecting growth in Active Representatives and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower average order. Revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in Russia due to strong Active Representative growth and increased advertising, partially offset by a decline in other countries, principally Poland. This decline was mainly due to underperformance in color cosmetics during the first three quarters of 2006, primarily as a result of ineffective merchandising. The declines were also due to increased competition in Beauty. Color cosmetics sales grew during the fourth quarter, including in Poland, following changes made to color merchandising and increased advertising. Operating margin was negatively impacted by higher spending for advertising, higher allocation of global expenses and incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives. Asia Pacific 2007 Compared to 2006 %/Point Change 2007 2006 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 850.8 $ 810.8 5 % (1 )% Operating profit 64.3 42.5 51 % 35 % Operating margin 7.6 % 5.2 % 2.4 1.9 Units sold 2 % Active Representatives 4 % Total revenue increased for 2007 due to favorable foreign exchange. The regions revenue increase for 2007 was primarily driven by growth in the Philippines, partially offset by declines in Japan and Taiwan. Revenue in the Philippines for 2007 increased approximately 30%, driven by substantial growth in Active Representatives, supported by RVP initiatives, including the roll out of the Sales Leadership program nationwide, and investments in recruiting advertising, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue in Japan declined mid single digits for 2007, reflecting weak performance in skin care. In Japan, lower sales from direct mailing were partially offset by a modest increase in sales from direct selling, as this market continues to execute its multi year turnaround plan to obtain the right balance between direct selling and direct mail. While less than the overall revenue decline in the beauty market, revenue in Taiwan declined due to economic weakness. The increase in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which positively impacted operating margin by 2.2 points. Additionally, the operating margin improvement was due to lower inventory obsolescence expense and savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives, partially offset by higher spending on RVP and advertising and unfavorable category and country mixes of products sold. 31 Table of Contents Asia Pacific 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 810.8 $ 868.6 (7 )% (6 )% Operating profit 42.5 102.9 (59 )% (59 )% Operating margin 5.2 % 11.8 % (6.6 ) (6.6 ) Units sold (9 )% Active Representatives (12 )% The regions revenue decline during 2006 was primarily attributable to decreases in units sold and Active Representatives, reflecting continued declines in these measures in Japan, as well as the closing of our Indonesian operations in early 2006. Japans revenue declined 21%, driven by declines in the direct mail business, reflecting the ongoing rebalancing of our efforts between direct selling fundamentals and the number of direct mailings. While revenue declined in Japan during 2006, the decline in the second half was to a lesser extent than in the first half, as the business responded to actions we took to improve Representative economics, as well as a decision to restore some direct mailings. Asia Pacific operating margin declined, primarily due to incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives, lower revenue, higher allocation of global expenses, spending on advertising, and higher product costs (principally in Japan). Additionally, incremental expenses during 2006 for costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which decreased segment margin by .7 point, contributed to the operating margin decline. China 2007 Compared to 2006 %/Point Change 2007 2006 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 280.5 $ 211.8 32 % 26 % Operating profit 2.0 (10.8 ) * * Operating margin .7 % (5.1 )% 5.8 5.5 Units sold 19 % Active Representatives 145 % * Calculation not meaningful Total revenue in China increased significantly in 2007, primarily due to an increase in Active Representatives reflecting further expansion of the direct selling business, which contributed over one half of the regions revenue in 2007. Active Representatives increased significantly in 2007 due to Representative recruiting, as well as the absence of a meaningful base comparison for the first half of 2006. The lower average order was mainly due to a higher share of sales from new Representatives. At the same time that we have been building on direct selling, we have seen ordering activity levels maintained by our beauty boutiques as they continue to engage in direct selling by servicing our Representatives. Additionally, the number of beauty boutiques has remained stable over the last year. Revenue in 2007 benefited from representative recruiting and continued significant investments in advertising. The increase in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by the impact of higher revenue and a reduction of a reserve for statutory liabilities. These positive impacts were partially offset by ongoing higher spending on RVP and fees paid to registered service centers for providing services to our Active Representatives. 32 Table of Contents China 2006 Compared to 2005 %/Point Change 2006 2005 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 211.8 $ 206.5 3 % % Operating profit (10.8 ) 7.7 * * Operating margin (5.1 )% 3.8 % (8.9 ) (9.1 ) Units sold 1 % Active Representatives * * Calculation not meaningful Our business in China continued to evolve with the opening of direct selling. In late February 2006, Avon received the first national license to commence direct selling under directives issued by the Chinese government in late 2005. Since then, we have been actively recruiting a direct selling force, called Sales Promoters, throughout the country. These Sales Promoters must be trained and certified according to government regulations. As of December 31, 2006, we had over 350,000 certified Sales Promoters, approximately 150,000 of whom fit our standard definition of Active Representatives. We have been and continue to be engaged in comprehensive training of these Sales Promoters to help them build their business by developing their customer base and product knowledge. Prior to the reopening of direct selling we had sold our products in China through a network of licensed beauty boutiques, as well as dealer owned and company owned store counters. The company owned store counters were exited as part of our restructuring initiatives. In addition to being a retail boutique, a beauty boutique can now participate in direct selling by operating as a service center to the Sales Promoters, an essential element of the direct selling model stipulated in the Direct Selling regulations, for which they can earn service fees from Avon. Chinas revenue is now generated through Sales Promoters, beauty boutiques and dealer owned counters. Total revenue increased in 2006, as significant growth in direct selling more than offset the lower revenue from beauty boutiques, as they reduced their order sizes in connection with the resumption of direct selling, as well as the unfavorable impact of the exit of company owned counters, which had a negative nine point impact on 2006 revenue growth. Total revenue in 2006 also benefited from the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Due to the significant growth of direct selling since our March 2006 launch, during 2006, direct selling became a greater portion of our business and is expected to continue as it is built up. At the same time that we have been building on direct selling, we have stabilized our beauty boutiques. During 2006, we did not experience a significant decline in the number of beauty boutiques, and we ended 2006 with a similar number of active beauty boutiques as compared to the beginning of 2006. The operating margin decrease was primarily driven by significantly higher spending on advertising, fees paid to registered service centers for providing services to our Active Representatives, and other costs associated with the launch of direct selling. 33 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, commercial paper and borrowings under lines of credit. We currently believe that existing cash, cash from operations (including the impacts of cash required for restructuring initiatives) and available sources of public and private financing are adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, dividends, capital expenditures, the share repurchase program, possible acquisitions and other cash needs in the short and long term. We may, from time to time, seek to repurchase our equity or to retire our outstanding debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to derivative instruments or otherwise. During 2007, we repurchased approximately 17.3 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $667 million. In February 2005, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of $1,000.0 of our common stock over a five year period. This program was completed in December 2007. In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of $2,000.0 of our common stock over a five year period, which began in December 2007 following completion of the previous $1,000.0 share repurchase program. Retirements of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. We may also elect to incur additional debt or issue equity or convertible securities to finance ongoing operations, acquisitions or to meet our other liquidity needs. We expect to issue additional long term debt as we seek to reduce our outstanding commercial paper. In August 2007, we entered into treasury lock agreements (the locks) with notional amounts totaling $500.0 that expired on January 31, 2008. The locks have been designated as cash flow hedges and are being used to hedge exposure to a possible rise in interest rates, as we expect to incur long term debt to refinance our commercial paper. At December 31, 2007, we recorded unrealized losses of $25.3 in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the locks. On January 31, 2008, we extended the maturity date of the locks to July 31, 2008, as we expect to incur long term debt by this date. Any issuances of equity securities or convertible securities could have a dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our current shareholders and may adversely impact earnings per share in future periods. Our liquidity could also be impacted by dividends, capital investments and acquisitions. At any given time, we may be in discussions and negotiations with potential acquisition candidates. Acquisitions, by their nature, involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Balance Sheet Data 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 963.4 $ 1,198.9 Total debt 2,097.4 1,786.3 Working capital 462.0 809.2 The increase in total debt and decrease in working capital primarily relates to higher short term commercial paper borrowings. Cash Flows 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 589.8 $ 796.1 $ 895.5 Net cash used by investing activities (287.2 ) (207.9 ) (343.1 ) Net cash used by financing activities (597.1 ) (490.4 ) (226.7 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents 59.0 42.4 (36.6 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $206.3 during 2007, primarily due to higher payments for inventory purchases, higher incentive based compensation payments in 2007 for compensation earned in 2006 and higher interest payments, partially offset by lower payments associated with restructuring initiatives. We expect cash provided by operating activities for full year 2008 to be substantially higher than full year 2007. Inventory levels have continued to increase during 2007 from $900.3 at December 31, 2006 to $1,041.8 at December 31, 2007, partially driven by actions taken in an effort to ensure service levels to our Representatives and due to the impacts of foreign exchange. New inventory life cycle management processes leveraged with initiatives such as PLS, SSI, ERP implementation and the Sales and Operations Planning process are expected to improve inventory levels in the long term. We expect these initiatives to help us deliver targeted improvements of a 3 to 5 inventory day reduction each year, starting in 2008, for the next 4 to 5 years. 34 Table of Contents We maintain defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans (see Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans). Our funding policy for these plans is based on legal requirements and cash flows. The amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Estimates). The future funding for these plans will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of associates electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. Based on current assumptions, we expect to contribute approximately $9 and $23 to our U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, in 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $99.4 during 2006, primarily due to cash payments of approximately $117.0 associated with restructuring charges, and additional cash payments associated with other costs to implement restructuring initiatives. To a lesser extent, unfavorable working capital levels in inventory and accounts receivable contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities. These decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by favorable working capital levels in accounts payable and lower payments associated with incentive compensation as compared to 2005. Net Cash Used by Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities in 2007 was $79.3 higher than in 2006 resulting from higher capital expenditures during 2007 and from payments associated with an acquisition of a licensee in Egypt during 2007, partially offset by the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in our two joint venture subsidiaries in China for approximately $39 during 2006. Capital expenditures during 2007 were $278.5 compared with $174.8 in 2006. The increase in capital spending was primarily driven by spending in 2007 for capacity expansion, the construction of a new distribution facility in North America and information systems (including the continued development of the ERP system). Plant construction, expansion and modernization projects were in progress at December 31, 2007, with an estimated cost to complete of approximately $308. Capital expenditures in 2008 are currently expected to be in the range of $350 to $400 and will be funded by cash from operations. These expenditures will include investments for capacity expansion, modernization of existing facilities, the construction of new distribution facilities in Latin America and information systems (including the continued development of the ERP system). Net cash used by investing activities in 2006 was $135.2 lower than in 2005 resulting from lower capital expenditures due to fewer major construction projects during 2006, and the 2005 purchase of the Avon direct selling business from our licensee in Colombia for $154.0, partially offset by the 2006 acquisition of the remaining minority interest in our two joint venture subsidiaries in China for approximately $39. Capital expenditures during 2006 were $174.8 compared with $206.8 in 2005. The decrease in capital spending was primarily driven by spending in 2005 for our global research and development facility, capacity expansion and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Net Cash Used by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities in 2007 was $106.7 higher than in 2006, mainly driven by higher repurchases of common stock during 2007, partially offset by higher short term borrowings and higher proceeds from stock option exercises during 2007. Net cash used by financing activities in 2006 was $263.7 higher than in 2005, mainly driven by higher borrowings during 2005 and lower proceeds from stock option exercises during 2006, partially offset by lower repurchases of common stock during 2006. We purchased approximately 17.3 million shares of Avon common stock for $666.8 during 2007, as compared to approximately 11.6 million shares of Avon common stock for $355.1 during 2006 and approximately 22.9 million shares of Avon common stock for $728.0 during 2005, under our previously announced share repurchase programs and through acquisition of stock from employees in connection with tax payments upon vesting of restricted stock units. As noted previously, we completed our $1,000.0 share repurchase program in December 2007 and in October 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $2,000.0 of our common stock over a five year period, which began in December 2007 following completion of the previous $1,000.0 share repurchase program. We increased our quarterly dividend payments to $.185 per share in 2007 from $.175 per share in 2006. In February 2008, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $.200 per share. 35 Table of Contents Debt and Contractual Financial Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2007, our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013andBeyond Total Short term debt $ 906.7 $ $ $ $ $ $ 906.7 Long term debt 16.9 300.2 500.0 375.0 1,192.1 Capital lease obligations 5.9 3.6 2.0 1.3 1.1 13.9 Total debt 929.5 303.8 2.0 501.3 1.1 375.0 2,112.7 Debt related interest 63.4 63.4 41.9 41.9 16.3 68.8 295.7 Total debt related 992.9 367.2 43.9 543.2 17.4 443.8 2,408.4 Operating leases 86.7 66.5 48.4 31.6 23.0 42.4 298.6 Purchase obligations 155.8 70.4 47.1 25.3 17.7 64.2 380.5 Benefit obligations (2) 33.3 12.5 12.9 13.6 14.0 81.2 167.5 Total debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments (1) $ 1,268.7 $ 516.6 $ 152.3 $ 613.7 $ 72.1 $ 631.6 $ 3,255.0 (1) The amount of debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments excludes amounts due pursuant to derivative transactions. The table also excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding, are generally consistent from year to year, and are short term in nature. The table does not include any reserves for income taxes under FIN 48 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. At December 31, 2007, our reserves for income taxes, including interest and penalties, totaled $155.4. (2) Amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as expected contributions for 2008 to our funded pension benefit plans. See Note 4, Debt and Other Financing, and Note 12, Leases and Commitments, for further information on our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 13, Restructuring Initiatives, we have a remaining liability of $143.9 at December 31, 2007, associated with the restructuring charges recorded to date, and we also expect to record additional restructuring charges of $49.6 in future periods to implement the actions approved to date. The significant majority of these liabilities will require cash payments during 2008. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2007, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements. Capital Resources Total debt at December 31, 2007 increased $311.1 to $2,097.4 from $1,786.3 at December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher commercial paper borrowings. We have a five year, $1,000.0 revolving credit and competitive advance facility (the credit facility), which expires in January 2011. The credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime or 1/2% plus the federal funds rate. The credit facility has an annual fee of $.675, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains various covenants, including a financial covenant which requires Avons interest coverage ratio (determined in relation to our consolidated pretax income and interest expense) to equal or exceed 4:1. The credit facility also provides for a possible extension of the term by up to two years and possible increases by up to an aggregate incremental principal amount of $250.0, subject to the consent of the affected lenders under the credit facility. At December 31, 2007, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. We have a $1,000.0 commercial paper program. Under this program, we may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws, for a cumulative face amount not to exceed $1,000.0 outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment. The commercial paper 36 Table of Contents program is supported by our credit facility. Outstanding commercial paper effectively reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility. At December 31, 2007, we had commercial paper outstanding of $701.6. In April 2007, we entered into a one year Euro 50 million ($72.9 at the exchange rate on December 31, 2007) uncommitted credit facility (Euro credit facility) with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. Borrowings under the Euro credit facility bear interest at the Euro LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The Euro credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. The Euro credit facility is designated as a hedge of our investments in our Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. At December 31, 2007, there was $32.8 (Euro 22.5 million) outstanding under the Euro credit facility. In August 2006, we entered into a one year Japanese yen 11.0 billion ($96.3 at the exchange rate on December 31, 2007) uncommitted credit facility (yen credit facility) with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. Borrowings under the yen credit facility bear interest at the yen LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The yen credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. The yen credit facility was used to repay the Japanese yen 9.0 billion note which came due in September 2006, as well as for other general corporate purposes. The yen credit facility is designated as a hedge of our net investment in our Japanese subsidiary. In August 2007, we entered into an amendment of our one year Japanese yen 11.0 billion ($96.3 at the exchange rate on December 31, 2007) uncommitted credit facility with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. The amendment provides for the extension of the yen credit facility until August 2008. At December 31, 2007, $96.3 (Japanese yen 11.0 billion) was outstanding under the yen credit facility. At December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants in our indentures (see Note 4, Debt and Other Financing). Such indentures do not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities. We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means. Since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and forecasted transactions, we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives. The master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in certain circumstances, including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of Avon prior to the merger. Interest Rate Risk Our long term, fixed rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. We use interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the fixed rate on the debt to a floating interest rate, to manage our interest rate exposure. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 30% of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. Avons total exposure to floating interest rates at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was approximately 60% and 50%, respectively. Our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at December 31, 2007, a hypothetical 50 basis point change (either an increase or a decrease) in interest rates prevailing at that date, sustained for one year, would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt. In August 2007, we entered into locks with notional amounts totaling $500.0 that expired on January 31, 2008. The locks have been designated as cash flow hedges and are being used to hedge exposure to a possible rise in interest rates, as we expect to incur long term debt to refinance our commercial paper. At December 31, 2007, we recorded unrealized losses of $25.3 in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the locks. On January 31, 2008, we extended the maturity date of the locks to July 31, 2008, as we expect to incur long term debt by this date. Changes 37 Table of Contents in interest rates will affect the fair value of these locks. At December 31, 2007, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately $17 decrease in unrealized losses and a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximately $18 increase in unrealized losses. Foreign Currency Risk We operate globally, with operations in various locations around the world. Over the past three years, approximately 75% to 80% of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. The functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency. We are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations, primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities. At December 31, 2007, the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Colombian peso, the Euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Venezuelan bolivar. We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to, and, therefore, cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. Based on our foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2007, the impact of a 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. The hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at December 31, 2007, adjusted for an assumed 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these hedging contracts. Credit Risk of Financial Instruments We attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements only with major international financial institutions with A or higher credit ratings as issued by Standard & Poors Corporation. Our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts, swaps or options with major international financial institutions. Although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments, we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses, if any, would not be material. Non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a write off of $19.9 at December 31, 2007. In addition, in the event of non performance by such counterparties, we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
