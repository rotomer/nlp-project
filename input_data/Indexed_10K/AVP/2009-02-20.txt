ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries (Avon or the Company) should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. When used in this discussion, the terms Avon, Company, we, our or us mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries. OVERVIEW We are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Our business is conducted worldwide, primarily in the direct selling channel. We presently have sales operations in 66 countries and territories, including the United States, and distribute products in 44 more. Our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in six regions: Latin America; North America; Central & Eastern Europe; Western Europe, Middle East & Africa; Asia Pacific; and China. We centrally manage global Brand Marketing, Supply Chain and Sales organizations. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we changed our product categories from Beauty, Beauty Plus and Beyond Beauty to Beauty, Fashion and Home. Beauty consists of cosmetics, fragrances, skin care and toiletries (CFT). Fashion consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear and accessories. Home consists of gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure, childrens and nutritional products. Sales from Health and Wellness products and mark., a global cosmetics brand that focuses on the market for young women, are included among these three categories based on product type. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through the direct selling by 5.8 million active independent Representatives, who are independent contractors and not employees of Avon. The success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting, retaining and servicing our Representatives. We view the geographic diversity of our businesses as a strategic advantage in part because it allows us to participate in higher growth Beauty markets internationally. In developed markets, such as the United States, we seek to achieve growth in line with that of the overall beauty market, while in developing and emerging markets we seek to achieve higher growth targets. During 2008, approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside the U.S. When we first penetrate a market, we typically experience high growth rates and, as we reach scale in these markets, growth rates generally decline. At the end of 2005, we launched a comprehensive, multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth. In January 2008, we announced the final initiatives of our restructuring program that was launched in 2005 under our turnaround plan. In 2007, we completed the analysis of our optimal product portfolio and made decisions on exit strategies for non optimal products under our Product Line Simplification program (PLS). In 2007, we also launched our Strategic Sourcing Initiative (SSI). We expect our restructuring initiatives to deliver annualized savings of approximately $430 once all initiatives are fully implemented by 2011 2012. We also expect to achieve annualized benefits in excess of $200 and $250 from PLS and SSI, respectively, in 2010. As discussed further below, in February 2009 we announced a new restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan. During 2008, revenue increased 8%, and Active Representatives increased 7% (with increases in all segments), fueled by investments in advertising and the Representative Value Proposition (RVP). Sales from each of our product categories increased, with products in the Beauty category increasing 10%. During 2008, revenue grew in all segments except North America, which was adversely affected by the slowing macro economic environment, deteriorating consumer confidence and higher year over year fuel prices. We benefited from strength in developing and emerging markets around the globe that more than offset the unfavorable impact of economic softness in North America. See the Segment Review section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, revenue declined as compared to 2007, due to the significant negative impact of foreign exchange and the depressed economy. We expect the global economic pressures and negative impact of foreign currency will continue or could worsen in the foreseeable future and 2009 will be a challenging year. Given the current macro economic environment, we expect that revenue growth in 2009 will be somewhat lower than our long term revenue growth, which is expected to average mid single digits, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We also expect that operating margin in 2009 will continue to be pressured by the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange. Operating margin will also be negatively impacted by additional restructuring charges during 2009. We believe benefits from our SSI program, focusing on manufacturing productivity, changing sourcing of raw materials and finished goods to use exchange rates to our advantage, and some softening in commodity costs will help to partially offset the negative impact of foreign exchange. We will continue to look for ways to transform our cost structure and intend to reduce non strategic spending during 2009. We will also continue our strategies of investing in advertising and our Representatives. 20 Table of Contents We believe that our strong operating cash flow and global cash balances of over $1 billion, coupled with the continuing execution of our turnaround strategies and the competitive advantages of our direct selling business model, will allow us to look beyond our anticipated challenges in 2009 and continue our focus on long term sustainable, profitable growth. STRATEGIC INITIATIVES Advertising and Representative Value Proposition (RVP) Investing in advertising is a key strategy. We significantly increased spending on advertising over the past three years. During 2008, we increased our investment in advertising by $22.1 or 6%. Approximately 70% of the incremental spending was spent in Russia, China and the United Kingdom. The incremental spending on advertising was at a rate somewhat less than revenue growth. The advertising investments supported new product launches, such as, Anew Ultimate Contouring Eye System, Bond Girl fragrance, Pro to Go Lipstick, Anew Ultimate Age Repair Elixir, Supershock Mascara, Avon Solutions Hydra Radiance, U by Ungaro fragrances and Anew Rejuvenate Eye. Advertising investments also included advertising to recruit Representatives. We have also continued to forge alliances with celebrities, including alliances with Patrick Dempsey and Ferragamo Parfums S.P.A. for the U by Ungaro line of fragrances. We continued to invest in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our Representatives. We have committed significant investments for extensive research to determine the payback on advertising and field tools and actions, and the optimal balance of these tools and actions in our markets. We have allocated these significant investments in proprietary direct selling analytics to better understand the drivers of value for our Representatives. We measure our investment in RVP as the incremental cost to provide these value enhancing initiatives. During 2008, we invested approximately $83 incrementally in our Representatives through RVP by continued implementation of our Sales Leadership program, enhanced incentives, increased sales campaign frequency, improved commissions and new e business tools. This incremental investment was ahead of revenue growth. Investing in RVP will continue to be a key strategy. We will continue to look for ways to improve the earnings opportunity for Representatives through various means, including the following: Evaluating optimum discount structures in select markets; Continuing the roll out of our Sales Leadership Program, which offers Representatives an enhanced career opportunity; Strategically examining the fee structure and brochure costs to enhance Representative economics; Recalibrating the frequency of campaigns to maximize Representative selling opportunities; and Applying the optimal balance of advertising and field investment in our key markets. While the reward and effort will be different within our global portfolio of businesses, we believe that web enablement is a key element to reduce Representative effort worldwide. We will continue to focus on improving Internet based tools for our Representatives. Product Line Simplification During 2006, we began to analyze our product line, under our PLS program, to develop a smaller range of better performing, more profitable products. The overall goal of PLS is to identify an improved product assortment to drive higher sales of more profitable products. During 2007, we completed the analysis of our product portfolio, concluded on the appropriate product assortment going forward and made decisions regarding the ultimate disposition of products that will no longer be part of our improved product assortment (such as selling at a discount, donation, or destruction). During 2007 and 2006, we recorded PLS charges of $187.8 and $81.4, respectively, primarily incremental inventory obsolescence expense of $167.3 and $72.6, respectively. We recorded final PLS charges in the fourth quarter of 2007. During the first half of 2008, we began to implement PLS in the U.K and early results appear favorable; however, the transition is a long process and will continue into 2009. In the second half of 2008, we began implementing PLS in all other markets, with full implementation expected by the end of 2009. We expect that sales and marketing benefits will account for approximately 85% of our projected benefits. Improving our product assortment will allow us to increase exposure and improve presentation of the remaining products within our brochure, which is expected to yield more pleasurable consumer shopping experiences, easier Representative selling experiences, and greater sales per brochure page. A second source of benefits from PLS results from transferable demand. Transferable demand refers to the concept that when products with redundant characteristics are removed from our product assortment, some demand from the eliminated products will transfer to the remaining 21 Table of Contents products that offer similar or comparable product characteristics. As part of PLS, when we identify products that have sufficient overlap of characteristics, we will eliminate the products with the lowest profitability and we expect the products that we retain will generate more profit. A third source of benefits from PLS is less price discounting. As we implement operating procedures under PLS, we anticipate introducing fewer new products and lengthening the lifecycle of products in our offering, which we expect will lead to less aggressive price discounting over a products life cycle. In addition to the benefits above, we also expect supply chain benefits to account for approximately 15% of our projected benefits. We expect improvements to cost of sales once PLS is fully implemented, primarily from a reduction in inventory obsolescence expense as a result of better managed inventory levels, lower variable spending on warehousing, more efficient manufacturing utilization and lower purchasing costs. We also expect operating expenses to benefit from a reduction in distribution costs and benefits to inventory productivity. We estimate that we realized total benefits of approximately $40 during 2008 and we expect to realize benefits of approximately $120 in 2009 and in excess of $200 in 2010. Strategic Sourcing Initiative We launched SSI in 2007. This initiative is expected to reduce direct and indirect costs of materials, goods and services. Under this initiative, we are shifting our purchasing strategy from a local, commodity oriented approach towards a globally coordinated effort which leverages our volumes, allows our suppliers to benefit from economies of scale, utilizes sourcing best practices and processes, and better matches our suppliers capabilities with our needs. Beyond lower costs, our goals from SSI include improving asset management, service for Representatives and vendor relationships. During 2008, we realized benefits of approximately $114 from SSI. In addition, we were able to offset commodity cost increases of approximately $21 for full year 2008 due to SSI actions already in place. We expect to realize annualized benefits from this initiative in excess of $250 by the end of 2009, with a full year of benefit in 2010. As a result, we expect to realize benefits of approximately $200 in 2009 and benefits in excess of $250 in 2010. We continue to implement a Sales and Operations Planning process that is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues. Enterprise Resource Planning System We are in the midst of a multi year global roll out of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which is expected to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes. We began our global roll out in Europe in 2005 and have since implemented ERP in our European manufacturing facilities, our larger European direct selling operations and in the U.S. As part of this continuing global roll out, we expect to implement ERP in several countries over the next several years leveraging the knowledge gained from our previous implementations. During 2008, we worked to improve the effectiveness of ERP in the U.S. and began to implement in the other markets within North America, as well as in certain smaller European direct selling operations. During 2008, we also began the multi year implementation process in Latin America in one market. In Latin America, we plan to implement modules of ERP in a gradual manner across key markets over the next several years. Zero Overhead Growth We have institutionalized a zero overhead growth philosophy that aims to offset inflation through productivity improvements. These improvements in productivity will come primarily from SSI and our restructuring initiatives. We have defined overhead as fixed expenses such as costs associated with our sales and marketing infrastructure, and management and administrative activities. Overhead excludes variable expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses, such as shipping and handling costs and bonuses to our employees in the sales organization, and also excludes consumer and strategic investments that are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, such as advertising, RVP, research and development and brochure costs. Restructuring Programs 2005 Program We launched our original restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan in late 2005 (the 2005 Program). In January 2008, we announced the final initiatives that are part of the 2005 Program. We expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement restructuring initiatives under this program of approximately $530 before taxes. We have recorded $504.2 through December 31, 2008, ($60.6 in 2008, $158.3 in 2007, $228.8 in 2006 and $56.5 in 2005) for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the 2005 Program, primarily for employee related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits, and professional service fees related to these initiatives. We expect to record a majority of the remaining costs by the end of 2009. 22 Table of Contents The costs to implement restructuring initiatives during 2005 through 2008 are associated with specific actions, including: organization realignment and downsizing in each region and global through a process called delayering, taking out layers to bring senior management closer to operations; the phased outsourcing of certain services, including certain finance, information technology, human resource and customer service processes, and the move of certain services from markets to lower cost shared service centers; the restructure of certain international direct selling operations; the realignment of certain distribution and manufacturing operations, including the realignment of certain of our North America and Latin America distribution operations; the automation of certain distribution processes; the exit of certain unprofitable operations, including the closure of the Avon Salon & Spa, the closure of our operations in Indonesia, the exit of a product line in China and the exit of the beComing product line in the U.S.; and the reorganization of certain functions, primarily sales related organizations. Actions implemented under these restructuring initiatives resulted in savings of approximately $270 in 2008, as compared to savings of approximately $230 in 2007. We expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately $430 once all initiatives are fully implemented by 2011 2012. We expect the savings to reach approximately $300 in 2009. 2009 Restructuring Program In February 2009, we announced a new restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan (the 2009 Program). The restructuring initiatives under the 2009 Program are expected to focus on restructuring our global supply chain operations, realigning certain local business support functions to a more regional basis to drive increased efficiencies, and streamlining transaction related services, including selective outsourcing. We expect to incur restructuring charges and other costs to implement these initiatives in the range of $300 to $400 before taxes over the next several years. We are targeting annualized savings under the 2009 Program of approximately $200 upon full implementation by 2012 2013. See Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives, on pages F 33 through F 37 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Information relating to new accounting standards is included Note 2, New Accounting Standards, on pages F 10 through F 11 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 23 Table of Contents KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Within the following discussion and analysis, we utilize the key performance indicators (KPIs) defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business. KPI Definition Growth in Active Representatives This indicator is based on the number of Representatives submitting an order in a campaign, totaled for all campaigns in the related period. This amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period, to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days (for example, holiday schedules). To determine the growth in Active Representatives, this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year. Change in Units This indicator is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period, as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year. Units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product (for example, gift with purchase or purchase with purchase), but exclude free samples. Inventory Days This indicator is equal to the number of days of historical cost of sales covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies. Restructuring Reserves We record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Post Employment Benefits for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement. One time, involuntary benefit arrangements and disposal costs, primarily contract termination costs, are accounted for under the provisions of FAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. One time, voluntary benefit arrangements are accounted for under the provisions of FAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. We evaluate impairment issues under the provisions of FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. We estimate the expense for these initiatives, when approved by the appropriate corporate authority, by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans. These expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits, impairment of property, plant and equipment, contract termination payments for leases, and any other qualifying exit costs. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel. Such costs represent managements best estimate, but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time, including attrition rates. Estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable Representatives contact their customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the U.S. and a two to four week duration outside the U.S. The Representative purchases products directly from Avon and may or may not sell them to an end user. In general, the Representative, an independent contractor, remits a payment to Avon each sales campaign, which relates to the prior campaign cycle. The Representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid; however, there are circumstances where the Representative fails to make the required payment. We record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances. Over the past three years, annual bad debt expense has been in the range of $145 to $195, or approximately 1.7% of total revenue. We generally have no detailed information concerning, or any communication with, any end user of our products beyond the Representative. We have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectability of any accounts receivable balances due from the Representative to us. If the financial condition of our Representatives were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 24 Table of Contents Allowances for Sales Returns We record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. Over the past three years, sales returns have been in the range of $295 to $370, or approximately 3.4% of total revenue. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies, or for other reasons, additional allowances may be required. Provisions for Inventory Obsolescence We record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. In determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence, we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision. If actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence. Annual obsolescence expense was $80.8, $280.6 and $179.7 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 2007 and 2006 included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of $167.3 and $72.6, respectively, related to our PLS program and 2006 also includes $20.5 related to our decision to discontinue the sale of heavily discounted excess products. Obsolescence expense for 2008 benefited by approximately $13 from changes in estimates to our disposition plan under our PLS program. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Expense We maintain defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Additionally, we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for certain current and retired executives (see Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans). For 2008, the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets, including the U.S. and non U.S. plans was 7.66%. In determining the long term rates of return, we consider the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies, historical rates of return and current economic forecasts. We evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary. The majority of our pension plan assets relate to the U.S. pension plan. The assumed rate of return for 2008 for the U.S. plan was 8%, which was based on an asset allocation of approximately 35% in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities (which are expected to earn approximately 4% to 6% in the long term) and 65% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 8% to 10% in the long term). Historical rates of return on the assets of the U.S. plan for the most recent 10 year and 20 year periods were 2.0% and 7.6%, respectively. In the U.S. plan, our asset allocation policy has favored U.S. equity securities, which have lost .7% and returned 8.4%, respectively, over the 10 year and 20 year periods. The plan assets in the U.S. lost 26.2% and returned 9.3% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rates for our more significant plans, including our U.S. plan, were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan. The weighted average discount rate for U.S. and non U.S. plans determined on this basis was 6.11% at December 31, 2008, and 5.88% at December 31, 2007. Our funding requirements may be impacted by regulations or interpretations thereof. Our calculations of pension, postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent upon the use of assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, interest cost, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, mortality rates, the number of associate retirements, the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 31, 2008, we had pretax actuarial losses and prior service credits totaling $538.4 and $260.6 for the U.S. and non U.S. plans, respectively, that have not yet been charged to expense. These actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity. While we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension, postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense. During 2008, the plan assets experienced significant losses, which were mostly due to unfavorable returns on equity securities. These unfavorable returns will increase pension cost in future periods. For 2009, our assumption for the expected rate of return on assets is 8.0% and 7.2% for our U.S. and non U.S. plans, respectively. Our assumptions are reviewed and determined on an annual basis. 25 Table of Contents A 50 basis point change (in either direction) in the expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases, would have had the following effect on 2008 pension expense: Increase/(Decrease) inPension Expense 50 basispointIncrease 50 basispointDecrease Rate of return on assets (6.0 ) 6.0 Discount rate (8.6 ) 8.4 Rate of compensation increase 1.2 (1.5 ) Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future, in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made. Deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. when management concludes that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Deferred taxes are provided on earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. We file income tax returns in many jurisdictions. In 2009, a number of income tax returns are scheduled to close by statute and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed. If Avons filing positions are ultimately upheld, it is possible that the 2009 provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments. In accordance with FIN 48, we recognize the benefit of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. Share based Compensation All share based payments to employees are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant. We use a Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options. This model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share based compensation may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Loss Contingencies In accordance with FAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable. Our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation, which, by its nature is unpredictable. We believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED Favorable (Unfavorable)%/Point Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs.2007 2007 vs.2006 Total revenue $ 10,690.1 $ 9,938.7 $ 8,763.9 8 % 13 % Cost of sales 3,949.1 3,941.2 3,416.5 % (15 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 5,401.7 5,124.8 4,586.0 (5 )% (12 )% Operating profit 1,339.3 872.7 761.4 53 % 15 % Interest expense 100.4 112.2 99.6 11 % (13 )% Interest income (37.1 ) (42.2 ) (55.3 ) (12 )% (24 )% Other expense, net 37.7 6.6 13.6 * 51 % Net income $ 875.3 $ 530.7 $ 477.6 65 % 11 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.04 $ 1.21 $ 1.06 69 % 14 % Advertising expenses(1) $ 390.5 $ 368.4 $ 248.9 (6 )% (48 )% Gross margin 63.1 % 60.3 % 61.0 % 2.8 (.7 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses as a % of total revenue 50.5 % 51.6 % 52.3 % 1.1 .7 Operating margin 12.5 % 8.8 % 8.7 % 3.7 .1 Effective tax rate 29.3 % 33.0 % 31.8 % 3.7 (1.2 ) Units sold 1 % 7 % Active Representatives 7 % 9 % * Calculation not meaningful (1) Advertising expenses are included within selling, general and administrative expenses. Total Revenue Total revenue increased 8% in 2008, with foreign exchange contributing 3 percentage points to the revenue growth. Revenue grew in all segments, except North America. Revenue growth was driven by an increase of 7% in Active Representatives. On a category basis, the 2008 increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase of 10% in Beauty sales, with increases in all sub categories of Beauty. Within the Beauty category, fragrance grew 9%, color grew 11%, skin care grew 10%, and personal care grew 8%. Fashion sales increased 6%, while Home sales decreased 3%. Total revenue increased 13% in 2007 with growth in all segments. Revenue growth was driven by an increase of 9% in Active Representatives, while foreign exchange contributed 5 percentage points to the revenue growth. Additional selling opportunities in Central & Eastern Europe had a minimal impact on Active Representative growth. On a category basis, the 2007 increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase of 15% in Beauty sales. Within the Beauty category, fragrance increased 20%, color increased 16%, skin care increased 6% and personal care increased 21%. Fashion sales increased 12% and Home sales increased 6%. For additional discussion of the changes in revenue by segment, see the Segment Review section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 2.8 points in 2008, primarily due to a decrease in inventory obsolescence provisions in 2008, which benefited gross margin by 2.0 points, and from increased pricing and favorable product mix, which benefited gross margin by 1.3 points. These benefits to gross margin were partially offset by higher commodity costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on product cost in Europe. 2007 included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of $167.3 related to our PLS program. Obsolescence expense for 2008 also benefited by approximately $13 from changes in estimates to our disposition plan under our PLS program. 27 Table of Contents Gross margin decreased .7 point in 2007, primarily due to an increase in inventory obsolescence provisions of approximately $100 in 2007, which negatively impacted gross margin by 1.1 points, and an unfavorable mix of products sold, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. As discussed in the Overview section, 2007 and 2006 included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of $167.3 and $72.6, respectively, related to our decision to discontinue the sale of certain products as part of our PLS program. Additionally, 2006 included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of $20.5 related to our decisions to discontinue the sale of certain heavily discounted products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $276.9 during 2008, primarily due to the following: higher investments in RVP and advertising of approximately $105; higher variable expenses such as freight from increased sales volume and brochure costs; higher overhead primarily due to higher marketing costs; and the impact of foreign exchange. These higher costs were partially offset by lower costs incurred to implement our restructuring initiatives of $99.8, due to costs associated with previously approved initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $538.8 during 2007, primarily due to the following: higher investments in advertising and RVP of approximately $240; higher variable expenses such as freight and commissions from increased sales volume; and increased distribution costs as a percentage of revenue. These higher costs were partially offset by $71.8 of lower costs incurred to implement our restructuring initiatives and savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives. Additionally, 2007 benefited from a favorable comparison to 2006 which included a one time charge of $21.0 related to the resolution of a long standing dispute regarding value added taxes in the U.K., the recognition of unclaimed sales related tax credits and a reduction of a reserve for statutory liabilities. See the Segment Review section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information related to changes in operating margin by segment. Other Expenses Interest expense decreased in 2008, primarily due to lower domestic interest rates. Interest expense increased in 2007 as compared to 2006, mainly due to higher borrowings to support our share repurchase programs, as well as increases in domestic interest rates. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 50% and 30% of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR, respectively. The total exposure of our debt to floating interest rates at December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, was approximately 65% and 60%, respectively. Interest income decreased in 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest income decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances. Other expense, net increased in 2008, primarily due to net foreign exchange losses in 2008, as compared to foreign exchange gains in 2007. Other expense, net decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange gains in 2007. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for 2008 was 29.3%, compared to 33.0% for 2007 and 31.8% for 2006. During 2008, the tax rate was favorably impacted by 3.8 points due to an audit settlement, partially offset by 1.2 points from the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The rate was also favorably impacted by changes in the earnings mix of international subsidiaries, which is not expected to recur. During 2007, the tax rate was favorably impacted by approximately 2.0 points due to the net release of valuation allowances, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of restructuring and PLS initiatives. During 2006, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by approximately 4.0 points due to the closure of tax years by expiration of the statute of limitations and audit settlements as well as 1.7 points due to tax refunds. These benefits were partially offset by the repatriation of international earnings, which increased the rate by approximately 3.1 points, and the tax impact associated with our restructuring charges due to the lower weighted average effective tax rate of subsidiaries incurring the charges. 28 Table of Contents SEGMENT REVIEW Below is an analysis of the key factors affecting revenue and operating profit by reportable segment for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2008.

Certain planned global expenses are allocated to our business segments primarily based on planned revenue. The unallocated costs remain as global and other expenses. We do not allocate costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to our global functions to our segments. Costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to a specific segment are recorded within that segment. 2008 2007 % Change 2007 2006 % Change Total global expenses $ 534.5 $ 552.6 3 % $ 552.6 $ 463.6 (19 )% Allocated to segments (382.3 ) (332.8 ) 15 % (332.8 ) (308.8 ) 8 % Net global expenses $ 152.2 $ 219.8 31 % $ 219.8 $ 154.8 (42 )% The increase in the amount allocated to the segments in 2008 was primarily due to higher global marketing and research and development costs, higher information technology costs and higher costs related to global initiatives. The decrease in net global expenses was primarily due to lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives and lower professional service fees associated with our PLS initiative. The increase in the amount allocated to the segments in 2007 was primarily due to higher global marketing costs, reflecting increased spending for market research, research and development, and advertising. The increase in net global expenses in 2007 was primarily due to higher costs related to global initiatives, higher information technology costs and higher performance based compensation expense. Latin America 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 3,884.1 $ 3,298.9 18 % 14 % Operating profit 690.3 483.1 43 % 38 % Operating margin 17.8 % 14.6 % 3.2 3.0 Units sold 4 % Active Representatives 6 % Total revenue increased for 2008, driven by a larger average order and growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Growth in Active Representatives reflects significant investments in RVP and a continued high level of investment in advertising. Revenue for 2008 benefited from continued growth in substantially all markets. In particular, during 2008, revenue grew 24% in Brazil, 36% in Venezuela, 5% in Mexico and 3% in 29 Table of Contents Colombia. Revenue growth in Brazil was driven by higher average order, growth in Active Representatives and the impact of foreign exchange. Revenue growth in Venezuela was driven by higher average order, while revenue in Mexico benefited from growth in Active Representatives. We have experienced a deceleration of growth in Colombia during the second half of 2008 due to economic conditions as well as competition. The increase in operating margin in Latin America for 2008 was primarily due to the impact of higher revenues, increased pricing, lower inventory obsolescence expense, and lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives. These benefits to margin were partially offset by higher investments in RVP. Operating margin for 2007 benefited from the recognition of unclaimed sales related tax credits. Currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government in 2003 have impacted the ability of our subsidiary in Venezuela (Avon Venezuela) to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products. Unless official foreign exchange is made more readily available, Avon Venezuelas operations will continue to be negatively impacted as it will need to obtain more of its foreign currency needs from non government sources where the exchange rate is less favorable than the official rate. At December 31, 2008, Avon Venezuela had cash balances of approximately $120, primarily denominated in bolivars. During 2007, Avon Venezuela remitted dividends of approximately $40 at the official exchange rate. Avon Venezuela continues to receive official foreign exchange for some of its imports and other remittances. We continue to use the official rate to translate the financial statements of Avon Venezuela into U.S. dollars. During 2008, Avon Venezuelas revenue and operating profit represented approximately 4% and 8% of consolidated revenue and consolidated operating profit, respectively. Inflation in Venezuela has continued to increase over the past few years and it is possible that Venezuela will be designated as a highly inflationary economy during 2009. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. If Venezuela is designated as a highly inflationary economy and there is a devaluation of the official rate, earnings will be negatively impacted. For example, based on the balance sheet of our Venezuelan subsidiary at December 31, 2008, if Venezuela is designated as a highly inflationary economy and there is a 20% devaluation, our pre tax earnings would be negatively impacted by approximately $30. Additionally, revenue and operating profit on an ongoing basis would be impacted by the devaluation. Latin America 2007 Compared to 2006 %/Point Change 2007 2006 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 3,298.9 $ 2,743.4 20 % 13 % Operating profit 483.1 424.0 14 % 3 % Operating margin 14.6 % 15.5 % (.9 ) (1.3 ) Units sold 9 % Active Representatives 8 % Total revenue increased during 2007, driven by growth in Active Representatives, reflecting significant investments in advertising and RVP, and a larger average order, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue for 2007 benefited from growth in most markets, particularly from growth of approximately 30% in each of Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Revenue growth in Brazil for 2007 was driven by increases in both average order and Active Representatives, primarily due to significant investments in advertising and RVP, recruiting advertising and field incentives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue in Mexico was flat in 2007, as a mid single digit increase in Active Representatives was offset by a lower average order. The increase in Active Representatives in Mexico primarily reflects strengthened training and incentives and the retraining of our zone managers in field fundamentals. The lower average order was mainly due to product mix and a higher share of sales from new Representatives. The decrease in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by higher spending on advertising and RVP and an unfavorable mix of products sold. These higher costs were partially offset by the impact of higher revenue, lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which positively impacted operating margin by .8 point, savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives, and the recognition of unclaimed sales related tax credits. 30 Table of Contents North America 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 2,492.7 $ 2,622.1 (5 )% (5 )% Operating profit 213.9 213.1 0 % 1 % Operating margin 8.6 % 8.1 % .5 .5 Units sold (4 )% Active Representatives 2 % North America consists largely of Avons U.S. business. Revenue for 2008 was impacted by the macroeconomic environment, including deteriorating consumer confidence and higher year over year fuel prices. Sales of non Beauty products declined 9% in 2008, consistent with the general retail environment. Sales of Beauty products declined 1% in 2008. Given the economic environment, we expect these trends to continue. Total revenue decreased for 2008, as the lower average order received from Representatives more than offset an increase in Active Representatives. Growth in Active Representatives benefited from continued investments in RVP, including more frequent brochure distribution in Canada, and recruiting advertising. The decline in average order was in large part due to customer demand for non beauty products slowing markedly in this recessionary environment. The increase in operating margin for 2008 was primarily driven by lower obsolescence and overhead expenses. These benefits to operating margin were partially offset by higher variable selling costs, including paper for the brochure, bad debt and transportation, and the impact of lower revenue.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we began to see decelerating trends in non Beauty, particularly in accessories and apparel, driven by the negative impact of rising gas prices, as well as softness in the U.S. retail sector, which negatively impacted average order. The increase in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which positively impacted operating margin by 1.9 points, savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives and supply chain efficiencies. These benefits to operating margin were partially offset by higher inventory obsolescence expense, higher spending on advertising and RVP, and costs related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. 31 Table of Contents Central & Eastern Europe 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,719.5 $ 1,577.8 9 % 4 % Operating profit 346.2 296.1 17 % 11 % Operating margin 20.1 % 18.8 % 1.3 1.1 Units sold 2 % Active Representatives 12 % Beginning at the end of June 2007, we provided our Representatives with additional selling opportunities through more frequent brochure distribution, which encourages more frequent customer contact. Active representative growth during the first half of 2008 benefited from the increased brochure distribution frequency. Total revenue increased for 2008, reflecting growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a lower average order. Average order was impacted by a lower average order during the first half of 2008 as our Representatives transitioned to the shorter selling cycle. Average order during the second half of 2008 declined to a much lesser degree as compared to the first half of 2008. For 2008, the regions revenue growth benefited from increases in Russia of 8%, as well as growth in other markets in the region, led by Ukraine with growth of over 20%. The revenue increase in Russia for 2008 was primarily due to strong growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. We completed the roll out of Sales Leadership and improved the discount structure we offer Representatives in Russia near the end of the third quarter of 2008. The increase in operating margin for 2008 was primarily driven by the impact of higher revenue, lower inventory obsolescence expense and increased pricing, partially offset by higher spending on RVP and advertising, and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange on product cost.

Active Representative growth for 2007 benefited from additional selling opportunities that we provided to our Representatives through more frequent brochure distribution beginning at the end of June 2007, which encourages more frequent customer contact. The regions revenue growth in 2007 was primarily driven by Russia, as well as growth in all markets in the region. Revenue in Russia increased over 20% for 2007 due to strong Active Representative growth, which benefited from the additional selling opportunities, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue in Russia for 2007 also benefited from increased advertising, continued merchandising improvements, and the launch of Hello Tomorrow. The decrease in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by higher inventory obsolescence expense, higher spending on advertising and RVP, partially offset by lower product costs due to favorable foreign exchange movements and the impact of higher revenue. 32 Table of Contents Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 1,351.7 $ 1,308.6 3 % 6 % Operating profit 121.0 33.9 * * Operating margin 8.9 % 2.6 % 6.3 6.8 Units sold (3 )% Active Representatives 4 % * Calculation not meaningful Total revenue increased for 2008 due to growth in Active Representatives and a higher average order, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.

Revenue in the United Kingdom in local currency increased, driven by an increase in Active Representatives, benefiting from investments in representative recruiting. Revenue in the United Kingdom also benefited from the continued roll out of PLS and strong merchandising. Revenue growth in Turkey of 8% for 2008 was due to a larger average order. Revenue in Turkey also benefited from continued high levels of investments in advertising and RVP. Revenue in Italy in 2008 increased due to growth in Active Representatives. The increase in operating margin for 2008 was primarily driven by lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives, the impact of higher revenue, lower inventory obsolescence expense, lower overhead expenses and increased pricing.

Revenue growth in the U.K. of over 10% in 2007 benefited from growth in Active Representatives, mainly due to the strength of the Sales Leadership program, and favorable foreign exchange. Revenue in Turkey and the U.K. also benefited from new product launches and significant investments in advertising and RVP. Operating margin for 2006 was suppressed by 1.9 points due to $21.0 of expense associated with the resolution of a value added tax dispute in the U.K. in the third quarter of 2006. The increase in operating margin for 2007 was also driven by lower product costs due to favorable foreign exchange movements and savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives. These benefits to operating margin were partially offset by higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which negatively impacted operating margin by 1.1 points in 2007, higher spending on advertising and RVP and higher inventory obsolescence expense. 33 Table of Contents Asia Pacific 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 891.2 $ 850.8 5 % 0 % Operating profit 102.4 64.3 59 % 54 % Operating margin 11.5 % 7.6 % 3.9 4.0 Units sold 0 % Active Representatives 4 % Total revenue increased for 2008 due to foreign exchange. Revenue growth in the Philippines of almost 20%, was primarily due to growth in Active Representatives, supported by RVP initiatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Revenue in Japan increased slightly due to foreign exchange. Revenue in Japan in local currency declined in 2008 due to lower sales from both direct mail and direct selling. We expect to continue to see downward pressure in Japan going forward. Revenue in Taiwan declined in 2008, reflecting the impact of a field restructuring and economic weakness, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Operating margin increased for 2008, primarily due to the impact of lower inventory obsolescence expense, increased pricing and lower overhead expenses, partially offset by higher spending on RVP and an unfavorable mix of products sold.

Revenue in Japan declined mid single digits for 2007, reflecting weak performance in skin care. In Japan, lower sales from direct mailing were partially offset by a modest increase in sales from direct selling. While less than the overall revenue decline in the beauty market, revenue in Taiwan declined due to economic weakness. The increase in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives, which positively impacted operating margin by 2.2 points. Additionally, the operating margin improvement was due to lower inventory obsolescence expense and savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives, partially offset by higher spending on RVP and advertising and unfavorable category and country mixes of products sold. 34 Table of Contents China 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ LocalCurrency Total revenue $ 350.9 $ 280.5 25 % 14 % Operating profit 17.7 2.0 * * Operating margin 5.0 % .7 % 4.3 4.1 Units sold 2 % Active Representatives 79 % * Calculation not meaningful Revenue in China increased for 2008, primarily due to an increase in Active Representatives, partially offset by a lower average order. The growth in Active Representatives reflected continued expansion of our direct selling efforts, which were supported with significant Representative recruiting, television advertising and field incentives. The lower average order resulted from the continued expansion of direct selling, as Representatives order in smaller quantities than beauty boutiques, and orders from new Representatives tend to be smaller than the average direct selling order. Beauty boutique ordering activity levels have remained steady during this extended period of direct selling expansion, as our beauty boutique operators continue to service our Representatives. The results in China for 2008 were negatively impacted by the earthquake and subsequent flooding that occurred during the second quarter of 2008. The increase in operating margin for 2008 was primarily driven by the impact of higher revenue and lower product costs, partially offset by ongoing higher spending on RVP and advertising and costs associated with the 2008 earthquake and floods. Operating margin for 2007 benefited from higher reductions in reserves for statutory liabilities.

Active Representatives increased significantly in 2007 due to Representative recruiting, as well as the absence of a meaningful base comparison for the first half of 2006. The lower average order was mainly due to a higher share of sales from new Representatives. At the same time that we have been building on direct selling, we have seen ordering activity levels maintained by our beauty boutiques as they continue to engage in direct selling by servicing our Representatives. Additionally, the number of beauty boutiques has remained stable over the last year. Revenue in 2007 benefited from representative recruiting and continued significant investments in advertising. The increase in operating margin for 2007 was primarily driven by the impact of higher revenue and a reduction of a reserve for statutory liabilities. These positive impacts were partially offset by ongoing higher spending on RVP and fees paid to registered service centers for providing services to our Active Representatives. 35 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, commercial paper and borrowings under lines of credit. We currently believe that existing cash, cash from operations (including the impacts of cash required for restructuring initiatives) and available sources of public and private financing are adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, dividends, capital expenditures, the share repurchase program, possible acquisitions and other cash needs in the short and long term. We may, from time to time, seek to repurchase our equity in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to derivative instruments or otherwise. During 2008, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $172. Retirements of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. We may also elect to incur additional debt or issue equity or convertible securities to finance ongoing operations, acquisitions or to meet our other liquidity needs. Any issuances of equity securities or convertible securities could have a dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our current shareholders and may adversely impact earnings per share in future periods. Our liquidity could also be impacted by dividends, capital expenditures and acquisitions. At any given time, we may be in the process of discussing and negotiating an acquisition. An acquisition may be accretive or dilutive and by its nature, involve numerous risks and uncertainties. See our Cautionary Statement for purposes of the Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While recent turmoil in global financial markets has limited access to capital for many companies, in 2008 we did not experience any limitations in issuing commercial paper, reflecting our investment grade credit rating (Standard and Poors rating of single A and Moodys rating of A2). In addition, our commercial paper program is fully supported by a revolving line of credit, which is described below under Capital Resources. Management is not aware of any issues currently impacting our lenders ability to honor their commitment to extend credit under the revolving line of credit. It is unclear the extent to which this credit crisis will persist and what overall impact it may have on Avon.

These cash inflows were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the accounts payable balance, additional payments of value added taxes due to a tax law change in Brazil that we began to recover during the fourth quarter of 2008, higher incentive based compensation payments in 2008 related to our 2006 2007 Turnaround Incentive Plan and a payment of $38.0 upon settlement of treasury lock agreements associated with our $500 debt issuance during the first quarter of 2008. Inventory levels decreased during 2008, to $1,007.9 at December 31, 2008, from $1,041.8 at December 31, 2007, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by business growth and revenue declines in North America. New inventory life cycle management processes leveraged with initiatives such as PLS, SSI, ERP implementation and the Sales and Operations Planning process are expected to improve inventory levels in the long term. Inventory days are down three days in 2008 as compared to 2007, and we expect our initiatives to help us deliver improvements of three to five inventory day reductions per year for the next three to four years. 36 Table of Contents We maintain defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans (see Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans). Our funding policy for these plans is based on legal requirements and cash flows. The amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Estimates). The future funding for these plans will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of associates electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. Based on current assumptions, we expect to make contributions in the range of $60 to $100 to our U.S. pension plans and in the range of $20 to $30 to our international pension plans during 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $206.3 during 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to higher payments for inventory purchases, higher incentive based compensation payments in 2007 for compensation earned in 2006 and higher interest payments, partially offset by lower payments associated with restructuring initiatives. Net Cash Used by Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities during 2008 was $116.2 higher than 2007, primarily due to higher capital expenditures. 2007 included a payment associated with an acquisition of a licensee in Egypt. Capital expenditures during 2008 were $380.5 compared with $278.5 in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by capital spending in 2008 for the construction of new distribution facilities in North America and Latin America, and information systems (including the continued development of the ERP system). Plant construction, expansion and modernization projects were in progress at December 31, 2008, with an estimated cost to complete of approximately $430. Capital expenditures in 2009 are currently expected to be in the range of $325 to $375 and will be funded by cash from operations. These expenditures will include investments for capacity expansion, modernization of existing facilities, continued construction of new distribution facilities in North America and Latin America and information systems. Net cash used by investing activities in 2007 was $79.3 higher than in 2006 resulting from higher capital expenditures during 2007, and from payments associated with an acquisition of a licensee in Egypt during 2007, partially offset by the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in our two joint venture subsidiaries in China for approximately $39 during 2006. Capital expenditures during 2007 were $278.5 compared with $174.8 in 2006. The increase in capital spending was primarily driven by spending in 2007 for capacity expansion, the construction of a new distribution facility in North America and information systems (including the continued development of the ERP system). Net Cash Used by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities during 2008 was $455.6 lower than during 2007, primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock during 2008. Net cash used by financing activities in 2007 was $106.7 higher than in 2006, mainly driven by higher repurchases of common stock during 2007, partially offset by higher short term borrowings and higher proceeds from stock option exercises during 2007. We purchased approximately 4.6 million shares of Avon common stock for $172.1 during 2008, as compared to approximately 17.3 million shares of Avon common stock for $666.8 during 2007 and approximately 11.6 million shares of Avon common stock for $355.1 during 2006, under our previously announced share repurchase programs and through acquisition of stock from employees in connection with tax payments upon vesting of restricted stock units. In October 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $2,000.0 of our common stock over a five year period, which began in December 2007. We increased our quarterly dividend payments to $.20 per share in 2008 from $.185 per share in 2007. In February 2009, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $.21 per share. 37 Table of Contents Debt and Contractual Financial Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2008, our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014andBeyond Total Short term debt $ 1,027.1 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,027.1 Long term debt 500.0 375.0 500.0 1,375.0 Capital lease obligations 4.3 4.3 2.8 2.5 0.8 14.7 Total debt 1,031.4 4.3 502.8 2.5 375.8 500.0 2,416.8 Debt related interest 90.7 68.9 55.8 42.8 33.8 63.0 355.0 Total debt related 1,122.1 73.2 558.6 45.3 409.6 563.0 2,771.8 Operating leases 87.9 61.6 42.7 21.8 17.0 45.6 276.6 Purchase obligations 106.3 55.3 25.8 17.7 16.1 49.9 271.1 Benefit obligations (1) 77.4 13.9 11.6 10.4 11.3 50.4 175.0 Total debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments (2) $ 1,393.7 $ 204.0 $ 638.7 $ 95.2 $ 454.0 $ 708.9 $ 3,494.5 (1) Amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as expected contributions for 2009 to our funded pension benefit plans. (2) The amount of debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments excludes amounts due pursuant to derivative transactions. The table also excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding, are generally consistent from year to year, and are short term in nature. The table does not include any reserves for income taxes under FIN 48 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. At December 31, 2008, our reserves for income taxes, including interest and penalties, totaled $118.3. See Note 4, Debt and Other Financing, and Note 13, Leases and Commitments, for further information on our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives, we have a remaining liability of $93.9 at December 31, 2008, associated with the restructuring charges recorded to date, and we also expect to record additional restructuring charges of $21.9 in future periods to implement the actions approved to date. The significant majority of these liabilities will require cash payments during 2009. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2008, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements. Capital Resources We have a five year, $1,000.0 revolving credit and competitive advance facility (the credit facility), which expires in January 2011. The credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime or 1/2% plus the federal funds rate. The credit facility has an annual fee of $.7, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains various covenants, including a financial covenant which requires Avons interest coverage ratio (determined in relation to our consolidated pretax income and interest expense) to equal or exceed 4:1. The credit facility also provides for possible increases by up to an aggregate incremental principal amount of $250.0, subject to the consent of the affected lenders under the credit facility. At December 31, 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. We have a $1,000.0 commercial paper program. Under this program, we may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws, for a cumulative face amount not to exceed $1,000.0 outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment. The commercial paper program is supported by our credit facility. Outstanding commercial paper effectively reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility. At December 31, 2008, we had commercial paper outstanding of $499.7. We have a Japanese yen 11 billion ($122.0 at the exchange rate on December 31, 2008) uncommitted credit facility (yen credit facility), which expires in August 2009. Borrowings under the yen credit facility bear interest at the yen 38 Table of Contents LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The yen credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2008, $102.0 (Japanese yen 9.2 billion) was outstanding under the yen credit facility. In March 2008, we issued $500.0 principal amount of notes payable in a public offering. $250.0 of the notes bear interest at a per annum coupon rate equal to 4.8%, payable semi annually, and mature on March 1, 2013, unless redeemed prior to maturity (the 2013 Notes). $250.0 of the notes bear interest at a per annum coupon rate of 5.75%, payable semi annually, and mature on March 1, 2018, unless redeemed prior to maturity (the 2018 Notes). The net proceeds from the offering of $496.3 were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. In August 2007, we entered into treasury lock agreements (the locks) with notional amounts totaling $500.0 designated as cash flow hedges of the anticipated interest payments on $250.0 principal amount of the 2013 Notes and $250.0 principal amount of the 2018 Notes. The losses on the locks of $38.0 were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. $19.2 and $18.8 of the losses are being amortized to interest expense over five years and ten years, respectively. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants in our indentures (see Note 4, Debt and Other Financing). Such indentures do not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt. However, we would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2013 Notes and 2018 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change in control involving Avon and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities. We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means. Since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and forecasted transactions, we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives. The master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in certain circumstances, including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of Avon prior to the merger. Interest Rate Risk Our long term, fixed rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. We use interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the fixed rate on the debt to a floating interest rate, to manage our interest rate exposure. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 50% and 30% of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR, respectively. Avons total exposure to floating interest rates at December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, was approximately 65% and 60%, respectively. Our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at December 31, 2008, a hypothetical 50 basis point change (either an increase or a decrease) in interest rates prevailing at that date, sustained for one year, would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt. Foreign Currency Risk We operate globally, with operations in various locations around the world. Over the past three years, approximately 75% to 80% of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. The functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency. We are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations, primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities. At December 31, 2008, the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Colombian peso, the Euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Ukrainian hryvna and Venezuelan bolivar. 39 Table of Contents We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to, and, therefore, cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. Based on our foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2008, the impact of a hypothetical 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. The hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at December 31, 2008, adjusted for an assumed 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these hedging contracts. Credit Risk of Financial Instruments We attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements only with major international financial institutions with A or higher credit ratings as issued by Standard & Poors Corporation. Our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts, swaps or options with major international financial institutions. Although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments, we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses, if any, would not be material. Non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a write off of $111.8 at December 31, 2008. In addition, in the event of non performance by such counterparties, we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
