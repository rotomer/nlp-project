ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. When used in this discussion, the terms Avon, Company, we, our or us mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries. Refer to the Key Performance Indicators table on page 24 of this 2009 Annual Report for a description of how Constant dollar (Constant $) growth rates (a Non GAAP financial measure) are determined. Overview We are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Our business is conducted worldwide, primarily in the direct selling channel. We presently have sales operations in 65 countries and territories, including the U.S., and distribute products in 40 more. Our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in six regions: Latin America; North America; Central & Eastern Europe; Western Europe, Middle East & Africa; Asia Pacific; and China. We have centralized operations for Global Brand Marketing, Global Sales and Supply Chain. Our product categories are Beauty, Fashion and Home. Beauty consists of color cosmetics, fragrances, skin care and personal care. Fashion consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear and accessories. Home consists of gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure products and childrens and nutritional products. Sales from Health and Wellness products and mark., a global cosmetics brand that focuses on the market for young women, are included among these three categories based on product type. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by approximately 6.2 million active independent Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. The success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting, retaining and servicing our Representatives. We view the geographic diversity of our businesses as a strategic advantage in part because it allows us to participate in higher growth beauty markets internationally. In developed markets, such as the U.S., we seek to achieve growth in line with that of the overall beauty market, while in developing and emerging markets, we seek to achieve higher growth targets. During 2009, approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside the U.S. At the end of 2005, we launched a comprehensive, multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth. We have approved and announced all of the initiatives of the restructuring program launched in 2005 under the turnaround plan (2005 Restructuring Program). In 2007, we completed the analysis of our optimal product portfolio and made decisions on exit strategies for non optimal products under our Product Line Simplification program (PLS). In 2007, we also launched our Strategic Sourcing Initiative (SSI). We expect our restructuring initiatives under our 2005 Restructuring Program to deliver annualized savings of approximately $430 once all initiatives are fully implemented by 2011 2012. We also expect to achieve annualized benefits in excess of $200 from PLS and $250 from SSI in 2010. In February 2009, we announced a new restructuring program (2009 Restructuring Program) under our multi year turnaround plan, which targets increasing levels of efficiency and organizational effectiveness across our global operations. We expect the restructuring initiatives under our 2009 Restructuring Program to deliver annualized savings of approximately $200 once all initiatives are fully implemented by 2012 2013. These initiatives and programs are discussed further below. Whenever we refer to annualized savings or annualized benefits, we mean the additional operating profit we expect to realize on a full year basis every year following implementation of the respective initiative as compared with the operating profit we would have expected to achieve without having implemented the initiative. During 2009, revenue decreased 3%, impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange and the depressed global economy. Constant $ revenue increased 6%, with increases in all segments except North America and China. Sales from products in the Beauty category decreased 3%, due to unfavorable foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, sales of products in the Beauty category increased 7% due to a 4% increase in units and a 3% increase in net per unit. Active Representatives increased 9%. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange lowered operating margin by an estimated 2.5 points (approximately 2 points from foreign exchange transactions and approximately 0.5 points from foreign exchange translation), year over year. See the Segment Review section of this MD&A for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment. Although we expect that the global economic pressures will continue in the foreseeable future, we expect at least mid single digit Constant $ revenue growth during 2010. 20 Table of Contents Our 2010 operating margin will be negatively impacted by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency coupled with a required change to account for operations in Venezuela on a highly inflationary basis. As a result of the devaluation, we expect the Companys operating margin to be negatively impacted by approximately $85 of costs associated with the historical cost in U.S. dollars of non monetary assets. Refer to further discussion of Venezuela on page 31 of this 2009 Annual Report. Despite the negative impact of the accounting cost from the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, we anticipate the Companys operating margin to improve in 2010 and to reach mid teen levels by 2013. We believe that our strong operating cash flow and global cash balances of approximately $1.3 billion, coupled with the continuing execution of our turnaround strategies and the competitive advantages of our direct selling business model, will allow us to continue our focus on long term sustainable, profitable growth. We are also focused on innovating our direct selling channel through technological and service model enhancements for our Representatives and assessing new product category opportunities. We also continue to offer an increased assortment of smart value products, which are quality products at affordable price points, and promote our Representative earnings opportunity to a wider audience. Strategic Initiatives At the end of 2005, we launched a comprehensive, multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth. As part of the turnaround plan, we launched our PLS and SSI Programs. Since 2005, we have identified, and in many case implemented, restructuring initiatives under our 2005 and 2009 Restructuring Programs. We continue to implement certain initiatives under these restructuring programs. The anticipated savings or benefits realized from these initiatives has funded and will continue to fund our investment in, amongst other things, advertising, market intelligence, consumer research and product innovation. Advertising and Representative Value Proposition (RVP) Investing in advertising is a key strategy. Although we significantly increased spending on advertising over the past three years, during 2009, our investment in advertising decreased by $38 or 10% reflecting improved productivity, general softness in media prices and the benefit of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of Beauty sales, our investment in advertising was flat compared to 2008. The advertising investments supported new product launches, such as, Anew Reversalist Serum/Cream, Anew Dermafull Helix, Spectra Lash mascara, SpectraColor Lip, 24 K Gold Lipstick, Supercurlacious Mascara and Spotlight fragrance. Advertising investments also included advertising to recruit Representatives. We have also continued to forge alliances with celebrities, including alliances with Patrick Dempsey and Reese Witherspoon for her In Bloom fragrance. We continued to invest in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our Representatives. We have committed significant investments for extensive research to determine the payback on advertising and field tools and actions, and the optimal balance of these tools and actions in our markets. We have allocated these significant investments in proprietary direct selling analytics to better understand the drivers of value for our Representatives. We measure our investment in RVP as the incremental cost to provide these value enhancing initiatives. During 2009, we invested approximately $56 incrementally in our Representatives through RVP by continued implementation of our Sales Leadership program, enhanced incentives, increased sales campaign frequency, improved commissions and new e business tools. Investing in RVP will continue to be a key strategy. We will continue to look for ways to improve the earnings opportunity for Representatives through various means, including the following: Evaluating optimum discount structures in select markets; Continuing the roll out of our Sales Leadership Program, which offers Representatives an enhanced career opportunity; Strategically examining the fee structure and brochure costs to enhance Representative economics; Recalibrating the frequency of campaigns to maximize Representative selling opportunities; Applying the optimal balance of advertising and field investment in our key markets; and Web enablement for Representatives including on line training enhancements. While the reward and effort will be different within our global portfolio of businesses, we believe that web enablement is a key element to reduce Representative effort worldwide. We will continue to focus on improving Internet based tools for our Representatives. 21 Table of Contents Product Line Simplification During 2006, we began to analyze our product line, under our PLS program, to develop a smaller range of better performing, more profitable products. The continued goal of PLS is to identify an improved product assortment to drive higher sales of more profitable products. During 2007, we completed the analysis of our product portfolio, concluded on the appropriate product assortment going forward and made decisions regarding the ultimate disposition of products that will no longer be part of our improved product assortment (such as selling at a discount, donation, or destruction). During 2007, we recorded PLS charges of $187.8, primarily for incremental inventory obsolescence expense of $167.3. Although the PLS program is ongoing, we recorded final PLS charges in the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales and marketing benefits have and will continue to account for most of our projected benefits. Improving our product assortment will allow us to increase exposure and improve presentation of the remaining products within our brochure, which is expected to yield more pleasurable consumer shopping experiences, easier Representative selling experiences, and greater sales per brochure page. A second source of benefits from PLS results from transferable demand. Transferable demand refers to the concept that when products with redundant characteristics are removed from our product assortment, some demand from the eliminated products will transfer to the remaining products that offer similar or comparable product characteristics. As part of PLS, when we identify products that have sufficient overlap of characteristics, we will eliminate the products with the lowest profitability and we expect the products that we retain will generate more profit. A third source of benefits from PLS is less price discounting. As we implement operating procedures under PLS, we anticipate introducing fewer new products and lengthening the lifecycle of products in our offering, which we expect will lead to less aggressive price discounting over a products life cycle. In addition to the benefits above, we also expect supply chain benefits to account for some of our projected benefits. We expect improvements to cost of sales once PLS is fully implemented, primarily from a reduction in inventory obsolescence expense as a result of better managed inventory levels, lower variable spending on warehousing, more efficient manufacturing utilization and lower purchasing costs. We also expect operating expenses to benefit from a reduction in distribution costs and benefits to inventory productivity. Given the nature of these benefits, we estimate that we realized our targeted total benefits from this program of approximately $40 during 2008 and approximately $120 in 2009, or incremental benefits of approximately $80 over 2008. We expect to realize targeted benefits in excess of $200 in 2010. Strategic Sourcing Initiative We launched SSI in 2007. This initiative is expected to reduce direct and indirect costs of materials, goods and services. Under this initiative, we are shifting our purchasing strategy from a local, commodity oriented approach towards a globally coordinated effort which leverages our volumes, allows our suppliers to benefit from economies of scale, utilizes sourcing best practices and processes, and better matches our suppliers capabilities with our needs. Beyond lower costs, our goals from SSI include improving asset management, service for Representatives and vendor relationships. During 2008, we realized benefits of approximately $135 from SSI. During 2009, we realized approximately $200 of benefits from SSI, or incremental benefits of approximately $65 over 2008. We expect to realize benefits in excess of $250 in 2010. We continue to implement a Sales and Operations Planning process that is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues. Enterprise Resource Planning System We are in the midst of a multi year global roll out of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which is expected to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes. We began our gradual global roll out in Europe in 2005 and have since implemented ERP in our European manufacturing facilities, our larger European direct selling operations and in the U.S. As part of this continuing global roll out, we expect to implement ERP in several countries over the next several years leveraging the knowledge gained from our previous implementations. During 2008, we worked to improve the effectiveness of ERP in the U.S. and began to implement in the other markets within North America, as well as in some smaller European direct selling operations. During 2008, we also began the multi year implementation process in Latin America in one market. In Latin America, we plan to implement modules of ERP in a gradual manner across key markets over the next several years. During 2009, we began delivering on the ERP implementation in Latin America, with implementation of ERP modules in Mexico and Brazil. During 2010, we will continue the implementation in a gradual manner across key markets within the region. 22 Table of Contents Zero Overhead Growth We have institutionalized a zero overhead growth philosophy that aims to offset inflation through productivity improvements. These improvements in productivity will come primarily from SSI and our restructuring initiatives. We have defined overhead as fixed expenses such as costs associated with our sales and marketing infrastructure, and management and administrative activities. Overhead excludes variable expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses, such as shipping and handling costs and bonuses to our employees in the sales organization, and also excludes consumer and strategic investments that are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, such as advertising, RVP, research and development and brochure costs. Restructuring Initiatives 2005 Restructuring Program We launched our original restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan in late 2005. We have approved and announced all of the initiatives that are part of the 2005 Restructuring Program. We expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement restructuring initiatives under this program of approximately $530 before taxes. We have recorded total costs to implement, net of adjustments, of $524.3 through December 31, 2009, ($20.1 in 2009, $60.6 in 2008, $158.3 in 2007, $228.8 in 2006 and $56.5 in 2005) for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the 2005 Restructuring Program, primarily for employee related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits, and professional service fees related to these initiatives. The costs to implement restructuring initiatives during 2005 through 2009 are associated with specific actions, including: organization realignment and downsizing in each region and global through a process called delayering, taking out layers to bring senior management closer to operations; the phased outsourcing of certain services, including certain finance, information technology, human resource and customer service processes, and the move of certain services from markets to lower cost shared service centers; the restructure of certain international direct selling operations; the realignment of certain distribution and manufacturing operations, including the realignment of certain of our North America and Latin America distribution operations; the automation of certain distribution processes; the exit of certain unprofitable operations and product lines; and the reorganization of certain functions, primarily sales related organizations. Actions implemented under these restructuring initiatives resulted in savings of approximately $300 in 2009, as compared to savings of approximately $270 in 2008. We expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately $430 once all initiatives are fully implemented by 2011 2012. We expect the savings to reach approximately $350 in 2010. 2009 Restructuring Program In February 2009, we announced a new restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan. The restructuring initiatives under the 2009 Restructuring Program focus on restructuring our global supply chain operations, realigning certain local business support functions to a more regional basis to drive increased efficiencies, and streamlining transaction related services, including selective outsourcing. We expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement these restructuring initiatives in the range of $300 to $400 before taxes under the 2009 Restructuring Program. We have recorded total costs to implement, net of adjustments, of $151.3 through December 31, 2009, for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the 2009 Restructuring Program, primarily for employee related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits, and professional service fees related to these initiatives. Actions implemented under these restructuring initiatives resulted in savings of approximately $15 in 2009. We are targeting annualized savings under the 2009 Restructuring Program of approximately $200 upon full implementation by 2012 2013. We expect the savings to reach approximately $75 in 2010. See Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives, on pages F 34 through F 38 of our 2009 Annual Report. New Accounting Standards Information relating to new accounting standards is included in Note 2, New Accounting Standards, of our consolidated financial statements contained in this 2009 Annual Report. 23 Table of Contents Key Performance Indicators Within this MD&A, we utilize the key performance indicators (KPIs) defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business. KPI Definition Growth in Active Representatives This indicator is based on the number of Representatives submitting an order in a campaign, totaled for all campaigns in the related period. This amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period, to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days (for example, holiday schedules). To determine the growth in Active Representatives, this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year. Change in Units This indicator is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period, as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year. Units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product (for example, gift with purchase or purchase with purchase), but exclude free samples. Inventory Days This indicator is equal to the number of days of cost of sales, based on the average of the preceding 12 months, covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period. Constant $ (Non GAAP Financial Measure) To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to these adjusted growth rates as Constant $ growth. We believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate. Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. Critical Accounting Estimates We believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our consolidated financial statements contained in this 2009 Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies. Restructuring Reserves We record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement. One time, involuntary benefit arrangements and disposal costs, primarily contract termination costs, are recorded when the benefits have been communicated to employees. One time, voluntary benefit arrangements are recorded when the employee accepts the offered benefit arrangement. We evaluate impairment issues if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset. We estimate the expense for our restructuring initiatives, when approved by the appropriate corporate authority, by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans. These expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits, impairment of property, plant and equipment, contract termination payments for leases, and any other qualifying exit costs. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel. Such costs represent our best estimate, but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time, including attrition rates. Estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required. 24 Table of Contents Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable Representatives contact their customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the U.S. and a two to four week duration outside the U.S. The Representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user. In general, the Representative, an independent contractor, remits a payment to us each sales campaign, which relates to the prior campaign cycle. The Representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid; however, there are circumstances where the Representative fails to make the required payment. We record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances, including selling schedules, business operations, seasonality and changing trends. Over the past three years, annual bad debt expense has been in the range of $164 to $222, or approximately 2.0% of total revenue. Bad debt expense, as a percent of revenue increased by 0.3 points in 2009 as compared to 2008, caused by an influx of new Representatives, who normally have a higher rate of default than established Representatives, as well as economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. We generally have no detailed information concerning, or any communication with, any end user of our products beyond the Representative. We have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectability of any accounts receivable balances due from the Representative to us. If the financial condition of our Representatives were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Allowances for Sales Returns We record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. Over the past three years, sales returns have been in the range of $335 to $375, or approximately 3.5% of total revenue. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies, or for other reasons, additional allowances may be required. Provisions for Inventory Obsolescence We record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. In determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence, we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision. If actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence. Annual obsolescence expense was $122.9 for 2009, $80.8 for 2008, and $280.6 for 2007. Obsolescence expense for 2007 included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of $167.3, related to our PLS program. Obsolescence expense for 2008 benefited by approximately $13 from changes in estimates to our disposition plan under our PLS program. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Expense We maintain defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S. and a portion of employees in international locations. Additionally, we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care and life insurance benefits subject to certain limitations to the majority of employees in the U.S. and in some foreign countries. See Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans, to our 2009 Annual Report for further information on our benefit plans. Pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. For 2009, the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets, including the U.S. and non U.S. plans was 7.60%, compared to 7.66% for 2008. In determining the long term rates of return, we consider the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies, historical rates of return and current economic forecasts. We evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary. The majority of our pension plan assets relate to the U.S. pension plan. The assumed rate of return for 2009 for the U.S. plan was 8%, which was based on an asset allocation of approximately 37% in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities (which are expected to earn approximately 4% to 6% in the long term) and 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 7% to 10% in the long term). Historical rates of return on the assets of the U.S. plan was 3.6% for the most recent 10 year period and 8.0% for the 20 year period. In the U.S. plan, our asset allocation policy has favored U.S. equity securities, which have returned .3% over the 10 year period and 8.4% over the 20 year period. The plan assets in the U.S. returned 24.6% in 2009 and lost 26.2% in 2008. The discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rates for our more significant plans, including our U.S. plan, were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan. 25 Table of Contents The weighted average discount rate for U.S. and non U.S. plans determined on this basis was 5.61% at December 31, 2009, and 6.11% at December 31, 2008. For the determination of the expected rate of return on assets and the discount rate, we take into consideration external actuarial advice. Our funding requirements may be impacted by regulations or interpretations thereof. Our calculations of pension, postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent on the use of assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets discussed above, rate of compensation increase of plan participants, interest cost, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, mortality rates, the number of associate retirements, the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 31, 2009, we had pretax actuarial losses and prior service credits totaling $429.5 for the U.S. plans and $279.2 for the non U.S. plans that have not yet been charged to expense. These actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity. While we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension, postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense. During 2008, the plan assets experienced significant losses, which were mostly due to unfavorable returns on equity securities. These unfavorable returns will increase pension cost in future periods. For 2010, our assumption for the expected rate of return on assets is 8.0% for our U.S. plans and 7.18% for our non U.S. plans. Our assumptions are reviewed and determined on an annual basis. A 50 basis point change (in either direction) in the expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases, would have had approximately the following effect on 2009 pension expense: Increase/(Decrease) inPension Expense 50 Basis Point Increase Decrease Rate of return on assets (5 ) 5 Discount rate (9 ) 9 Rate of compensation increase 1 (1 ) Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future, in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made. Deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. when we conclude that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Deferred taxes are provided on earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable, there remain some positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. We file income tax returns in many jurisdictions. In 2010, a number of income tax returns are scheduled to close by statute and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed. If our filing positions are ultimately upheld, it is possible that the 2010 provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments. We recognize the benefit of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. Share based Compensation All share based payments to employees are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant. We use a Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options. This model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share based compensation may differ materially in the future from historical results. 26 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies We determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable. Our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation, which, by its nature is unpredictable. We believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange transactions lowered gross margin by an estimated 1.7 points for 2009. A portion of this negative impact from foreign exchange transactions was offset through strong manufacturing productivity gains which includes benefits from SSI and strategic price increases. 2008 gross margin included benefits of approximately $13 of reduced obsolescence from changes in estimates to our disposition plan under our PLS program. Gross margin increased 2.8 points in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in inventory obsolescence provisions in 2008, which benefited gross margin by 2.0 points, and from increased pricing and favorable product mix, which benefited gross margin by 1.3 points. These benefits to gross margin were partially offset by higher commodity costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on product cost in Europe. 2007 included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of $167.3 related to our PLS program. Obsolescence expense for 2008 also benefited by approximately $13 from changes in estimates to our disposition plan under our PLS program. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $74.6 during 2009 as compared to 2008, due to higher costs incurred under our restructuring initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising costs. We recorded charges under our 2005 and 2009 Restructuring Programs of $164.7 during 2009, as compared to $57.5 during 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $276.9 during 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to the following: higher investments in RVP and advertising of approximately $105; higher variable expenses such as freight from increased sales volume and brochure costs; higher overhead primarily due to higher marketing costs; and the impact of foreign exchange. These higher costs during 2008 as compared to 2007 were partially offset by lower costs incurred to implement our restructuring initiatives of $99.8, due to costs associated with previously approved initiatives. See the Segment Review section of MD&A for additional information related to changes in operating margin by segment. Other Expenses Interest expense increased by 4% in 2009 as compared to 2008, due to increased borrowings, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest expense decreased by 11% in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower domestic interest rates. At December 31, 2009, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 82% of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR, as compared to 50% at December 31, 2008. Interest income decreased in both 2009 and 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates. Other expense, net for 2009 was lower than during 2008 as a result of lower foreign exchange losses. Other expense, net increased in 2008, primarily due to net foreign exchange losses in 2008, as compared to foreign exchange gains in 2007. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for 2009 was 32.2%, compared to 29.3% for 2008 and 33.0% for 2007. 28 Table of Contents The effective tax rate for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by 3.4 points from the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets primarily as a result of restructuring activities, partially offset by 2.4 points from a reduction in a foreign tax liability. The 2009 rate also included a higher tax cost associated with the repatriation of current year earnings offset by favorable changes in the earnings mix of international subsidiaries. The effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by 3.8 points due to an audit settlement, partially offset by 1.2 points from the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. The 2008 rate also benefited from changes in the earnings mix of international subsidiaries. The effective tax rate for 2007 was favorably impacted by 2.0 points due to the net release of valuation allowances, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of restructuring and PLS initiatives. 29 Table of Contents Segment Review Below is an analysis of the key factors affecting revenue and operating profit by reportable segment for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2009.

Certain planned global expenses are allocated to our business segments primarily based on planned revenue. The unallocated costs remain as global and other expenses. We do not allocate costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to our global functions to our segments. Costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to a specific segment are recorded within that segment. 2009 2008 % Change 2008 2007 % Change Total global expenses $ 577.3 $ 534.5 8 % $ 534.5 $ 552.6 3 % Allocated to segments (413.8 ) (382.3 ) 8 % (382.3 ) (332.8 ) 15 % Net global expenses $ 163.5 $ 152.2 7 % $ 152.2 $ 219.8 31 % The increase in total global expenses for 2009 was primarily attributable to higher legal and information technology related costs. The increase in amounts allocated to segments for 2009 is a result of a change in the mix of expenses which are allocated to the segments and higher global expenses. The increase in the amounts allocated to the segments in 2008 was primarily due to higher global marketing and research and development costs, higher information technology costs and higher costs related to global initiatives. The decrease in net global expenses was primarily due to lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives and lower professional service fees associated with our PLS initiative. Latin America 2009 Compared to 2008 %/Point Change 2009 2008 US$ Constant $ Total revenue $ 4,103.2 $ 3,884.1 6 % 16 % Operating profit 647.9 690.3 (6 )% 2 % Operating margin 15.8 % 17.8 % (2.0 ) (2.0 ) Units sold 6 % Active Representatives 10 % Total revenue increased for 2009 reflecting growth in Active Representatives, driven by continued investments in RVP, and a higher average order, offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Revenue increased 9% in Brazil and declined 11% in Mexico for 2009. Constant $ revenue for 2009 benefited from growth in all markets, particularly from increases of 17% in Brazil and 8% in Mexico. Revenue in Venezuela for 2009 grew 18% in both Constant $ and U.S. dollars. Revenue in Venezuela will be negatively impacted in future periods by the change in the official exchange rate discussed below. 30 Table of Contents Constant $ revenue growth in Brazil for 2009 was primarily driven by an increase in Active Representatives, as well as a higher average order. Constant $ revenue growth in Mexico for 2009 was driven by a significant increase in Active Representatives, partially offset by a lower average order, reflecting a difficult economic climate. Revenue growth in Venezuela for 2009 reflected increased prices due to inflation. The decrease in operating margin in Latin America for 2009 was primarily due to an estimated 2 point negative impact of unfavorable foreign exchange transactions, which includes the cost of our Venezuelan subsidiary settling certain U.S. dollar denominated liabilities through transactions with non government sources where the exchange rate is less favorable than the official rate (the parallel market). Additionally, higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives during 2009 negatively impacted operating margin by 0.7 points, as these costs impacted operating margin by 0.9 points in 2009 and 0.2 points in 2008. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was the benefit of higher revenues and fixed overhead expense. Currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government in 2003 have impacted the ability of our subsidiary in Venezuela (Avon Venezuela) to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products. Unless official foreign exchange is made more readily available, Avon Venezuelas operations will continue to be negatively impacted as it will need to obtain more of its foreign currency needs from the parallel market. During 2009, the exchange rate in the parallel market generally averaged from 5 to 6 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, compared to the official rate of 2.15 during 2009. At December 31, 2009, Avon Venezuela had cash balances of approximately $104 translated at the December 31, 2009 official rate, of which approximately $83 was denominated in bolivars and $21 was denominated in U.S. dollars. The last dividends repatriated to the U.S. were during 2007, when Avon Venezuela remitted dividends of approximately $40 at the official exchange rate. Avon Venezuela continues to receive official foreign exchange for some of its imports and other remittances. In 2009, we continued to use the official rate to translate the financial statements of Avon Venezuela into U.S. dollars. During 2009, Avon Venezuelas revenue and operating profit represented approximately 5% and 9% of Avons consolidated revenue and Avons consolidated operating profit, respectively. Inflation in Venezuela has been at high levels over the past few years. Avon uses the blended Consumer Price Index and National Consumer Price Index to determine whether Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy. Effective with the beginning of its 2010 fiscal year, Avon will treat Venezuela as a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. When an entity operates in a highly inflationary economy, exchange gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities and deferred income taxes resulting from changes in the exchange rate are recorded in income. Nonmonetary assets, which include inventories and property, plant and equipment, are carried forward at their historical dollar cost. Effective January 11, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure. The official exchange rate moved from 2.15 to 2.60 for essential goods and to 4.30 for non essential goods and services. Although no official rules have yet been issued, most of Avons imports are expected to fall into the non essential classification. As a result of the change in the official rate to 4.30, Avon anticipates it will record a one time, after tax loss of approximately $50 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting the write down of monetary assets and deferred tax benefits. Additionally, certain nonmonetary assets are carried at historic dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation. Therefore, these costs will impact the income statement during 2010 as they will not be devalued based on the new exchange rates, but will be expensed at the historic dollar value. As a result of using the historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets acquired prior to the devaluation, such as inventory, 2010 operating profit and net income will additionally be negatively impacted by approximately $85 million, primarily during the first half of the year, for the difference between the historical cost at the previous official exchange rate of 2.15 and the new official exchange rate of 4.30. In addition, revenue and operating profit for Avons Venezuela operations will be negatively impacted when translated into dollars at the new official exchange rate. This would be partially offset by the favorable impact of any operating performance improvements. Results for periods prior to 2010 will not be impacted by the change in accounting treatment of Venezuela as a highly inflationary economy or by the change in the official rate in January of 2010. 31 Table of Contents Latin America 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ Constant $ Total revenue $ 3,884.1 $ 3,298.9 18 % 14 % Operating profit 690.3 483.1 43 % 38 % Operating margin 17.8 % 14.6 % 3.2 3.0 Units sold 4 % Active Representatives 6 % Total revenue increased for 2008, driven by a larger average order and growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. Growth in Active Representatives reflected significant investments in RVP and a continued high level of investment in advertising. Revenue for 2008 benefited from continued growth in substantially all markets. In particular, during 2008, revenue grew 24% in Brazil, 36% in Venezuela, 5% in Mexico and 3% in Colombia. Revenue growth in Brazil was driven by higher average order, growth in Active Representatives and the impact of foreign exchange. Revenue growth in Venezuela was driven by higher average order, while revenue in Mexico benefited from growth in Active Representatives. We experienced a deceleration of growth in Colombia during the second half of 2008 due to economic conditions as well as competition. The increase in operating margin in Latin America for 2008 was primarily due to the impact of higher revenues, increased pricing, lower inventory obsolescence expense, and lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives. These benefits to margin were partially offset by higher investments in RVP. Operating margin for 2007 benefited from the recognition of unclaimed sales related tax credits. North America 2009 Compared to 2008 %/Point Change 2009 2008 US$ Constant $ Total revenue $ 2,262.7 $ 2,492.7 (9 )% (9 )% Operating profit 110.4 213.9 (48 )% (48 )% Operating margin 4.9 % 8.6 % (3.7 ) (3.6 ) Units sold (7 )% Active Representatives 3 % North America consists largely of our U.S. business. Total revenue for 2009 was negatively impacted by the continued recessionary pressure, as a lower average order received from Representatives more than offset an increase in Active Representatives. Average order remains challenging, particularly in our non beauty categories. Sales of non Beauty products declined 13% in 2009, consistent with the general retail environment. Sales of Beauty products declined 6% in 2009. The growth in Active Representatives during 2009 reflected our ongoing recruiting and training efforts. Given the economic environment, we expect continued pressure on our results in North America in 2010. Higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives negatively impacted operating margin for 2009 by 1.3 points, as these costs impacted 2009 operating margin by 1.8 points as compared to 0.5 points in 2008. Lower revenues with fixed overhead expense and higher obsolescence expense also lowered operating margin in 2009. 32 Table of Contents North America 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ Constant $ Total revenue $ 2,492.7 $ 2,622.1 (5 )% (5 )% Operating profit 213.9 213.1 0 % 1 % Operating margin 8.6 % 8.1 % .5 .5 Units sold (4 )% Active Representatives 2 % North America consists largely of our U.S. business. Revenue for 2008 was impacted by the macroeconomic environment, including deteriorating consumer confidence and higher year over year fuel prices. Sales of non Beauty products declined 9% in 2008, consistent with the general retail environment. Sales of Beauty products declined 1% in 2008. Total revenue decreased for 2008, as the lower average order received from Representatives more than offset an increase in Active Representatives. Growth in Active Representatives benefited from continued investments in RVP, including more frequent brochure distribution in Canada, and recruiting advertising. The decline in average order was in large part due to customer demand for non beauty products slowing markedly in the recessionary environment. The increase in operating margin for 2008 was primarily driven by lower obsolescence and overhead expenses. These benefits to operating margin were partially offset by higher variable selling costs, including paper for the brochure, bad debt and transportation, and the impact of lower revenue.

Constant $ revenue for 2009 increased despite continued recessionary pressure throughout the region, reflecting growth in Active Representatives, driven by investments in RVP and brochures as well as strong marketing offers. While the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates drove revenue declines of 7% in Russia and 19% in Ukraine for 2009, Constant $ revenue grew 18% in Russia and 20% in Ukraine. The Constant $ revenue increase in Russia for 2009 was primarily due to strong growth in Active Representatives. In late 2008, we completed the roll out of Sales Leadership and improved the discount structure we offered Representatives in Russia. The Constant $ revenue increase in Ukraine for 2009 was primarily due to growth in Active Representatives and a higher average order due to increased pricing from inflation, partially offset by the negative impact of recent economic conditions. The decrease in operating margin for 2009 was primarily driven by the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange transactions, which negatively impacted operating margin by an estimated 5 points. Higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives negatively impacted operating margin for 2009 by 1.6 points, as these costs impacted 2009 operating margin by 1.8 points as compared to 0.2 points in 2008. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were lower advertising costs in 2009 and the benefit of higher Constant $ revenues with fixed overhead expenses. Operating margin for 2009 was also negatively impacted by higher obsolescence expense in 2009, as the 2008 period benefited from an adjustment to inventory obsolescence reserve due to changes in our estimates to our disposition plan of products reserved for under PLS. 33 Table of Contents Central & Eastern Europe 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ Constant $ Total revenue $ 1,719.5 $ 1,577.8 9 % 4 % Operating profit 346.2 296.1 17 % 11 % Operating margin 20.1 % 18.8 % 1.3 1.1 Units sold 2 % Active Representatives 12 % Beginning at the end of June 2007, we provided our Representatives with additional selling opportunities through more frequent brochure distribution, which encourages more frequent customer contact. Active representative growth during the first half of 2008 benefited from the increased brochure distribution frequency. Total revenue increased for 2008, reflecting growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a lower average order. Average order was impacted by a lower average order during the first half of 2008 as our Representatives transitioned to the shorter selling cycle. Average order during the second half of 2008 declined to a much lesser degree as compared to the first half of 2008. For 2008, the regions revenue growth benefited from increases in Russia of 8%, as well as growth in other markets in the region, led by Ukraine with growth of over 20%. The revenue increase in Russia for 2008 was primarily due to strong growth in Active Representatives, as well as favorable foreign exchange. We completed the roll out of Sales Leadership and improved the discount structure we offer Representatives in Russia near the end of the third quarter of 2008. The increase in operating margin for 2008 was primarily driven by the impact of higher revenue, lower inventory obsolescence expense and increased pricing, partially offset by higher spending on RVP and advertising, and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange on product cost.

Constant $ revenue increased for 2009 as a result of growth in Active Representatives, offset by a lower average order reflecting continued recessionary pressure. Active Representatives growth for 2009 benefited by one point due to the acquisition of a small distributor in Saudi Arabia during the second quarter of 2009. This acquisition had minimal impact on the financial results. Revenue declined 16% in the United Kingdom during 2009, due to the negative impact of foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue in the United Kingdom declined 1% during 2009, as strong merchandising of smart value products countered the recessionary pressure. Revenue in Turkey increased 2% during 2009. Turkeys Constant $ revenue increased 21% during 2009, reflecting an increase in Active Representatives, driven by investments in RVP and Sales Leadership. The decrease in operating margin for 2009 was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, including the impacts of foreign exchange transactions as well as translation, which negatively impacted operating margin by an estimated 3 points. Additionally, higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives negatively impacted operating margin by .7 points, as these costs impacted 2009 operating margin by 2.5 points as compared to 1.8 points in 2008. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were lower overhead expenses in 2009. 34 Table of Contents Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ Constant $ Total revenue $ 1,351.7 $ 1,308.6 3 % 6 % Operating profit 121.0 33.9 * * Operating margin 8.9 % 2.6 % 6.3 6.8 Units sold (3 )% Active Representatives 4 % * Calculation not meaningful Total revenue increased for 2008 due to growth in Active Representatives and a higher average order, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.

Revenue in the United Kingdom in Constant $ increased, driven by an increase in Active Representatives, benefiting from investments in representative recruiting. Revenue in the United Kingdom also benefited from the continued roll out of PLS and strong merchandising. Revenue growth in Turkey of 8% for 2008 was due to a larger average order. Revenue in Turkey also benefited from continued high levels of investments in advertising and RVP. Revenue in Italy in 2008 increased due to growth in Active Representatives. The increase in operating margin for 2008 was primarily driven by lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives, the impact of higher revenue, lower inventory obsolescence expense, lower overhead expenses and increased pricing. These benefits to operating margin were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange on product cost and higher spending on RVP and advertising.

Revenue in Japan for 2009 decreased 2%, while Constant $ revenue declined 12%, due to lower revenues from both direct mail and direct selling. We continue to see downward pressure on our results in Japan. The decrease in operating margin for 2009 was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, including the impacts of foreign exchange transactions as well as translation, which negatively impacted operating margin by an estimated 2 points. Additionally, higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives negatively impacted operating margin by 2.1 points, as these costs impacted 2009 operating margin by 2.2 points as compared to .1 points in 2008. Partially offsetting these items were the benefits of growth derived from higher margin markets. 35 Table of Contents Asia Pacific 2008 Compared to 2007 %/Point Change 2008 2007 US$ Constant $ Total revenue $ 891.2 $ 850.8 5 % 0 % Operating profit 102.4 64.3 59 % 54 % Operating margin 11.5 % 7.6 % 3.9 4.0 Units sold 0 % Active Representatives 4 % Total revenue increased for 2008 due to foreign exchange.

Revenue in Japan increased slightly due to foreign exchange. Revenue in Japan in Constant $ declined in 2008 due to lower sales from both direct mail and direct selling. Revenue in Taiwan declined in 2008, reflecting the impact of a field restructuring and economic weakness, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Operating margin increased for 2008, primarily due to the impact of lower inventory obsolescence expense, increased pricing and lower overhead expenses, partially offset by higher spending on RVP and an unfavorable mix of products sold.

Revenue from Beauty Boutiques decreased by over 40% for 2009, reflecting the continued complex evolution towards direct selling in this hybrid business model, which is unique to this market. Revenue growth from direct selling increased 24% during 2009. Our near term outlook for China remains challenged during our strategic transition. We remain optimistic about our long term revenue and operating profit opportunities. The increase in operating margin for 2009 was primarily driven by lower advertising costs and cost saving initiatives. A lower gross margin offset these operating margin benefits for 2009. Additionally, the 2008 operating margin was negatively impacted by costs associated with the 2008 earthquake and floods.

The growth in Active Representatives reflected continued expansion of our direct selling efforts, which were supported with significant Representative recruiting, television advertising and field incentives. The lower average order resulted from the continued expansion of direct selling, as Representatives order in smaller quantities than beauty boutiques, and orders from new Representatives tend to be smaller than the average direct selling order. Beauty boutique ordering activity levels have remained steady during this extended period of direct selling expansion, as our beauty boutique operators continue to service our Representatives. The increase in operating margin for 2008 was primarily driven by the impact of higher revenue and lower product costs, partially offset by ongoing higher spending on RVP and advertising and costs associated with the 2008 earthquake and floods. Operating margin for 2007 benefited from higher reductions in reserves for statutory liabilities. Liquidity And Capital Resources Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, commercial paper and borrowings under lines of credit. We currently believe that existing cash, cash from operations (including the impacts of cash required for restructuring initiatives) and available sources of public and private financing are adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, dividends, capital expenditures, the share repurchase program, possible acquisitions and other cash needs in the short and long term. We may, from time to time, seek to repurchase our equity or to retire our outstanding debt in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, derivative instruments or otherwise. During 2009, we repurchased approximately .4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.6. During 2008, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $172. Retirements of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. We may also elect to incur additional debt or issue equity or convertible securities to finance ongoing operations, acquisitions or to meet our other liquidity needs. Any issuances of equity securities or convertible securities could have a dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our current shareholders and may adversely impact earnings per share in future periods. Our liquidity could also be impacted by dividends, capital expenditures and acquisitions. At any given time, we may be in discussions and negotiations with potential acquisition candidates. Acquisitions may be accretive or dilutive and by their nature involve numerous risks and uncertainties.

Offsetting these favorable comparisons, are net unfavorable working capital movements in accounts receivable as compared to 2008 and additional payments of value added taxes in Brazil that we expect to recover in the future. Inventory levels increased during 2009, to $1,067.5 at December 31, 2009, from $1,007.9 at December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting the impact of foreign exchange and business growth offset by operational improvements. New inventory life cycle management processes leveraged with initiatives such as PLS, SSI, ERP implementation and the Sales and Operations Planning process are expected to improve inventory levels in the long term. Inventory days are up 7 days in 2009 as compared to 2008, due to the impact of foreign exchange. We expect our initiatives to help us deliver operational improvements of three to five inventory day reductions per year for the next two to three years. We maintain defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans (see Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans). Our funding policy for these plans is based on legal requirements and cash flows. The amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Estimates). The future funding for these plans will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of associates electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. Based on current assumptions, we expect to make contributions in the range of $15 to $20 to our U.S. pension plans and in the range of $30 to $40 to our international pension plans during 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was $158.3 higher than during 2007, primarily due to higher cash related net income in 2008, favorable impacts of inventory and accounts receivable balances and lower contributions to retirement related plans in 2008. These cash inflows were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the accounts payable balance, additional payments of value added taxes due to a tax law change in Brazil that we began to recover during the fourth quarter of 2008, higher incentive based compensation payments in 2008 related to our 2006 2007 Turnaround Incentive Plan and a payment of $38.0 upon settlement of treasury lock agreements associated with our $500 debt issuance during the first quarter of 2008. Net Cash from Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities during 2009 was $184.5 lower than 2008, primarily due to the redemption of certain corporate owned life insurance policies in 2009 and lower capital expenditures. Net cash used by investing activities during 2008 was $116.2 higher than 2007, primarily due to higher capital expenditures. Net cash used by investing activities during 2007 included a payment associated with an acquisition of a licensee in Egypt. Capital expenditures during 2009 were $296.9 compared with $380.5 in 2008. This decrease resulted from our efforts to preserve capital. Capital expenditures during 2008 were $380.5 compared with $278.5 in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by capital spending in 2008 for the construction of new distribution facilities in North America and Latin America, and information systems (including the continued development of the ERP system). Capital expenditures in 2010 are currently expected to be approximately $350 and will be funded by cash from operations. These expenditures will include investments for capacity expansion, modernization of existing facilities, continued construction of new distribution facilities in Latin America and information systems. Net Cash from Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities of $361.8 during 2009, compared unfavorably to cash used by financing activities of $141.5 during 2008. During 2009, we repaid $958.5 of commercial paper and other debt as compared to $290.8 during 2008. In 2009, we received proceeds from the $850 debt issuance during March 2009 as compared to a $500 debt issuance during 2008. Additionally, during 2009 we repurchased $8.6 of common stock as compared to $172.1 in 2008. 38 Table of Contents Net cash used by financing activities during 2008 was $455.6 lower than during 2007, primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock during 2008. We purchased approximately .4 million shares of our common stock for $8.6 during 2009, as compared to 4.6 million shares for $172.1 during 2008 and 17.3 million shares for $666.8 during 2007, under our previously announced share repurchase programs and through acquisition of stock from employees in connection with tax payments upon vesting of restricted stock units. In October 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $2,000.0 of our common stock over a five year period, which began in December 2007. We increased our quarterly dividend payments to $.21 per share in 2009 from $.20 per share in 2008. In February 2010, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $.22 per share. Debt and Contractual Financial Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2009, our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andBeyond Total Short term debt $ 122.8 $ $ $ $ $ $ 122.8 Long term debt 500.0 375.0 500.0 850.0 2,225.0 Capital lease obligations 15.3 11.6 12.2 5.5 5.6 37.2 87.4 Total debt 138.1 511.6 12.2 380.5 505.6 887.2 2,435.2 Debt related interest 122.5 97.6 96.2 82.2 54.4 53.7 506.6 Total debt related 260.6 609.2 108.4 462.7 560.0 940.9 2,941.8 Operating leases 92.1 63.9 47.1 21.7 15.8 37.7 278.3 Purchase obligations 163.5 70.0 59.0 38.3 34.8 17.5 383.1 Benefit obligations (1) 53.4 11.4 11.7 10.3 9.7 66.4 162.9 Total debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments (2) $ 569.6 $ 754.5 $ 226.2 $ 533.0 $ 620.3 $ 1,062.5 $ 3,766.1 (1) Amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as expected contributions for 2010 to our funded pension benefit plans. (2) The amount of debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments excludes amounts due under derivative transactions. The table also excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding, are generally consistent from year to year, and are short term in nature. The table does not include any reserves for income taxes because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. At December 31, 2009, our reserves for income taxes, including interest and penalties, totaled $133.4. See Note 4, Debt and Other Financing, and Note 13, Leases and Commitments, to our 2009 Annual Report for further information on our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives, we have a remaining liability of $149.1 at December 31, 2009, associated with the restructuring charges recorded to date under the 2005 and 2009 Restructuring Programs, and we also expect to record additional restructuring charges of $20.9 in future periods to implement the actions approved to date. The significant majority of these liabilities will require cash payments during 2010. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2009, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements. 39 Table of Contents Capital Resources We maintain a five year, $1,000.0 revolving credit and competitive advance facility (the credit facility), which expires in January 2011. The credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime or 1/2% plus the federal funds rate. The credit facility has an annual fee of $.7, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains various covenants, including a financial covenant which requires our interest coverage ratio (determined in relation to our consolidated pretax income and interest expense) to equal or exceed 4:1. The credit facility also provides for possible increases by up to an aggregate incremental principal amount of $250.0, subject to the consent of the affected lenders under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. We also maintain a $1,000.0 commercial paper program. Under this program, we may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws, for a cumulative face amount not to exceed $1,000.0 outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment. The commercial paper program is supported by our credit facility. Outstanding commercial paper effectively reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under this program. In March 2009, we issued $850.0 principal amount of notes payable in a public offering. $500.0 of the notes bear interest at a per annum coupon rate equal to 5.625%, payable semi annually, and mature on March 1, 2014, unless redeemed prior to maturity (the 2014 Notes). $350.0 of the notes bear interest at a per annum coupon rate equal to 6.500%, payable semi annually, and mature on March 1, 2019, unless redeemed prior to maturity (the 2019 Notes). The net proceeds from the offering of $837.6 were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the offering of the 2014 Notes, we entered into five year interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $500.0 to effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the 2014 Notes to a variable interest rate, based on LIBOR. In March 2008, we issued $500.0 principal amount of notes payable in a public offering. $250.0 of the notes bear interest at a per annum coupon rate equal to 4.8%, payable semi annually, and mature on March 1, 2013, unless redeemed prior to maturity (the 2013 Notes). $250.0 of the notes bear interest at a per annum coupon rate of 5.75%, payable semi annually, and mature on March 1, 2018, unless redeemed prior to maturity (the 2018 Notes). The net proceeds from the offering of $496.3 were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. In August 2007, we entered into treasury lock agreements (the locks) with notional amounts totaling $500.0 designated as cash flow hedges of the anticipated interest payments on $250.0 principal amount of the 2013 Notes and $250.0 principal amount of the 2018 Notes. The losses on the locks of $38.0 were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. $19.2 of the losses are being amortized to interest expense over five years and $18.8 are being amortized over ten years. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants in our indentures (see Note 4, Debt and Other Financing, to our 2009 Annual Report). Such indentures do not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt. However, we would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2013 Notes, 2014 Notes, 2018 Notes, and 2019 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change in control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities. We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means. Since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a portion of our existing and forecasted transactions, we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives. The master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in some circumstances, including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of Avon prior to the merger. 40 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our long term, fixed rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. We use interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the fixed rate on the long term debt to a floating interest rate, to manage our interest rate exposure. At December 31, 2009, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 82% of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR, as compared to 50% at December 31, 2008. Our total exposure to floating interest rates was 83% at December 31, 2009, and 65% at December 31, 2008. Our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at December 31, 2009, a hypothetical 50 basis point change (either an increase or a decrease) in interest rates prevailing at that date, sustained for one year, would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt. Foreign Currency Risk We operate globally, with operations in various locations around the world. Over the past three years, approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. The functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency. We are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations, primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities. At December 31, 2009, the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Colombian peso, the Euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Ukrainian hryvnia and Venezuelan bolivar. We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to, and, therefore, cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. Based on our foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2009, the impact of a hypothetical 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. The hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at December 31, 2009, adjusted for an assumed 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these hedging contracts. Credit Risk of Financial Instruments We attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements only with major international financial institutions with "A" or higher credit ratings as issued by Standard & Poors Corporation. Our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts, swaps or options with major international financial institutions. Although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments, we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses, if any, would not be material. Non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a write off of $60.0 at December 31, 2009. In addition, in the event of non performance by such counterparties, we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
