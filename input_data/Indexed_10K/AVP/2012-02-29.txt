ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. When used in this discussion, the terms Avon, Company, we, our or us mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries.Refer to the Non GAAP Financial Measures on pages 22 through 23 of this 2011 Annual Report for a description of how Constant dollar (Constant $) growth rates (a Non GAAP financial measure) are determined.OverviewWe are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Our business is conducted worldwide, primarily in the direct selling channel. We presently have sales operations in 65 countries and territories, including the U.S., and distribute products in 42 more. Our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in five regions: Latin America; North America; Central & Eastern Europe; Western Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Asia Pacific. We have centralized operations for Global Brand Marketing, Global Sales and Supply Chain. Our product categories are Beauty, Fashion and Home. Beauty consists of color cosmetics, fragrances, skin care and personal care. Fashion consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear, accessories and childrens products. Home consists of gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure products and nutritional products. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by approximately 6.4 million active independent Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. The success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting, retaining and servicing our Representatives. During 2011, approximately 83% of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside the U.S.Total revenue in 2011 increased 4%, with favorable foreign exchange contributing 3 points to the revenue increase. Constant $ revenues increased 1%. Active Representatives decreased 1%. Sales from products in the Beauty category increased 5%, or 2% on a Constant $ basis, due to a 3% increase in net per unit offset by a 1% decrease in units. We saw slower than expected growth in several markets partially attributable to weaker macro economic conditions. In Brazil, our largest market, lower than normal service levels were further impacted by the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system during the second half of the year, which weakened results. Additionally, slowing Beauty category market growth pressured Brazils results in the second half of 2011. During the latter part of 2011, we believe Russias performance was also impacted by weak trends in the Beauty category market in that country. See the Segment Review section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment.During 2011, our operating margin was negatively impacted by an impairment charge of goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset associated with our Silpada business unit which we acquired during 2010. As a result of this impairment charge, operating profit for 2011 was negatively impacted by $263.0. Please refer to Note 17, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of our 2011 Annual Report for a discussion regarding Silpada. We continue to experience increases in labor and commodity costs, including oil, silver and cotton. Our pricing strategies are helping to partially offset the resulting product cost increases but there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately.In 2011, we committed to undertake a detailed assessment of our long range business plan in order to improve our performance and better position ourselves in the increasingly complex economic environment. The review will include internal and external inputs, executional capabilities and capital allocation.We believe that our operating cash flow and global cash and cash equivalent balances will allow us to continue our focus on long term sustainable, profitable growth. We are also focused on innovating our direct selling channel through technological and service model enhancements for our Representatives.Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, the results of Asia Pacific and China were managed as a single operating segment, referred to as Asia Pacific. Accordingly, Asia Pacific amounts include the results of China for all periods presented. In December 2010, we completed the sale of our subsidiary in Japan, which has been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods.18InitiativesWe continue to implement certain initiatives under our 2005 and 2009 restructuring programs. The anticipated savings or benefits realized from these initiatives has funded and will continue to fund our investment in, amongst other things, advertising, market intelligence, consumer research and product innovation. Advertising and Representative Value Proposition (RVP)We significantly increased spending on advertising over the four years leading up to 2011. While investing in advertising remains a key strategy, during 2011 our investment in advertising decreased by $89.2 or 22% and as a percentage of Beauty sales, our investment in advertising decreased by 24% compared to 2010. The decrease in advertising in 2011 is primarily due to the shift to increased investment in RVP. The advertising investments supported new product launches, such as SuperShock Max Mascara. Moisture Seduction Lipstick, Outspoken Intense by Fergie Fragrance, Step Into Fragrance, Anew Genics Treatment Cream, Anew Solar Advance Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 45, Solutions Youth Minerals Restorative Night Cream, Super Enchant Mascara, and ExtraLasting Makeup. Advertising investments also included advertising to recruit Representatives. We also continued to build the alliances portfolio including Fergie and local celebrities in Latin America and Russia.We continued to invest in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our Representatives. We have committed significant investments for extensive research to determine the payback on advertising and field tools and actions, and the optimal balance of these tools and actions in our markets. We have allocated these significant investments in proprietary direct selling analytics to better understand the drivers of value for our Representatives. We measure our investment in RVP as the incremental cost to provide these value enhancing initiatives. During 2011, we invested approximately $121.0 incrementally in our Representatives through RVP by continued implementation of our Sales Leadership program, enhanced incentives, increased sales campaign frequency, improved commissions and new e business tools. We will continue to look for ways to improve the earnings opportunity for Representatives through various means, including the following:Evaluating optimum discount structures in select markets;Continuing the roll out of our Sales Leadership Program, which offers Representatives an enhanced career opportunity;Strategically examining the fee structure and brochure costs to enhance Representative economics;Recalibrating the frequency of campaigns to maximize Representative selling opportunities;Service Model Transformation initiatives;Applying the optimal balance of advertising and field investment in our key markets; andWeb enablement for Representatives including on line training enhancements.While the reward and effort will be different within our global portfolio of businesses, we believe that web enablement is a key element to reduce Representative effort worldwide. We will continue to focus on improving Internet based tools for our Representatives.Enterprise Resource Planning SystemWe are in the midst of a multi year global roll out of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which is expected to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes. We began our gradual global roll out in Europe in 2005 and have since implemented ERP in our European manufacturing facilities, our larger European direct selling operations and in the U.S. As part of this continuing global roll out, we expect to implement ERP in other countries over the next several years leveraging the knowledge gained from our previous implementations.During 2011, we implemented the supply chain module of ERP in Brazil. While the implementation of the ERP system and transformation of the related processes negatively impacted service levels in Brazil in the second half of 2011, we expect the ERP system to help improve our service reliability over the long term.Restructuring InitiativesWe launched restructuring programs in late 2005 ("2005 Restructuring Program") and in February 2009 ("2009 Restructuring Program"). Through December 31, 2011, we have recorded total costs to implement, net of adjustments, of $526.0 ($12.3 in 2011, $3.2 in 2010, $20.1 in 2009, $59.3 in 2008, $157.5 in 2007, $217.1 in 2006 and $56.5 in 2005) for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the 2005 Restructuring Program, primarily for employee related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits, and professional service fees related to these initiatives. Through 19December 31, 2011, we have recorded total costs to implement, net of adjustments, of $256.0 ($27.7 in 2011, $77.5 in 2010, and $150.8 in 2009) for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the 2009 Restructuring Program, primarily for employee related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits, and professional service fees related to these initiatives. See Note 15, Restructuring Initiatives, on pages F 37 through F 40 of our 2011 Annual Report for further information on these restructuring programs.New Accounting StandardsInformation relating to new accounting standards is included in Note 2, New Accounting Standards, of our consolidated financial statements contained in this 2011 Annual Report.Performance MetricsWithin this MD&A, in addition to our key financial metrics of revenue, operating profit and operating margin, we utilize the performance metrics defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business.Performance Metrics Definition Growth in Active Representatives This metric is based on the number of Representatives submitting an order in a campaign, totaled for all campaigns in the related period. This amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period, to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days (for example, holiday schedules). To determine the growth in Active Representatives, this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year. Change in Units This metric is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period, as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year. Units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product (for example, gift with purchase or purchase with purchase), but exclude free samples. Inventory Days This metric is equal to the number of days of cost of sales, based on the average of the preceding 12 months, covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period.Non GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to these adjusted growth rates as Constant $ growth, which is a non GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate. Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.We present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, operating profit, operating margin and effective tax rate on a non GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a non GAAP basis. We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non GAAP financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. These non GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the non GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period to period basis, the impacts of 1) costs to implement (CTI) restructuring initiatives, 2) goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairment charge related to Silpada ("Impairment charge"), and 3) costs and charges related to Venezuela being designated as a highly inflationary economy and the subsequent devaluation of its currency in January 2010 (Venezuelan special items). The Company believes investors find the non GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Companys financial results in any particular period. The Impairment charge includes the impact on the Statement of Income caused by the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairment charge related to Silpada in 2011. The Venezuelan special items include the impact on the Statement of Income caused by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash, receivables and payables; deferred tax assets and liabilities; and nonmonetary assets, such as inventory and prepaid expenses. For nonmonetary assets, the Venezuelan 20special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical cost of the assets at the previous official exchange rate of 2.15 and the revised official exchange rate of 4.30.Critical Accounting EstimatesWe believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our 2011 Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies.Restructuring ReservesWe record the estimated expense for our restructuring initiatives as such costs are deemed probable and estimable, when approved by the appropriate corporate authority and by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans. These expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits, impairment of property, plant and equipment, and any other qualifying exit costs. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel. Such costs represent our best estimate, but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time, including attrition rates. Estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required.Allowances for Doubtful Accounts ReceivableRepresentatives contact their customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the U.S. and a two to four week duration outside the U.S. The Representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user. In general, the Representative, an independent contractor, remits a payment to us each sales campaign, which relates to the prior campaign cycle. The Representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid; however, there are circumstances where the Representative fails to make the required payment. We record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances, including selling schedules, business operations, seasonality and changing trends. Over the past three years, annual bad debt expense has been in the range of $215 to $248, or approximately 2.0% of total revenue. Bad debt expense, as a percent of revenue increased by .2 points in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily in Latin America. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. We generally have no detailed information concerning, or any communication with, any end user of our products beyond the Representative. We have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectability of any accounts receivable balances due from the Representative to us. If the financial condition of our Representatives were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.Allowances for Sales ReturnsWe record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. Over the past three years, sales returns have been in the range of $370 to $447, or approximately 3.8% of total revenue. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies, or for other reasons, additional allowances may be required.Provisions for Inventory ObsolescenceWe record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. In determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence, we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision. If actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence. Annual obsolescence expense was $128.1 for 2011, $131.1 for 2010, and $120.0 for 2009. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment ExpenseWe maintain defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S. and a portion of employees in international locations. Additionally, we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care and life insurance benefits subject to certain limitations to the majority of employees in the U.S. and in some foreign countries. See Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans, to our 2011 Annual Report for further information on our benefit plans.21Pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, the interest crediting rate for hybrid plans and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations.For 2011, the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets, including the U.S. and non U.S. plans was 7.54%, compared to 7.65% for 2010. In determining the long term rates of return, we consider the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies, historical rates of return and current economic forecasts. We evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary.The majority of our pension plan assets relate to the U.S. pension plan. The assumed rate of return for 2011 for the U.S. plan was 8%, which was based on an asset allocation of approximately 40% in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities (which are expected to earn approximately 4% to 6% in the long term) and 60% in equity securities and high yield securities (which are expected to earn approximately 7% to 10% in the long term). Historical rates of return on the assets of the U.S. plan was 6.5% for the most recent 10 year period and 7.9% for the 20 year period. In the U.S. plan, our asset allocation policy has favored U.S. equity securities, which have returned 4.5% over the 10 year period and 8.3% over the 20 year period. The plan assets in the U.S. returned 7.0% in 2011 and 14.0% in 2010.Recently issued regulations under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, though not yet finalized, require that hybrid plans limit the maximum interest crediting rate to one among several choices of crediting rates which are considered market rates of return. The rate chosen will affect total pension obligations. The discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rates for our more significant plans, including our U.S. plan, were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan. The weighted average discount rate for U.S. and non U.S. plans determined on this basis was 4.69% at December 31, 2011, and 5.21% at December 31, 2010. For the determination of the expected rate of return on assets and the discount rate, we take into consideration external actuarial advice.Our funding requirements may be impacted by regulations or interpretations thereof. Our calculations of pension, postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent on the use of assumptions, including discount rates, hybrid plan maximum interest crediting rates and expected return on plan assets discussed above, rate of compensation increase of plan participants, interest cost, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, mortality rates, the number of associate retirements, the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 31, 2011, we had pretax actuarial losses, prior service credits, and transition obligations totaling $483.1 for the U.S. plans and $284.7 for the non U.S. plans that have not yet been charged to expense. These actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity. While we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension, postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense. For 2012, our assumption for the expected rate of return on assets is 7.13% for our U.S. plans and 6.85% for our non U.S. plans. Our assumptions are reviewed and determined on an annual basis.A 50 basis point change (in either direction) in the expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases, would have had approximately the following effect on 2011 pension expense: Increase/(Decrease) inPension Expense 50 Basis Point Increase DecreaseRate of return on assets (5.1) 5.1Discount rate (8.5) 8.3Rate of compensation increase 1.3 (1.2)TaxesWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future, in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made. We have recognized deferred tax assets of $282.1 relating to foreign tax credit carryforwards that will expire between 2018 and 222021. To the extent future U.S. taxable income is less favorable than currently projected by management, our ability to utilize these foreign tax credits may be affected and a valuation allowance may be required. Deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. when we conclude that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Deferred taxes are provided on earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested.We recognize the benefit of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements.We file income tax returns in many jurisdictions. In 2012, a number of open tax years are scheduled to close due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed. If our filing positions are ultimately upheld, it is possible that the 2012 provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments.Share based CompensationStock options issued to employees are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant. We use a Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options. This model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share based compensation may differ materially in the future from historical results.Loss ContingenciesWe determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable. Our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation, which, by its nature is unpredictable. We believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible AssetsWe test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, and more frequently if circumstances warrant, using fair value methods. We review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.We completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment assessments for 2011 during the year end close process and determined that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units, with the exception of our Silpada reporting unit. Our analysis of the Silpada business indicated an impairment as the carrying value of the business exceeded the estimated fair value. Accordingly, an estimated non cash before tax impairment charge of $263.0 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reduce the carrying amounts of goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset. At December 31, 2011, as a result of the impairment charge recorded, the carrying values of Silpadas goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset were $116.7 and $85.0, respectively. Following weaker than expected performance in the fourth quarter, we lowered our revenue and earnings projections for Silpada largely due to the rise in silver prices, which nearly doubled since the acquisition, and the negative impact of pricing on revenues and margins. The decline in the fair values of the Silpada reporting unit and the underlying trademark was driven by the reduction in the forecasted growth rates and cash flows used to estimate fair value. The impairment analyses performed for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets require several estimates in computing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite lived intangible asset. We use a discounted cash flow ("DCF") approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit, which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of a business, and is most consistent with the approach a market place participant would use. The estimation of fair value utilizing a DCF approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates, as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions, among other factors. Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of Silpada included the discount rate (based on the weighted average cost of capital), revenue growth, silver prices, and Representative growth and activity rates. The fair value of the Silpada trademark was determined using a risk adjusted DCF model under the relief from royalty method. The royalty rate used was based on a consideration of market rates. A decline in Silpada expected future cash flows and growth rates or a change in the 23risk adjusted discount rate used to fair value expected future cash flows may result in additional impairment charges for the goodwill and the indefinite lived trademark.See Note 17, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our 2011 Annual Report for further information on Silpada. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment assessments and no adjustments were necessary. Additionally, no events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicated that our definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the three years ended December 31, 2011. The impairment analyses performed for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets require several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of discount rates. A significant decline in expected future cash flows and growth rates or a change in the discount rate used to fair value expected future cash flows may result in a future impairment charge. 24Results Of Continuing Operations Consolidated %/Point Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009Total revenue $11,291.6 $10,862.8 $10,205.2 4 % 6 %Cost of sales 4,148.6 4,041.3 3,825.5 3 % 6 %Selling, general and administrative expenses 6,025.4 5,748.4 5,374.1 5 % 7 %Impairment of goodwill and intangible asset 263.0 * %Operating profit 854.6 1,073.1 1,005.6 (20)% 7 %Interest expense 92.9 87.1 104.8 7 % (17)%Interest income (16.5) (14.0) (20.2) 18 % (31)%Other expense, net 35.6 54.6 7.3 (35)% *Net income attributable to Avon $513.6 $606.3 $625.8 (15)% (3)%Diluted earnings per share attributable to Avon $1.18 $1.39 $1.45 (15)% (4)%Advertising expenses(1) $311.2 $400.4 $352.7 (22)% 14 % Gross margin 63.3 % 62.8 % 62.5 % .5 .3CTI restructuring .1 .1 .1 Venezuelan special items .6 (.6) .6Adjusted Non GAAP gross margin 63.4 % 63.5 % 62.6 % (.1) .9 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a % of total revenue 53.4 % 52.9 % 52.7 % .5 .2CTI restructuring (.3) (.7) (1.6) .4 .9Venezuelan special items (.1) .1 (.1)Adjusted Non GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a % of total revenue 53.1 % 52.2 % 51.0 % .9 1.2 Operating profit $854.6 $1,073.1 $1,005.6 (20)% 7 %CTI restructuring 40.0 80.7 171.0 Impairment charge 263.0 Venezuelan special items 79.5 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit $1,157.6 $1,233.3 $1,176.6 (6)% 5 % Operating margin 7.6 % 9.9 % 9.9 % (2.3) CTI restructuring .4 .7 1.7 (.3) (1.0)Impairment charge 2.3 2.3 Venezuelan special items .7 (.7) .7Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 10.3 % 11.4 % 11.5 % (1.1) (.1) Effective tax rate 29.1 % 37.0 % 32.2 % (7.9) 4.8CTI restructuring .1 .3 (2.2) (.2) 2.5Impairment charge 2.0 2.0 Venezuelan special items (5.6) 5.6 (5.6)Adjusted Non GAAP effective tax rate 31.3 % 31.8 % 30.0 % (.5) 1.8 Units sold (2)% 1 %Active Representatives (1)% 4 %Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. * Calculation not meaningful(1)Advertising expenses are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.25Total RevenueTotal revenue in 2011 increased 4%, with favorable foreign exchange contributing 3 points to the revenue increase. Constant $ revenues increased 1%. Active Representatives decreased 1%.On a category basis, the increase in revenue during 2011 was primarily driven by an increase of 5% in Beauty sales, with increases in all sub categories of Beauty. Within the Beauty category, fragrance increased 7%, color cosmetics increased 5%, personal care increased 4%, and skincare increased 3%. Fashion sales decreased 1% and Home sales increased 1%. On a Constant $ basis, the Beauty category increased 2%. Within the Beauty category, on a Constant $ basis, sales of fragrance increased 5%, color cosmetics increased 2%, personal care increased 1%, while skincare sales were flat. Constant $ sales of Fashion decreased 3%. We acquired Silpada at the end of July 2010. Inclusion of Silpadas results for July 2011 benefited the Fashion Constant $ growth rate by 5 points, as the similar periods results were not included in our 2010 financial results ("unmatched period"). Constant $ sales of Home decreased 2%.As noted previously in our Overview section, our revenue performance, primarily in the latter part of 2011 was negatively impacted by weaker macro economic conditions. In Brazil, our largest market, lower than normal service levels were further impacted by the implementation of an ERP system during the second half of the year, which weakened results. Additionally, slowing Beauty category market growth pressured Brazils results in the second half of 2011. During the latter part of 2011, we believe Russias performance was also impacted by weak trends in the Beauty category market in that country. During 2010, total revenues increased 6% from 2009, favorably impacted by growth in Active Representatives. Constant $ revenues also increased 6%. Acquisitions of Silpada in late July and Liz Earle in late March contributed approximately 1 point to revenue growth. Active Representatives increased 4% in 2010.On a category basis, the increase in revenue during 2010 was primarily driven by an increase of 6% in Beauty sales. Within the Beauty category, fragrance increased 11%, color cosmetics increased 7%, personal care increased 5% and skincare declined 3%. Fashion sales increased 11% and Home sales increased 3%. On a Constant $ basis, the Beauty category increased 6%. Within the Beauty category, Constant $ sales of fragrance increased 12%, color cosmetics increased 6%, personal care increased 5% and skincare declined 3%. Skincare growth rates benefited by 3 points from the Liz Earle acquisition. Constant $ sales of Fashion and Home increased 11% and 5%, respectively. Fashion growth rates benefited by 6 points from the Silpada acquisition.Strong revenue performance during the first half of 2010 was offset by a slowdown in revenue growth during the second half of the year. Our second half of 2010 revenue growth was negatively impacted by a slowdown in two of our largest markets, Brazil and Russia. Brazils moderated performance in the second half of 2010 was primarily caused by service disruptions resulting in shorting of products. The mid year implementation of government mandated e invoicing exacerbated our legacy order processing systems and capacity which had also been pressured by a significant increase in order scale in recent years. Russias performance in the second half of 2010 was primarily a result of slowing field growth due to weak incentives. Increases in social benefit taxes levied against certain Representatives exacerbated the slowdown in field growth. The increased taxes disproportionately reduced new and developing Representatives earnings, which reduced their motivation to recruit. In Russia, weaker color and skincare performance negatively impacted growth in the second half of 2010.For additional discussion of the changes in revenue by segment, see the Segment Review section of this MD&A.Gross MarginGross margin for 2011 increased by .5 points as compared to 2010, primarily due to the negative impact of the Venezuelan special items in 2010. On a Non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the CTI restructuring and the Venezuelan special items, gross margin decreased .1 points, as the negative impact of rising product costs was partially offset by pricing benefits and favorable foreign currency.Gross margin for 2010 increased by .3 points as compared to 2009. On a Non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the CTI restructuring and the Venezuelan special items, gross margin improved .9 points, reflecting benefits from manufacturing productivity gains, which include benefits from the Strategic Sourcing Initiative ("SSI"), and the favorable impact of foreign exchange transactions. SSI was an initiative that shifted our purchasing strategy towards a globally coordinated one, which leveraged volumes.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2011 increased $277.0 as compared to 2010. This increase is primarily due to our continued investing in RVP, as well as higher distribution costs and bad debt expense. We invested approximately $121.0 incrementally in our RVP during 2011, by continued implementation of our Sales Leadership program and higher incentives. Selling, general and administrative expenses during 2011, benefited from lower expenses associated with employee incentive compensation plans.26On an Adjusted Non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of CTI restructuring and the Venezuelan special items, as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses during 2011, increased by 90 basis points, as higher RVP, distribution costs and bad debt expense were partially offset by lower advertising. Dual distribution costs attributable to the transition to the new facilities in Brazil and Colombia negatively impacted selling, general and administrative expenses during 2011 as compared to 2010.Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2010 increased $374.3 as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher advertising and RVP costs; significant professional and related fees associated with the FCPA investigation and compliance reviews described in Note 16, Contingencies, to our 2011 Annual Report of approximately $95 (up approximately $59 from 2009); and higher volume related costs, such as distribution costs, partially offset by lower CTI from our restructuring initiatives. On an Adjusted Non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of CTI restructuring and the Venezuelan special items, as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses during 2010, increased by 1.2 points as compared to 2009, due to higher advertising and RVP costs and the significant professional and related fees associated with the FCPA matters.Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible AssetDuring 2011 we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $263.0 for goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset associated with Silpada. Refer to Note 17, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our 2011 Annual Report for more details.See the Segment Review section of MD&A for additional information related to changes in operating margin by segment.Other ExpensesInterest expense during 2011 increased by 7% as compared to 2010, primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances. Interest expense decreased by 17% in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to lower interest rates. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 74% of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR.Interest income increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates. Interest income decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to lower interest rates.Other expense, net for 2011, as compared to 2010 decreased primarily due to a $46.1 negative impact in 2010 from the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting which occurred in 2010, partially offset by higher foreign exchange losses in 2011. Other expense, net for 2010 was higher than during 2009 as a result of the $46.1 Venezuelan currency devaluation. Refer to the Latin America segment review for a further discussion of the Venezuelan currency.Effective Tax RateThe effective tax rate for 2011 was 29.1%, compared to 37.0% for 2010 and 32.2% for 2009.The effective tax rate for 2011 included tax benefits from audit settlements and statute expirations, which favorably impacted the tax rate by 3.1 points. In addition, the 2011 tax rate was favorably impacted by 2.0 points from the tax benefit on the impairment charge associated with our Silpada business.The effective tax rate for 2010 was unfavorably impacted by 5.6 points due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting discussed further within the Latin America Segment review, partially offset by 2.1 points associated with benefits from audit settlements and statute expirations. The effective tax rate for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by 3.4 points from the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets primarily as a result of restructuring activities, partially offset by 2.1 points from a reduction in a foreign tax liability. In addition, the 2009 tax rate benefited by 2.0 points from the establishment of deferred taxes on certain inflationary adjustments that, beginning in 2010, are no longer recorded under highly inflationary accounting. The 2009 tax rate also included higher tax costs associated with the repatriation of earnings, offset by favorable changes in the earnings mix of international subsidiaries.With respect to 2012, we have decided to not indefinitely reinvest any current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, the 2012 effective tax rate will be negatively impacted.27Segment ReviewBeginning in the first quarter of 2011, the results of Asia Pacific and China were managed as a single operating segment. Accordingly, Asia Pacific amounts include the results of China for all periods presented. Below is an analysis of the key factors affecting revenue and operating profit by reportable segment for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2011.Years ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 TotalRevenue OperatingProfit TotalRevenue OperatingProfit TotalRevenue OperatingProfitLatin America $5,116.0 $630.4 $4,589.5 $604.7 $4,103.2 $647.9North America 2,110.4 (184.4) 2,244.0 155.9 2,293.4 110.4Central & Eastern Europe 1,580.6 295.2 1,585.8 297.8 1,500.1 244.9Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 1,542.2 183.7 1,462.1 176.5 1,277.8 84.2Asia Pacific 942.4 81.4 981.4 82.6 1,030.7 81.7Total from operations 11,291.6 1,006.3 10,862.8 1,317.5 10,205.2 1,169.1Global and other expenses (151.7) (244.4) (163.5)Total $11,291.6 $854.6 $10,862.8 $1,073.1 $10,205.2 $1,005.6Global and other expenses include, among other things, costs related to our executive and administrative offices, information technology, research and development, and marketing. Certain planned global expenses are allocated to our business segments primarily based on planned revenue. The unallocated costs remain as global and other expenses. We do not allocate costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to our global functions to our segments. Costs of implementing restructuring initiatives related to a specific segment are recorded within that segment. 2011 2010 % Change 2010 2009 % ChangeTotal global expenses $651.1 $713.6 (9)% $713.6 $577.3 24%Allocated to segments (499.4) (469.2) 6 % (469.2) (413.8) 13%Net global expenses $151.7 $244.4 (38)% $244.4 $163.5 49%Total Global expenses declined during 2011 from 2010 primarily due to lower expenses associated with management incentive programs, lower professional fees associated with acquisitions and divestitures, and lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives. Amounts allocated to segments increased in 2011 primarily due to an increase in costs associated with initiatives more specifically benefiting the segments as compared to global initiatives. Professional and related fees associated with the FCPA investigation and compliance reviews described in Note 16, Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein, amounted to approximately $93.3 in 2011. While these fees are difficult to predict, they are expected to continue and may vary during the course of this investigation. These fees were not allocated to the segments. Please see Risk Factors and Note 16, Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein, for more information regarding the FCPA investigation and other related matters.The increase in Net Global expenses for 2010 as compared to 2009, was primarily attributable to significant professional and related fees associated with the FCPA investigation and compliance reviews of approximately $95.3 (up approximately $59.0 from 2009). The increase in Net Global expenses for 2010 as compared to 2009 was also due to higher costs associated with global initiatives and costs associated with business acquisitions. 28Latin America 2011 Compared to 2010 %/Point Change 2011 2010 US$ Constant $Total revenue $5,116.0 $4,589.5 11 % 8 %Operating profit 630.4 604.7 4 % (12)%CTI restructuring 3.1 19.8 Venezuelan special items 79.5 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 633.5 704.0 (10)% (14)% Operating margin 12.3% 13.2% (0.9) (2.8)CTI restructuring .1 .4 Venezuelan special items 1.7 Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 12.4% 15.3% (2.9) (3.1) Units sold 2 %Active Representatives 3 %Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. Total revenue during 2011 increased due to higher average order and growth in Active Representatives, as well as due to favorable foreign exchange. Average order benefited from the favorable impacts of pricing while Active Representatives growth benefited from continued investments in RVP. Revenue during 2011 grew 6% in Brazil and 17% in Mexico, with benefits from favorable foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue during 2011 benefited from continued growth in most markets, particularly from growth of 14% in Mexico. Constant $ revenue in Brazil was relatively flat. In Venezuela, revenue and Constant $ revenue during 2011 grew 28%. Additional information regarding our Venezuela operations is discussed in more detail below. Brazils performance during 2011 continued to be pressured by lower than normal service levels. In addition, lower than normal service levels were further impacted by the implementation of an ERP system during the second half of the year, which in turn has negatively impacted average order, Active Representatives, and revenue growth. Additionally, slowing Beauty category market growth pressured Brazils results in the second half of 2011. While the implementation of the ERP system and transformation of the related processes may negatively impact service levels in the short term, we expect the ERP system to help improve our service reliability over the long term. Constant $ revenue growth in Mexico during 2011, was driven by an increase in Active Representatives and a higher average order. Revenue growth during 2011 in Venezuela was the result of a higher average order primarily due to increased prices, primarily as a result of inflation.The decrease in Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin during 2011 was driven by a sharp decline in Brazils operating margin. Brazils 2011 operating margin was partially unfavorably impacted by inventory related charges primarily due to supply chain challenges, which negatively impacted Latin Americas operating margin by .3 points. Additionally, Brazils decline in operating margin was further caused by business disruptions and resulting investments in that market, as well as inflationary pressure on costs. Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin in the region during 2011 was also negatively impacted by higher bad debt expense and higher distribution costs due to the transition to the new facilities in Brazil and Colombia. Operating margin during 2010, in Latin America was negatively impacted by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with higher inflationary accounting as discussed further below.Effective January 1, 2010, we began to account for Venezuela as a highly inflationary economy. Effective January 11, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure. The official exchange rate moved from 2.15 to 2.60 for essential goods and to 4.30 for nonessential goods and services. Effective December 30, 2010, the Venezuelan government eliminated the 2.60 rate which had been available for the import of essential goods. Substantially all of the imports of our subsidiary in Venezuela (Avon Venezuela) fall into the nonessential classification.As a result of the change in the official rate to 4.30 in conjunction with accounting for our operations in Venezuela under highly inflationary accounting guidelines, during the first quarter of 2010, we recorded net charges of $46.1 in Other expense, net and $12.7 in income taxes, for a total after tax charge of $58.8, reflecting the write down of monetary assets and liabilities and deferred tax benefits. Additionally, certain nonmonetary assets must continue to be carried at U.S. historic dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation. Therefore, the historic U.S. dollar costs impacted the income statement during 2010 at a 29disproportionate rate as they had not been devalued based on the new exchange rates. As a result of using the U.S. historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets, such as inventory, acquired prior to the devaluation, operating profit during 2010 was negatively impacted by $79.5, for the difference between the historical cost at the previous official exchange rate of 2.15 and the current official exchange rate of 4.30. As there were no further devaluations, there was an immaterial impact on operating profit in 2011 from the 2010 Venezuelan currency devaluations.Currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government in 2003 have impacted the ability of Avon Venezuela to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products. Since 2003, Avon Venezuela had been obtaining its foreign currency needs beyond the amounts that could be obtained at official rates through non government sources where the exchange rates were less favorable than the official rate (parallel market). In late May 2010, the Venezuelan government took control over the previously freely traded parallel market. Trading in the parallel market was suspended for several weeks in May and June and reopened as a regulated (SITME) market in early June 2010. The government has imposed volume restrictions on trading activity, limiting an entitys activity to a maximum of $0.35 per month. The current limit is below the monthly foreign exchange requirements of our Venezuelan operations and, unless these restrictions are modified, may have a negative impact on Avon Venezuelas future operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to recover the higher cost of obtaining foreign currency in the SITME market as compared to the official rate through operating activities, such as increased pricing or cost reductions in other areas.At December 31, 2011, we had a net asset position of $183.4 associated with our operations in Venezuela, which included cash balances of approximately $195.8 of which approximately $193.4 was denominated in Bolvares remeasured at the December 31, 2011 official exchange rate and approximately $2.4 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Of the $183.4 net asset position, approximately $209.8 was associated with bolvar denominated monetary net assets and deferred income taxes. Additionally, during 2011 Avon Venezuelas revenue and operating profit represented approximately 4% of Avons consolidated revenue, 7% of Avons consolidated operating profit, and 5% of Avons Non GAAP operating profit.During 2011, the exchange rate in the SITME market ranged within 5 to 6 Bolvares to the U.S. Dollar; however, as noted previously, access to U.S. Dollars in the SITME market is limited. To illustrate our sensitivity to potential future changes in the official exchange rate in Venezuela, if the official exchange rate was further devalued as of December 31, 2011, to a rate of 9.0 Bolvares to the U.S. dollar, or an approximate 52% devaluation, our results would be negatively impacted as follows:As a result of the use of a further devalued exchange rate for the remeasurement of Avon Venezuelas revenues and profits, Avons annualized consolidated revenues would likely be negatively impacted by approximately 2% and annualized consolidated operating profit would likely be negatively impacted by approximately 3% prospectively, assuming 2011s consolidated operating profit (without the Silpada impairment charge) and no operational improvements occurred to offset the negative impact of a further devaluation. Avons consolidated operating profit during the first twelve months following the devaluation, in this example, would likely be negatively impacted by approximately 8%, assuming no offsetting operational improvements. The larger negative impact on operating profit during the first twelve months as compared to the prospective impact is caused by costs of nonmonetary assets being carried at historic dollar cost in accordance with the requirement to account for Venezuela as a highly inflationary economy while revenue would be remeasured at the further devalued rate. We would likely incur an immediate charge of approximately $86.1 ($80.2 in Other expenses, net and $5.9 in Income taxes) associated with the $209.8 of Bolvar denominated monetary net assets and deferred income taxes.During 2011, costs associated with acquiring goods that required settlement in U.S. dollars through the SITME markets in Venezuela included within operating profit were approximately $17.0. The amounts reported for costs associated with acquiring goods that required settlement in U.S. dollars through the parallel or SITME markets in Venezuela included within operating profit during 2010 were approximately $56. Additionally, if the exchange rate in the SITME market is further devalued, or an alternative source of exchange becomes available at an unfavorable rate beyond the SITME rate of 5.7 Bolvares to the U.S. Dollar, our results would be negatively impacted. At December 31, 2011, Avon Venezuela had pending requests submitted with an agency of the Venezuelan government for approximately $131 for remittance of dividends and royalties to its parent company in the U.S. These outstanding requests had been periodically submitted between 2005 and 2011.30Latin America 2010 Compared to 2009 %/Point Change 2010 2009 US$ Constant $Total revenue $4,589.5 $4,103.2 12 % 13 %Operating profit 604.7 647.9 (7)% 6 %CTI restructuring 19.8 34.4 Venezuelan special items 79.5 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 704.0 682.3 3 % 4 % Operating margin 13.2% 15.8% (2.6) (1.0)CTI restructuring .4 .8 Venezuelan special items 1.7 Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 15.3% 16.6% (1.3) (1.4) Units sold 5 %Active Representatives 8 %Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. Total revenue during 2010 increased as compared to 2009 due to growth in Active Representatives, driven by continued investments in RVP, and a higher average order. Revenue during 2010 grew 20% in Brazil and 15% in Mexico, with benefits from favorable foreign exchange, while the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange drove a revenue decline of 27% in Venezuela during 2010. Constant $ revenue during 2010 benefited from continued growth in most markets, particularly from growth of 8% in Brazil, 8% in Mexico and 47% in Venezuela.Constant $ revenue growth in Mexico during 2010, was driven by an increase in Active Representatives, as well as an increase in average order. Constant $ revenue growth for 2010, in Venezuela reflected a higher average order primarily due to increased prices, partially as a result of inflation, and growth in Active Representatives.Constant $ revenue growth during 2010 in Brazil was primarily driven by an increase in Active Representatives. Constant $ revenue growth in 2010 in Brazil was pressured by service disruptions in the second half of the year and a decline in skin care sales. Brazils revenue grew 38% and 9% during the first half and second half of 2010, respectively, with constant $ growth rates of 13% in the first half and 4% in the second half. Brazils performance in the second half of 2010 was primarily driven by service disruptions resulting in shorting of products. The mid year implementation of government mandated e invoicing exacerbated our legacy order processing systems and capacity which have also been pressured by a significant increase in order scale in recent years as Brazils growth during this period outpaced our expectations and our planned infrastructure investments. These factors pressured the capacity of our legacy systems and were the primary cause of the service disruptions.Operating margin declined during 2010 in Latin America due to the negative impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting as discussed previously. The decline in operating margin during 2010 caused by the Venezuelan special items was partially offset by benefits of .4 points from lower CTI restructuring. On an Adjusted Non GAAP basis, excluding the Venezuelan special items and CTI restructuring, the decrease in operating margin in 2010 was primarily driven by higher distribution costs, increased investment in RVP and advertising, partially offset by the benefit of favorable foreign exchange.31North America 2011 Compared to 2010 %/Point Change 2011 2010 US$ Constant $Total revenue $2,110.4 $2,244.0 (6)% (6)%Operating (loss) profit (184.4) 155.9 (218)% (219)%CTI restructuring 24.7 41.3 Impairment charge 263.0 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 103.3 197.2 (48)% (49)% Operating margin (8.7)% 6.9% (15.6) (15.8)CTI restructuring 1.2 1.8 Impairment charge 12.5 Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 4.9 % 8.8% (3.9) (4.0) Units sold (10)%Active Representatives (8)%Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. North America consists largely of the U.S. business and includes the results of Silpada for the period since its acquisition at the end of July 2010. During 2011, Silpadas results have been included in the North America results for the entire year presented, whereas the results during 2010 include Silpadas results only since the end of July 2010. The inclusion of Silpada in our 2011 results for the unmatched period through July favorably impacted North America revenue growth by 4 points, operating profit growth by 6 points, Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit growth by 1 point, and Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit margin growth by .1 point. The total revenue decline for 2011 was primarily due to a decline in Active Representatives. Sales of Beauty products decreased 6% during 2011, partly due to weakness in the beauty market. Sales of non Beauty products declined 7% during 2011. The inclusion of Silpada in our 2011 results during the unmatched period through July contributed 10 points to non Beauty growth rates during 2011. In 2011, operating margin in North America was negatively impacted by an impairment charge of Silpada goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset. See Note 17, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our 2011 Annual Report for a discussion regarding Silpada. On an Adjusted Non GAAP basis, excluding the impairment charge and CTI restructuring, the decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by lower revenues while continuing to incur overhead expenses that do not vary directly with revenue, increased investment in RVP, and lower gross margin due to commodity cost pressures. Partially offsetting these negative impacts were lower advertising and improved bad debt. During 2011, operating margin benefited by .5 points due to a reduction in the estimated fair value of an earnout provision recorded in connection with the Silpada acquisition, as we revised our estimate of the earnout liability to be zero. In comparison, operating margin during 2010 benefited by .7 points due to the change in the fair value of the earnout provision from $26 at the date of acquisition to $11 at December 31, 2010.Given that our results have been pressured, we have focused on our recovery plan, which has included enhancing our sales leadership model and optimizing our product portfolio. During the latter portion of the year, there has been positive reaction to our recalibration of the mix of Beauty and non Beauty products and focus on Smart Value within Beauty, as part of the optimization of our product portfolio. We are continuing to focus on field transformation as we move to a stronger multi level leadership structure, as well as simplifying and enhancing the earnings opportunity for Representatives. As we focus on field transformation and redistricting, we expect variability in our financial results through 2012.32North America 2010 Compared to 2009 %/Point Change 2010 2009 US$ Constant $Total revenue $2,244.0 $2,293.4 (2)% (3)%Operating profit 155.9 110.4 41 % 37 %CTI restructuring 41.3 40.5 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 197.2 150.9 31 % 28 % Operating margin 6.9% 4.8% 2.1 2.0CTI restructuring 1.8 1.8 Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 8.8% 6.6% 2.2 2.1 Units sold (7)%Active Representatives (3)%Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. The inclusion of Silpadas results during the latter portion of 2010 favorably impacted North America revenue growth by 5 points during 2010 as compared to 2009. Silpada also favorably impacted operating profit growth by 31 points during 2010 and favorably impacted Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit growth by 23 points. As a result of the Silpada acquisition, units sold and Active Representatives for 2010 were each favorably impacted by 1 point.The total revenue decline during 2010 was due to a decline in Active Representatives and a lower average order received from Representatives. The decline in Active Representatives for 2010 was largely due to a decline in additions compared with 2009s record recruiting. This resulted in strong growth in Active Representatives during 2009 causing an unfavorable comparison in 2010. Sales of non Beauty products decreased 1% during 2010, with Silpada offsetting the decline by 10 points. Sales of Beauty products decreased 4% during 2010, partly due to weakness in the beauty market.The increase in North America operating margin and Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin during 2010 was primarily driven by improvements in gross margin caused by favorable pricing and mix and manufacturing productivity gains and the inclusion of Silpada results, which benefited operating margin by 1.2 points during 2010, despite approximately $7 of amortization of intangible assets. These operating margin benefits were negatively impacted by lower revenues which were not able to offset overhead expenses, despite cost saving initiatives. The costs associated with completing the Silpada acquisition were recorded in global expenses and were not allocated to the North America segment. Included within the Silpada results was an operating margin benefit of .7 points due to a change in the estimated fair value of an earnout provision recorded in connection with the Silpada acquisition.Central & Eastern Europe 2011 Compared to 2010 %/Point Change 2011 2010 US$ Constant $Total revenue $1,580.6 $1,585.8 % (4)%Operating profit 295.2 297.8 (1)% (5)%CTI restructuring 2.5 4.7 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 297.7 302.5 (2)% (6)% Operating margin 18.7% 18.8% (.1) (.3)CTI restructuring .2 .3 Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 18.8% 19.1% (.3) (.4) Units sold (6)%Active Representatives (2)%Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. Total revenue during 2011 was flat primarily due to declines in Active Representatives as well as average order, due to macro economic pressures in the region. These declines were offset by favorable foreign exchange. During 2011 revenue in Russia declined 1%. On a Constant $ basis, revenue declined 4% in Russia for 2011 due to declines in average order as well as Active 33Representatives. During the latter part of 2011, we believe Russias performance was also impacted by weak trends in the Beauty category market in that country. On an Adjusted Non GAAP basis, operating margin decreased in 2011 as improved gross margin was offset by higher distribution costs and the unfavorable impact of lower revenues while continuing to incur overhead expenses that do not vary directly with revenue. Increased investments in RVP was offset by lower advertising. RVP investment increased in 2011 in part to address the increased social benefit taxes levied against certain Representatives beginning in 2010.Central & Eastern Europe 2010 Compared to 2009 %/Point Change 2010 2009 US$ Constant $Total revenue $1,585.8 $1,500.1 6% 5%Operating profit 297.8 244.9 22% 22%CTI restructuring 4.7 29.7 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 302.5 274.6 10% 12% Operating margin 18.8% 16.3% 2.5 2.7CTI restructuring .3 2.0 Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 19.1% 18.3% .8 1.1 Units sold 3%Active Representatives 4%Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. Total revenue during 2010 increased compared to 2009 due to growth in Active Representatives and a higher average order, as well as favorable foreign exchange. The regions revenue benefited from growth of 11% in Russia, due partially to favorable foreign exchange. During 2010, Constant $ revenue in Russia increased by 7% due to a growth in Active Representatives and a higher average order. Russias revenue grew 26% in the first half of 2010, but was flat during the second half, with Constant $ growth rates of 14% in the first half and 2% in the second half. Russias performance in the second half of 2010 was primarily a result of slowing field growth due to weak incentives. Increases in social benefit taxes levied against certain Representatives exacerbated the slowdown in field growth. The increased taxes disproportionately reduced new and developing Representatives earnings, which reduced their motivation to recruit. In Russia, weaker color and skincare performance negatively impacted revenue growth in the second half of 2010. During the first quarter of 2011, we launched a new sales leadership compensation plan to help offset the tax burden on these Representatives.During 2010, operating margin benefited by 1.7 points due to lower CTI restructuring compared to the prior year. On an Adjusted Non GAAP basis, the increase in operating margin during 2010 was primarily driven by the benefit of leverage from higher revenues with fixed overhead expenses, partially offset by a lower gross margin.Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 2011 Compared to 2010 %/Point Change 2011 2010 US$ Constant $Total revenue $1,542.2 $1,462.1 5 % 5 %Operating profit 183.7 176.5 4 % 2 %CTI restructuring 2.8 1.6 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 186.5 178.1 5 % 3 % Operating margin 11.9% 12.1% (.2) (.3)CTI restructuring .2 .1 Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 12.1% 12.2% (.1) (.2) Units sold 1 %Active Representatives 4 %Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently.34Total revenue during 2011 increased primarily as a result of an increase in Active Representatives. The regions revenue growth for 2011 was primarily due to significant growth in South Africa, partially offset by a revenue decline in the United Kingdom. Additionally, total revenue in 2011 was favorably impacted by approximately 1 point due to a benefit to the United Kingdoms revenue resulting from the settlement of a long time dispute associated with an estimated Value Added Tax ("VAT") liability which was initially recognized as a reduction to revenue. The region experienced Constant $ growth through the first nine months of 2011 but saw declines in the fourth quarter, partly due to the negative impact of the continued difficult economic environment on Fashion and Home sales. The inclusion of Liz Earle in our 2011 results for the unmatched period through March favorably impacted the regions revenue growth by 1 point.During 2011, revenue in South Africa increased 31%, partially benefiting from favorable foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, revenue in South Africa increased 29%, due to growth in Active Representatives. During 2011, revenue in Turkey declined 5%, due to unfavorable foreign exchange, while on a Constant $ basis Turkey grew 5%, due to growth in Active Representatives and higher average order. In the United Kingdom, revenue declined by 1% in 2011 including benefits from favorable foreign exchange as well as the VAT settlement. On a Constant $ basis, revenue in the United Kingdom in 2011 declined by 4%, primarily due to a decline in Active Representatives and lower average order, partially offset by the VAT settlement, which benefited Constant $ growth rates by 4 points.The decreases in operating margin and Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin in 2011, were primarily driven by a decline in gross margin due to higher commodity costs and the negative impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by the favorable impact of the revenue associated with the VAT settlement and reduced overhead spending.Western Europe, Middle East & Africa 2010 Compared to 2009 %/Point Change 2010 2009 US$ Constant $Total revenue $1,462.1 $1,277.8 14% 15%Operating profit 176.5 84.2 110% 107%CTI restructuring 1.6 31.0 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 178.1 115.2 55% 56% Operating margin 12.1% 6.6% 5.5 5.5CTI restructuring .1 2.4 Adjusted Non CAAP operating margin 12.2% 9.0% 3.2 3.2 Units sold 12%Active Representatives 12%Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. Total revenue during 2010 primarily increased as compared to 2009 as a result of an increase in Active Representatives. The regions revenue growth during 2010 was primarily due to significant growth in South Africa and Turkey, as well as the acquisition of Liz Earle, which contributed approximately 3 points to revenue growth in 2010. During 2010, revenue increased 17% in Turkey and Constant $ revenue increased 15% in Turkey, due primarily to strong growth in Active Representatives, driven by continued investments in RVP. During 2010, revenue increased 82% in South Africa, partially benefiting from favorable foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue growth of 64% during 2010 in South Africa was primarily attributable to strong growth in Active Representatives, driven by investments in RVP, and the expansion of our geographic reach in the country. During 2010, revenue increased by 1% in the United Kingdom, while Constant $ revenue increased by 3% due to a growth in Active Representatives, partially offset by a lower average order.During 2010, operating margin benefited by 2.3 points due to lower CTI restructuring compared to the prior year. On an Adjusted Non GAAP basis, excluding CTI restructuring, the increase in operating margin during 2010 was primarily driven by improvements in gross margin, driven by improved manufacturing productivity, including the benefits of SSI.35Asia Pacific 2011 Compared to 2010 %/Point Change 2011 2010 US$ Constant $Total revenue $942.4 $981.4 (4)% (9)%Operating profit 81.4 82.6 (1)% (13)%CTI restructuring (0.3) (0.3) Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 81.1 82.3 (1)% (13)% Operating margin 8.6 % 8.4 % .2 (.3)CTI restructuring Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 8.6 % 8.4 % .2 (.3) Units sold (9)%Active Representatives (11)%Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, the results of Asia Pacific and China were managed as a single operating segment. Accordingly, Asia Pacific amounts include the results of China for all periods presented. In addition, the regions results for all periods exclude Japan, which was sold in 2010 and classified as a discontinued operation.Total revenue during 2011 declined primarily due to a decrease in Active Representatives, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Revenue grew 3% in the Philippines during 2011, benefiting from favorable foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue in the Philippines declined 1% in 2011 reflecting increased competitive activity. The regions results were negatively impacted by a continued decline in skincare sales during 2011.Revenue declined 20% in China during 2011, or 24% in Constant $. In 2011, we continued the rollout of service centers to support direct selling. As we continue to transition towards direct selling, we are focused on improving the productivity of Representatives.Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin increased during 2011, primarily due to lower advertising costs, as well as favorable foreign exchange. The favorable impact of these items was partially offset by lower gross margin and higher RVP spending. With regards to gross margin, while favorable pricing offset higher commodity costs, gross margin declined due to adverse product mix.Asia Pacific 2010 Compared to 2009 %/Point Change 2010 2009 US$ Constant $Total revenue $981.4 $1,030.7 (5)%(10)%Operating profit 82.6 81.7 1 % (11)%CTI restructuring (0.3) 20.4 Adjusted Non GAAP operating profit 82.3 102.1 (19)% (28)% Operating margin 8.4% 7.9% .5 (.1)CTI restructuring 2.0 Adjusted Non GAAP operating margin 8.4% 9.9% (1.5) (2.0) Units sold (13)%Active Representatives (7)%Amounts in the table above may not necessarily sum because the computations are made independently. Total revenue during 2010 decreased primarily due to a decrease in Active Representatives and lower average order, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Revenue grew 15% during 2010 in the Philippines, benefiting partially from favorable foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue during 2010 in the Philippines increased by 10% driven by growth in Active Representatives, which was supported by RVP initiatives, offset by a lower average order. The regions results were negatively impacted by a decline in skincare sales during 2010. 36Revenue declined 35%, or 36% in Constant $, in China due to significant revenue declines in both direct selling and Beauty Boutiques. The fundamental challenges in our complex hybrid business model, including conflicting needs of retail and direct selling, impacted both businesses. Our continued transition away from our complex hybrid business model in China to one which focuses on direct selling and updating our service center model includes a realigned field compensation structure and recalibrated merchandising and campaign management strategies to support direct selling.During 2010, operating margin benefited by 2.0 points due to lower CTI restructuring compared to the prior year. This benefit was partially offset by an unfavorable change in operating margin in China that was primarily driven by significantly lower revenues. On an Adjusted Non GAAP basis, excluding CTI restructuring, operating margin during 2010 declined due to the lower revenues in China. Partially offsetting this decline was improved gross margin in other markets in the region, which benefited from lower product costs and favorable foreign exchange, which benefited gross margin by approximately 1 point, partially offset by an increased investment in RVP.Liquidity And Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, commercial paper, borrowings under lines of credit, public offerings of notes, and a private placement. As disclosed in the Latin America Segment Review, at December 31, 2011, we held cash balances associated with our Venezuela operations denominated in Bolvares amounting to approximately $193 when translated at the official exchange rate. Currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government have impacted our ability to repatriate dividends and royalties from our Venezuelan operations on a timely basis. We currently believe that existing cash outside of Venezuela, as well as cash to be generated from operations outside of Venezuela along with available sources of public and private financing are adequate to meet the Companys anticipated requirements for general corporate needs. Substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside of the U.S., as it relates to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, a portion of which we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were distributed to the U.S. parent as dividends, we may be subject to additional taxes. With respect to 2012, we have decided to not indefinitely reinvest any current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We may, from time to time, seek to repurchase our equity or to retire our outstanding debt in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, derivative instruments or otherwise. During 2011, we repurchased approximately .4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.7. During 2010, we repurchased approximately .4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $14.1. Retirements of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. We may also elect to incur additional debt or issue equity or convertible securities to finance ongoing operations, acquisitions or to meet our other liquidity needs.In July 2010, Avon completed the purchase of substantially all the assets and liabilities of Silpada for approximately $650 in cash. The acquisition was funded with cash and commercial paper borrowings. Refer to Note 17, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our 2011 Annual Report for more details.Any issuances of equity securities or convertible securities could have a dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our current shareholders and may adversely impact earnings per share in future periods.Our liquidity could also be impacted by dividends, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and certain contingencies described more fully in Note 16, Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein. At any given time, we may be in discussions and negotiations with potential acquisition candidates. Acquisitions may be accretive or dilutive and by their nature involve numerous risks and uncertainties. See our Cautionary Statement for purposes of the Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Balance Sheet Data 2011 2010Cash and cash equivalents $1,245.1 $1,179.9Total debt 3,308.4 3,136.2Working capital 1,207.8 1,228.037Cash Flows 2011 2010 2009Net cash from continuing operating activities $655.8 $689.0 $754.7Net cash from continuing investing activities (267.7) (1,095.7) (218.3)Net cash from continuing financing activities (284.5) 234.7 (361.2)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents (37.2) (33.7) 5.6Net Cash from Continuing Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided from continuing operating activities during 2011 was $33.2 lower than 2010. Operating cash flow during 2011 was negatively impacted by a $75.0 contribution to the U.S. pension plan, a payment associated with a long term incentive compensation plan of approximately $36, and higher payments associated with CTI restructuring. Partially offsetting these unfavorable comparisons were higher cash related net income and the higher recovery of value added taxes in Brazil.Net cash provided from continuing operating activities during 2010 was $65.7 lower than 2009, primarily due to both higher inventories resulting from lower than expected sales and the negative impacts of timing of restructuring payments. Offsetting these unfavorable comparisons are the recovery of value added taxes in Brazil.Inventory levels increased during 2011, to $1,161.3 at December 31, 2011, from $1,152.9 at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting the benefit of favorable foreign exchange offset by the adverse impact of the ERP implementation in Brazil and lower than expected sales. New inventory life cycle management processes leveraged with initiatives such as ERP implementation and the Sales and Operations Planning process are expected to improve inventory levels in the long term. Inventory days are down 2 days in 2011 as compared to 2010, due to the benefit of favorable foreign exchange offset by the adverse impact of the ERP implementation in Brazil and lower than expected sales. We maintain defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans (see Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans to our 2011 Annual Report). Our funding policy for these plans is based on legal requirements and cash flows. The amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Estimates). The future funding for these plans will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of associates electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. Based on current assumptions, we expect to make contributions in the range of $40 to $45 to our U.S. pension plans and in the range of $40 to $45 to our international pension plans during 2012.Net Cash from Continuing Investing ActivitiesNet cash used by continuing investing activities during 2011 was $828.0 lower than during 2010, primarily due to the acquisitions of Silpada and Liz Earle in 2010, as well as lower capital expenditures. Net cash used by continuing investing activities during 2010 was $877.4 higher than during 2009, primarily due to the acquisitions of Silpada and Liz Earle. In addition during the first half of 2009, we redeemed certain corporate owned life insurance policies. Capital expenditures during 2011 were $276.7 compared with $331.2 in 2010, as 2010 included higher investment associated with new distribution facilities in Latin America. Capital expenditures during 2010 were $331.2 compared with $296.3 in 2009 due to higher information technology expenditures in Latin America. Capital expenditures in 2012 are currently expected to be approximately $260 to $290 and will be funded by cash from operations. Net Cash from Continuing Financing ActivitiesNet cash used by continuing financing activities of $284.5 during 2011 compared unfavorably to cash provided by continuing financing activities of $234.7 during 2010 primarily due to the issuance of debt in 2010 to partially finance the Silpada acquisition.Net cash provided by continuing financing activities of $234.7 during 2010 compared favorably to cash used by continuing financing activities of $361.2 during 2009 primarily due to the issuance of debt in 2010 to partially finance the Silpada acquisition.We purchased approximately .4 million shares of our common stock for $7.7 during 2011, as compared to .4 million shares of our common stock for $14.1 during 2010 and .4 million shares for $8.6 during 2009, under our previously announced share repurchase programs and through acquisition of stock from employees in connection with tax payments upon vesting of restricted stock units. In October 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $2 billion of our common stock over a five year period, which began in December 2007.38We increased our quarterly dividend payments to $.23 per share in 2011 from $.22 per share in 2010. Debt and Contractual Financial Obligations and CommitmentsAt December 31, 2011, our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017and Beyond TotalShort term debt $832.6 $ $ $ $ $ $832.6Long term debt 375.0 500.0 142.0 1,243.0 2,260.0Capital lease obligations 16.7 9.8 9.1 6.5 5.9 29.3 77.3Total debt 849.3 384.8 509.1 148.5 5.9 1,272.3 3,169.9Debt related interest 115.9 101.8 74.0 68.8 65.2 66.3 492.0Total debt related 965.2 486.6 583.1 217.3 71.1 1,338.6 3,661.9Operating leases 105.0 92.2 79.6 68.9 52.5 146.1 544.3Purchase obligations 344.6 154.4 126.1 115.3 120.4 5.7 866.5Benefit obligations(1) 86.0 10.8 10.4 8.8 9.3 80.7 206.0Total debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments(2) $1,500.8 $744.0 $799.2 $410.3 $253.3 $1,571.1 $5,278.7 (1)Amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as expected contributions for 2012 to our funded pension benefit plans. We are not able to estimate our contributions to our funded pension plans beyond 2012.(2)The amount of debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments excludes amounts due under derivative transactions. The table also excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding, are generally consistent from year to year, and are short term in nature. The table does not include any reserves for income taxes because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. At December 31, 2011, our reserves for income taxes, including interest and penalties, totaled $41.8.See Note 5, Debt and Other Financing, and Note 14, Leases and Commitments, to our 2011 Annual Report for further information on our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 15, Restructuring Initiatives, we have a remaining liability of $73.9 at December 31, 2011, associated with the restructuring charges recorded to date under the 2005 and 2009 Restructuring Programs, and we also expect to record additional restructuring charges of $7.5 in future periods to implement the actions approved to date. The significant majority of these liabilities will require cash payments during 2012.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt December 31, 2011, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements.Capital ResourcesWe maintain a three year, $1 billion revolving credit and competitive advance facility, which expires in November 2013. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum, which are either based on LIBOR or a floating base rate plus an applicable margin. The credit facility contains various covenants, including a financial covenant that requires our interest coverage ratio (determined in relation to our consolidated pretax income and interest expense) to equal or exceed 4:1. The credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2011, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility.We also maintain a $1 billion commercial paper program. Under this program, we may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws, for a cumulative face amount not to exceed $1 billion outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment. The commercial paper program is supported by our three year credit facility. Outstanding commercial paper effectively reduces the amount available for borrowing under the three year credit facility. At December 31, 2011, there was $709.0 outstanding under this program. For more information regarding risks associated with our ability to access certain debt markets, including the commercial paper market, see Risk Factors A general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or sudden disruption 39in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital included in Item 1A herein.In November 2010, we issued, in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, $142.0 principal amount of 2.60% Senior Notes, Series A, due November 23, 2015, $290.0 principal amount of 4.03% Senior Notes, Series B, due November 23, 2020, and $103.0 principal amount of 4.18% Senior Notes, Series C, due November 23, 2022. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, rank equal in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company, and are unconditionally guaranteed by one of the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries. The Notes require the Company to comply with an interest coverage ratio and contain customary default provisions, including cross default provisions. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.In March 2009, we issued, in a public offering, $500.0 principal amount of 5.625% Notes, due March 1, 2014 and $350.0 principal amount of 6.50% Notes, due March 1, 2019. In March 2008, we issued, in a public offering, $250.0 principal amount of 4.80% Notes, due March 1, 2013 and $250.0 principal amount of 5.75% Notes, due March 1, 2018. The proceeds from these offerings were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants in our indentures and our note purchase agreement. Such indentures and note purchase agreement do not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt. We would be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes described above at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in the event of a change in control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade. We also have outstanding $250.0 principal amount of 4.20% Notes, due July 15, 2018 and $125.0 principal amount of 4.625% Notes, due May 15, 2013. Additionally, we had $500.0 principal amount of 5.125% Notes, due in January 2011, outstanding at December 31, 2010, which has subsequently been repaid primarily with the use of commercial paper. Please refer to Note 5, Debt and Other Financing, to our 2011 Annual Report for more details.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities. We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means. Since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a portion of our existing and forecasted transactions, we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by changes in the value of the underlying transactions.We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives. The master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in some circumstances, including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of Avon prior to the merger.Interest Rate RiskWe use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure. The interest rate swaps are used to either convert our fixed rate borrowing to a variable interest rate or to unwind an existing variable interest rate swap on a fixed rate borrowing. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately 74% of our outstanding long term, fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. Our total exposure to floating interest rates was 82% at December 31, 2011, and 81% at December 31, 2010.Our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 50 basis point change (either an increase or a decrease) in interest rates prevailing at that date, sustained for one year, would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt.Foreign Currency RiskWe conduct business globally, with operations in various locations around the world. Over the past three years, approximately 83% of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. The functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency. We are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal 40course of our operations, primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities. At December 31, 2011, the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the Argentine peso, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Colombian peso, the euro, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, South Africa rand, Turkish lira, Ukrainian hryvnia and Venezuelan bolvar.We may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments.Our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to, and, therefore, cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. Based on our foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2011, the impact of a hypothetical 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. The hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at December 31, 2011, adjusted for an assumed 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these hedging contracts.Credit Risk of Financial InstrumentsWe attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements with major international financial institutions with A or higher credit ratings as issued by Standard & Poors Corporation. Our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts, swaps or options with major international financial institutions. Although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments, we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses, if any, would not be material.Non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a write off of $159.2 at December 31, 2011. In addition, in the event of non performance by such counterparties, we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.See Note 8, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, to our 2011 Annual Report for further information.
