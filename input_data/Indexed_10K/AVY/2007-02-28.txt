Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative concerning our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: Definition of Terms 17 Overview and Outlook 18 Analysis of Results of Operations 23 Results of Operations by Segment 26 Financial Condition 29 Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures 37 Related Party Transactions 37 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 38 Recent Accounting Requirements 42 Safe Harbor Statement 42 DEFINITION OF TERMS Our discussion of financial results includes several non GAAP measures to provide additional information concerning Avery Dennison Corporations (the Companys) performance. These non GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. (Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures.) We use the following terms: Organic sales growth refers to the change in sales excluding the estimated impact of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures; Core unit volume refers to a measure of sales performance that excludes the estimated impact of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, as well as changes in product mix and pricing; Segment operating income refers to income before interest and taxes; Free cash flow refers to cash flow from operations, less payments for capital expenditures, software and other deferred charges; and Working capital from continuing operations refers to working capital excluding short term debt, current assets and current liabilities of held for sale businesses. While our segment structure remained the same as reported in the prior year, in 2006, we transferred our business media division from the Retail Information Services segment into other specialty converting businesses, to align with a change in our internal reporting structure. Prior year amounts included herein have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. As a result of the sale of our raised reflective pavement marker business during 2006 (discussed below in Acquisitions and Divestitures), the discussions which follow generally reflect summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted. However, the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations. 17 Table of Contents OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Overview Sales Our sales from continuing operations increased 2% in 2006 compared to growth of 3% in 2005, reflecting the factors summarized in the following table. 2006 2005 2004 Estimated change in sales due to: Core unit volume 2 % (1 )% 8 % Pricing & product mix 1 2 (1 ) Organic sales growth 3 % 1 % 7 % Foreign currency translation 2 5 Divestitures, net of acquisitions (1 ) Reported sales growth 2 % 3 % 12 % Organic sales growth in 2006 reflected increases in most of our businesses outside of the U.S., particularly in the emerging markets of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. In the U.S., sales were approximately even with the prior year. In our North American roll materials business, reduced market share during the first quarter of 2006 (reflecting share loss related to price increases implemented in 2005 and early 2006, to offset higher raw material costs), as well as generally slow market conditions, were offset by some share gain during the second half of 2006. The benefit from growth of Avery brand products and a strong back to school season in our Office and Consumer Products segment in the U.S. was offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin private label business in that segment. Organic sales growth in 2005 reflected favorable changes in pricing and product mix, primarily due to the impact of selling price increases implemented to offset higher raw material costs. This benefit was partially offset by a decrease in core unit volume in 2005, reflecting the following factors: Loss of market share in our North American roll materials business following our implementation of selling price increases during 2005 to offset higher raw material costs The impact of an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year Accelerated purchases by Office and Consumer Products customers in advance of our 2005 selling price increases, which shifted sales into the fourth quarter of 2004. Net Income Net income increased $141 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Positive factors affecting the change in net income included: Higher sales Reduced restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2006 compared to 2005 (which included asset impairment charges related to discontinued operations) Cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives across all segments and corporate, including restructuring actions taken in 2006 and late 2005 Tax benefit and gain on divestiture of a business Benefit of a lower effective tax rate on continuing operations 18 Table of Contents Negative factors affecting the change in net income included: Stock based compensation and other employee related costs Transition costs associated with 2006 restructuring actions Increased investment in information technology and marketing Accrual for environmental remediation costs Summary Results by Segment Net Sales Operating Income 2006 2005 2006 2005 (In millions) Pressure sensitive Materials $ 3,236.3 $ 3,114.5 $ 301.2 $ 258.1 Office and Consumer Products 1,072.0 1,136.1 179.0 168.0 Retail Information Services 667.7 630.4 45.0 37.7 Other specialty converting businesses 599.9 592.5 17.2 14.1 Corporate expense (61.3 ) (53.2 ) Interest expense (55.5 ) (57.9 ) Total from continuing operations $ 5,575.9 $ 5,473.5 $ 425.6 $ 366.8 Pressure sensitive Materials (58% of net sales) Our Pressure sensitive Materials segment reported a 4% increase in sales in 2006 compared to 2005. Organic sales growth was approximately 3%, reflecting growth in our roll materials and graphics and reflective businesses in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Operating income for this segment increased 17% in 2006, reflecting higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. Operating income for this segment included restructuring costs and asset impairments in both 2006 and 2005 and transition costs in 2006. Office and Consumer Products (19% of net sales) Our Office and Consumer Products segment reported a 6% decrease in sales in 2006 compared to 2005. On an organic basis, sales declined approximately 1%, reflecting the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin private label business and decreased volume in Europe. These declines were partially offset by growth in North America for Avery brand products, a strong back to school season, and accelerated purchases by customers in advance of our 2007 selling price increases for certain product lines. Operating income for this segment increased 7% in 2006, including the benefit from cost savings from productivity improvement and restructuring initiatives. Operating income for this segment included restructuring costs, asset impairments and transition costs in both 2006 and 2005. Retail Information Services (12% of net sales) The Retail Information Services segment reported a 6% increase in sales in 2006 compared to 2005. Organic sales growth was approximately 5%, reflecting continued growth of the business in Asia, Latin America and Europe. Operating income for this segment increased 19% in 2006, reflecting higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. Operating income for this segment included restructuring costs, asset impairments and transition costs in 2006 and 2005. 19 Table of Contents Other specialty converting businesses (11% of net sales) Other specialty converting businesses reported a 1% increase in sales in 2006 compared to 2005. Organic sales growth was approximately 2%, reflecting solid growth in our specialty tape business, partially offset by weakness in other businesses. Operating income for these businesses increased 22% in 2006, reflecting sales growth and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. Operating income for these businesses included restructuring costs and asset impairments in both 2006 and 2005. Organic Sales Growth by Region We estimate organic sales growth (decline) in major regions of operation as follows: 2006 2005 2004 U.S (3 )% 5 % Europe 3 % 3 % 5 % Asia 13 % 13 % 26 % Latin America 11 % 4 % 19 % As discussed above, sales in the U.S. were approximately even with the prior year, due to slow market conditions in our Pressure sensitive Materials segment, the impact of prior year share loss in our roll materials business, and loss of sales from exiting low margin private label business in our Office and Consumer Products segment. Organic growth in Europe reflected strong growth in the east and modest growth in the west. Growth in our Asian and Latin American businesses was due to continued market expansion. Cost Reduction Actions Accrued Headcount Expenses Reduction (Dollars in millions) Q4 2005 restructuring $ 41.1 700 2006 restructuring 23.5 450 Total Q4 2005 2006 restructuring actions $ 64.6 1,150 Q4 2006 charges related to 2007 actions $ 5.1 140 During late 2005 and 2006, we implemented cost reduction actions related to restructuring, which have improved our global operating efficiencies and are expected to result in annualized pretax savings of $90 million to $100 million. We estimate that approximately $50 million of these savings (net of transition costs) were achieved in 2006, with the balance to benefit 2007. These restructuring actions resulted in headcount reductions of approximately 1,150 positions, which impacted all of our segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006. We are reinvesting some of the savings in future growth opportunities. Additional restructuring actions were identified during the fourth quarter of 2006. These actions are expected to be completed during 2007, with savings expected to benefit 2008. In 2005, we also incurred charges related to the planned divestitures of several low margin businesses and product lines, as discussed in Divestitures and Acquisitions. Restructuring charges associated with severance and asset impairments recorded during 2004 were related to the completion of the integration of the 2002 acquisition of Jackstdt into our other existing businesses. We closed a manufacturing facility in France during the first quarter of 2004 and a manufacturing facility in Italy during the second quarter of 2004. Refer to Note 10, Cost Reduction Actions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. 20 Table of Contents Effective Rate of Taxes on Income The effective tax rate was 17.2% for the full year 2006 compared with 20.4% for the full year 2005. Our effective tax rate in both years included benefits from: Changes in the geographic mix of income Continued improvements in our global tax structure Several favorable global tax audit settlements and the closure of certain tax years Release of certain valuation allowances In 2005, these benefits were partially offset by incremental expense associated with the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow, which is a non GAAP measure, is used as a measure of funds available for other corporate purposes, such as dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions, and repurchase of common stock. Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures. 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 510.8 $ 441.6 $ 516.9 Purchase of property, plant and equipment (161.9 ) (162.5 ) (178.9 ) Purchase of software and other deferred charges (33.4 ) (25.8 ) (21.8 ) Free cash flow $ 315.5 $ 253.3 $ 316.2 The increase in free cash flow in 2006 of $62 million reflects changes in assets and liabilities and higher net income compared to 2005. See Analysis of Results of Operations and Liquidity below for more information. Divestitures and Acquisitions In December 2005, we announced our plan to sell our raised reflective pavement marker business, which had sales of approximately $23 million in 2005. The divestiture of this business was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business. The results of this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations for the years presented herein. This business was previously included in the Pressure sensitive Materials segment. In December 2005, we also announced the divestiture of two product lines. These divestitures were completed in the first quarter of 2006. The first product line, which was included in the Office and Consumer Products segment, had estimated sales of $60 million in 2005, with minimal impact to income from operations. The second product line, which was included in other specialty converting businesses, had annual sales of approximately $10 million in 2005, with minimal impact to income from operations. As part of these divestitures, in 2005, we recorded severance and other employee related charges of approximately $6 million and asset impairments of approximately $9 million. These charges were included in the Other Expense, net line of our Consolidated Statement of Income, as noted in Cost Reduction Actions above. During the third quarter of 2004, we acquired Rinke Etiketten, a privately held company in Germany. The incremental impact of this acquisition on our net sales was approximately $9 million during 2004, with an additional impact of approximately $18 million in 2005. This business is included in our Retail Information Services segment. 21 Table of Contents Investigations and Legal Proceedings On October 19, 2006, we were notified by the U.S. Department of Justices Antitrust Division (DOJ) that the DOJ had decided to close its criminal investigation (initiated in April 2003) into competitive practices in the label stock industry without further action. On November 15, 2006, we announced that we had been notified by the European Commission (EC) that the EC had closed its investigation (initiated in May 2004) into competitive activities in the label stock industry with no action. In July 2004, we were notified by the Competition Law Division of the Department of Justice of Canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation. In August 2005, we were notified by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation. We are cooperating with these investigations. We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation. We are also a named defendant in a purported class action in the U.S. seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices. We have discovered instances of conduct by certain employees in China that potentially violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we have reported that conduct to authorities in the U.S. Accordingly, we expect that fines or other penalties may be incurred. We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These and other matters are reported in Note 8, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Outlook In 2007, we expect low to mid single digit revenue growth, including a modest positive effect from foreign currency translation. Our revenue expectations are subject to changes in economic and market conditions. We anticipate continued benefit from our productivity improvement initiatives. In particular, we estimate that our restructuring and business realignment efforts will reduce costs by an additional $45 million compared to 2006. However, we plan to reinvest some of the savings from these productivity improvements in growth initiatives. This reinvestment includes incremental spending of approximately $12 million to $15 million related to investments in information technology. We estimate that pretax interest expense will be approximately even with 2006, subject to changes in average debt outstanding. We expect total restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2007 will be lower than the charges taken in 2006. We anticipate an increase in our annual effective tax rate for 2007, subject to changes in tax laws and the geographic mix of income, with potentially wide variances from quarter to quarter. Reflecting these assumptions, we expect an increase in annual earnings and free cash flow in comparison with 2006. Additionally, the effect of share repurchase will benefit earnings per share in 2007. We expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be approximately $160 million to $165 million, or approximately $210 million to $225 million including software investments, funded through operating cash flows. Major capital projects in 2007 include expansion in China and India, serving both our materials and retail information services businesses. Major software investments relate to customer service and standardization initiatives. 22 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Net sales $ 5,575.9 $ 5,473.5 $ 5,317.0 Cost of products sold 4,047.5 3,997.3 3,890.4 Gross profit 1,528.4 1,476.2 1,426.6 Marketing, general and administrative expense 1,011.1 987.9 957.4 Interest expense 55.5 57.9 58.7 Other expense, net 36.2 63.6 35.2 Income from continuing operations before taxes $ 425.6 $ 366.8 $ 375.3 % % % As a Percent of Sales: Gross profit (margin) 27.4 27.0 26.8 Marketing, general and administrative expense 18.1 18.0 18.0 Income from continuing operations before taxes 7.6 6.7 7.1 Sales Sales increased 2% in 2006 compared to an increase of 3% in 2005. Organic sales growth was approximately 3% in 2006 compared to approximately 1% in 2005. Organic sales growth in 2006 reflected increases in most of our businesses in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Organic growth in Europe reflected strong growth in the east and modest growth in the west. Growth in our Asian and Latin American businesses was due to continued market expansion. On an organic basis, sales in the U.S. were approximately even in 2006, compared to a decrease of approximately 3% in 2005. In our North American roll materials business, reduced market share during the first quarter of 2006 (reflecting share loss related to price increases implemented in 2005 and early 2006 to offset higher raw material costs), as well as generally slow market conditions, were offset by some share gain during the second half of 2006. The benefit from growth of Avery brand products and a strong back to school season in our Office and Consumer Products segment in the U.S. was offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin private label business (approximate impact of $22 million) in that segment. Sales growth in 2005 was negatively impacted by an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year and accelerated purchases by Office and Consumer Products customers in advance of 2005 selling price increases, both of which contributed to higher growth in 2004. Combined, the accelerated purchases and extra week in 2004 represented an estimated $60 million to $70 million of the change in sales between 2005 and 2004. The loss of market share in our North American roll materials business also affected sales growth in 2005. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately $21 million in 2006 compared to approximately $77 million in 2005. Product line divestitures, net of incremental sales from acquisitions, reduced sales by approximately $54 million in 2006. Incremental sales from acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed approximately $19 million in 2005. Gross Profit Gross profit margin in both 2006 and 2005 benefited from our ongoing productivity improvement and cost reduction actions. 23 Table of Contents In 2006, these benefits were partially offset by: Unfavorable segment mix (faster growth in segments with lower gross profit margin as a percent of sales) Energy related cost inflation (approximately $9 million) Change in the last in, first out (LIFO) inventory reserves (approximately $9 million); refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Transition costs associated with restructuring (approximately $9 million) In 2005, these benefits were partially offset by: Unfavorable segment mix Raw material inflation in excess of selling price increases Higher costs related to our radio frequency identification (RFID) business (approximately $9 million) In 2006, we reclassified shipping and handling costs to Cost of products sold to align our businesses around a standard accounting policy. In 2005, several of our businesses included these costs in marketing, general and administrative expenses (approximately $143 million for 2006, $145 million for 2005, and $148 million for 2004); previous results included herein have been reclassified for comparability to the current year. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in 2006 and 2005 reflected the benefit of productivity improvement initiatives and cost reduction actions. In 2006, these benefits were offset by: Recognition of stock option expense (approximately $21 million) Increased spending on information systems and marketing (approximately $19 million) Increase in pension, medical and other employee related costs (approximately $12 million) In 2005, these benefits were offset by: Higher pension and medical expenses (approximately $14 million) Impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $11 million) Additional spending on the development of our RFID business (approximately $8 million), as well as other long term growth initiatives Additional spending associated with acquisitions (approximately $6 million) Interest Expense Interest expense decreased in 2006 and 2005. The decreases were due to a reduction in debt outstanding, partially offset by an increase in interest rates. Other Expense 2006 2005 2004 (In millions, pretax) Restructuring costs $ 21.1 $ 37.5 $ 23.6 Asset impairment & lease cancellation charges 8.7 28.1 11.6 Other 6.4 (2.0 ) Other expense, net $ 36.2 $ 63.6 35.2 24 Table of Contents In 2006 and 2005, Other expense, net, consisted of charges for restructuring, including severance and other employee related costs and asset impairment charges related to cost reduction actions and divestitures, as well as other items discussed below. During late 2005 and 2006, we implemented cost reduction actions related to restructuring which have improved our global operating efficiencies and are expected to result in annualized pretax savings of $90 million to $100 million. We estimate that approximately $50 million of these savings (net of transition costs) have been achieved in 2006. These restructuring actions resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 1,150 positions, which impacted all of our segments and geographic regions, and were completed in 2006. We are reinvesting some of the savings in future growth opportunities. Refer to Note 10, Cost Reduction Actions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The other items included in Other expense, net, in 2006 included: Accrual for environmental remediation costs ($13 million); refer to the Environmental section of Financial Condition below Costs related to a patent lawsuit and a divestiture ($.8 million) Gain on sale of assets ($5.3 million) Gain on curtailment and settlement of a pension obligation ($1.6 million) Gain on sale of an investment ($10.5 million), partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Avery Dennison Foundation ($10 million) In 2005, other items included in Other expense, net, consisted of the gain on the sale of assets, partially offset by costs related to a patent lawsuit. In 2004, Other expense, net, consisted of charges for productivity improvement actions, primarily related to the completion of the Jackstdt integration actions. Net Income: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions, except per share amounts) Income from continuing operations before taxes $ 425.6 $ 366.8 $ 375.3 Taxes on income 73.1 75.0 94.3 Income from continuing operations 352.5 291.8 281.0 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 14.7 (65.4 ) (1.3 ) Net income $ 367.2 $ 226.4 $ 279.7 Net income per common share $ 3.68 $ 2.26 $ 2.80 Net income per common share, assuming dilution $ 3.66 $ 2.25 $ 2.78 Net income as a percent of sales 6.6% 4.1% 5.3% Effective tax rate from continuing operations 17.2% 20.4% 25.1% Taxes on Income Our 2006 effective tax rate included the benefit of changes in the geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our global tax structure, as well as the following: Net benefit from several favorable global tax audit settlements (approximately $8.1 million) Release of certain valuation allowances (approximately $5.2 million) 25 Table of Contents Our 2005 effective tax rate included the benefit of changes in the geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our global tax structure, as well as the following: Release of certain valuation allowances (approximately $15.6 million) Net benefit from several favorable global tax audit settlements (approximately $9 million) In 2005, these benefits were partially offset by the incremental expense of $13.5 million associated with the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations includes the divestiture of our raised reflective pavement markers business as noted in the Overview section above. The divestiture of this business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit ($14.9 million) due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business and a gain on sale of $1.3 million. Based on our estimated value of the raised reflective pavement markers business in 2005, we concluded that associated goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were impaired. The resulting pretax impairment charge was approximately $74 million in 2005. Income from discontinued operations included net sales of approximately $7 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005 and $24 million in 2004. Refer to the Discontinued Operations section of Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Pressure sensitive Materials Segment 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Net sales including intersegment sales $ 3,397.8 $ 3,277.7 $ 3,154.1 Less intersegment sales (161.5 ) (163.2 ) (169.3 ) Net sales $ 3,236.3 $ 3,114.5 $ 2,984.8 Operating income(1) 301.2 258.1 221.4 (1) Includes restructuring, asset impairment & lease cancellation charges and accrual for patent lawsuit, net of gain on sale of assets $ 9.3 $ 23.0 $ 34.4 Net Sales Sales in our Pressure sensitive Materials segment increased 4% in both 2006 and 2005. Organic sales growth was approximately 3% in 2006 and 2% in 2005. Organic sales growth in 2006 reflected growth in our roll materials and graphics and reflective businesses in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Organic growth in 2005 reflected the positive impact of pricing and product mix, resulting from increased selling prices implemented to offset higher raw material costs. The extra week in the 2004 fiscal year contributed to slower growth in 2005. In our North American roll materials business, 2005 sales declined on an organic basis at a low single digit rate, while 2006 sales were even with the prior year. The loss of market share following our implementation of selling price increases in 2005 and early 2006 contributed to this decline. Both years were also affected by generally slow market conditions. Some share gain during the second half of 2006 offset these factors. 26 Table of Contents Our roll materials business in Europe experienced low single digit organic sales growth in 2006, reflecting strong growth in the east. In 2005, this business experienced high single digit organic sales growth reflecting solid growth in the west and stronger growth in the east. Market expansion contributed to double digit organic sales growth in the roll materials business in Asia in both 2006 and 2005. The roll materials business in Latin America experienced high single digit organic sales growth in 2006, resulting from market expansion. In 2005, this region experienced low single digit organic sales growth due to market expansion and selling price increases, partially offset by loss of market share from selling price increases and loss of sales with a large customer. Our graphics and reflective business experienced mid single digit organic sales growth in 2006, as strong international growth was partially offset by a decline in the U.S. On an organic basis, sales in this business were unchanged in 2005. The changes in reported sales for the segment included a favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $15 million in 2006 and approximately $58 million in 2005. Operating Income Increased operating income in 2006 and 2005 reflected higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. Operating income for all years reflected restructuring, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges. In 2006, operating income was also impacted by transition costs associated with restructuring and stock option expense. Office and Consumer Products Segment 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Net sales including intersegment sales $ 1,073.8 $ 1,138.1 $ 1,174.7 Less intersegment sales (1.8 ) (2.0 ) (2.2 ) Net sales $ 1,072.0 $ 1,136.1 $ 1,172.5 Operating income(1) 179.0 168.0 186.4 (1) Includes restructuring and asset impairment charges and net gain from product line divestiture $ (2.3 ) $ 21.8 $ .5 Net Sales Sales in our Office and Consumer Products segment decreased 6% in 2006, while sales decreased 3% in 2005. The decline in reported sales in 2006 reflected the impact of a product line divestiture in Europe (approximately $51 million). Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in reported sales of approximately $1 million in 2006 and $8 million in 2005. On an organic basis, sales declined approximately 1% in 2006. The decline reflected the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin private label business at the end of 2005 (approximately $22 million), partially offset by growth in Avery brand products, a strong back to school season in North America, and accelerated purchases by customers in late 2006 in advance of our 2007 selling price increases for certain product lines. In 2005, sales on an organic basis declined 4%, reflecting a shift in volume to late 2004 (due to customers accelerated purchases in advance of selling price increases effective January 1, 2005), as well as the benefit from an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year. Declines in core unit volume in 2005 were partially offset by increased selling prices, implemented to offset higher raw material costs. 27 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income in 2006 reflected cost savings from productivity improvement and restructuring actions, partially offset by associated transition costs, higher raw material and energy related costs, increased marketing costs, an increase in the LIFO reserve, and stock option expense. Operating income in 2005 reflected charges related to restructuring, asset impairment and net losses associated with product line divestitures, partially offset by cost savings from restructuring and productivity initiatives. The selling price increases in 2005 offset the cumulative effect of raw material inflation over the 2004 to 2005 period. Retail Information Services Segment 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Net sales including intersegment sales $ 671.1 $ 637.1 $ 599.5 Less intersegment sales (3.4 ) (6.7 ) (6.8 ) Net sales $ 667.7 $ 630.4 $ 592.7 Operating income(1) 45.0 37.7 43.4 (1) Includes restructuring, asset impairment & lease cancellation charges $ 11.2 $ 7.5 $ .3 Net Sales Sales in our Retail Information Services segment increased 6% in both 2006 and 2005. The increase in both years reflected continued growth of the business in Asia, Latin America and Europe, as well as incremental sales from acquisitions, net of product line divestitures. Organic sales growth was approximately 5% in 2006 and 2% in 2005. The impact of acquisitions, net of product line divestitures, was approximately $3 million in 2006 and $21 million in 2005. Foreign currency translation contributed to the increase in sales by approximately $3 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2005. Operating Income Operating income in 2006 and 2005 benefited from productivity improvement actions, including the migration of production from Hong Kong to lower cost facilities in mainland China. Benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by increased spending for information systems, stock option expense and other incremental employee related costs in 2006, and higher costs associated with growth initiatives in 2005. Operating income in both years included charges for restructuring, asset impairment, and lease cancellation.

In 2005, organic sales growth of 4% reflected growth in most businesses. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately $1 million in 2006 and $4 million in 2005. Operating Income Operating income for these businesses increased in 2006, reflecting cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by stock option expense. Operating income in both years included charges for restructuring and asset impairment. The change in operating income in 2005 primarily reflected incremental costs related to the development of the RFID business.

In 2006, cash flow provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital, as shown below: Uses of cash Other current assets primarily reflected the timing of collection of value added tax receivables in Europe Inventories reflected increased purchases to support higher sales and customer service initiatives Long term retirement benefits and other liabilities reflected benefit payments, partially offset by contributions of approximately $39 million to our pension and postretirement health benefit plans 29 Table of Contents Sources of cash Accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected the timing of payments and increased inventory In 2005, cash flow provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital, as shown below: Uses of cash Accounts receivable reflected higher sales and the timing of collections, partially offset by a decrease in the average days sales outstanding Income taxes reflected the timing of payments made, as well as the current year tax accrual Long term retirement benefits and other liabilities reflected contributions of approximately $46 million to our pension and postretirement health benefit plans, partially offset by benefit payments Inventory reflected higher raw material purchases to support growth and business expansion Sources of cash Accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected the timing of payments and accruals, including accrual for restructuring charges Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Purchase of property, plant and equipment $ (161.9 ) $ (162.5 ) $ (178.9 ) Purchase of software and other deferred charges (33.4 ) (25.8 ) (21.8 ) Proceeds from sale of businesses and investments 35.4 Other, net 5.0 20.7 (16.2 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (154.9 ) $ (167.6 ) $ (216.9 ) Capital Spending Our major capital projects in 2006 included investments for expansion in China and India serving both our materials and retail information services businesses, as well as spending related to our new films coater in the U.S. Our major information technology projects in 2006 included system improvements for our Retail Information Services segment and our materials businesses. Proceeds from Sale of Businesses In 2006, we sold a long term investment and divested both a product line in Europe and the raised reflective pavement marker business.

Short term variable rate commercial paper borrowings were $154.4 million at December 30, 2006 (weighted average interest rate of 5.0%) compared to $255.3 million at December 31, 2005 (weighted average interest rate of 2.3%). We had medium term notes of $160 million outstanding at year end 2006 and 2005. In 2005, medium term notes of $73 million were paid on maturity. Outstanding medium term notes have maturities from 2007 through 2025 and accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.9% to 7.5%. In August 2004, we issued $150 million in floating rate senior notes due in 2007 under our 2001 shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These notes are callable at par. Shareholders Equity Our shareholders equity was $1.68 billion at year end 2006, compared to $1.51 billion at year end 2005. Our annual dividend per share increased to $1.57 in 2006 from $1.53 in 2005. Share Repurchases On October 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 5 million shares of the Companys stock for our repurchase program, resulting in a total authorization of approximately 7.4 million shares of the Companys stock at that date. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares. As of December 30, 2006, approximately 4.9 million shares were available for repurchase under the Board of Directors authorization. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repurchased approximately ..7 million shares under an agreement related to the L&E Packaging (L&E) acquisition and recorded such amount to treasury stock. (See the Other section of Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements below for further details.) Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts Long lived Assets Goodwill increased $43 million during 2006 primarily due to foreign currency translation (approximately $32 million) and goodwill associated with an acquisition (approximately $10 million). Other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions decreased $3 million during 2006 due to amortization expense recorded during 2006 (approximately $11 million) partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $6 million) and acquired intangibles associated with an acquisition (approximately $2 million). Other assets decreased approximately $64 million during 2006 due primarily to a decrease in assets related to pension and postretirement benefits (approximately $68 million). Refer to Note 6, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the change in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158. Other Shareholders Equity Accounts The value of our employee stock benefit trusts increased $51 million in 2006, due to an increase in the market value of shares held in the trusts (approximately $122 million), partially offset by the issuance of shares under our stock and incentive plans (approximately $71 million). 31 Table of Contents Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $39 million, due to foreign currency translation, partially offset by the after tax impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 (approximately $57 million). Refer to Note 6, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effect of Foreign Currency International operations generate approximately 55% of our net sales. Our future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates. To reduce our income statement exposure to transactions in foreign currencies, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts, where available and appropriate. Impact of Foreign Currency Translation: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Change in net sales $ 21 $ 77 $ 207 Change in net income 2 2 8 While there was a benefit from foreign currency translation in 2006, this benefit was lower compared to prior years. The benefit to sales in 2006 primarily reflected a benefit from currencies in Canada, Brazil, Korea and China, partially offset by a negative impact of the Euro and currencies in South Africa and Australia. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is smaller than the impact on net sales, because our products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold. As a result, the impact of foreign exchange rates on sales is matched with a partially offsetting impact on reported expenses, thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income. Our net income for 2005 and 2004 included translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies, which included Turkey. For accounting purposes, operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy, based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years. Operations in hyperinflationary economies consist of our operations in the Dominican Republic, which use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. These operations were not significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In 2006, Turkey was removed from hyperinflationary status. Analysis of Selected Financial Ratios We utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance, as discussed below. Working Capital Ratio Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities, excluding working capital of held for sale business), as a percent of net sales, decreased in 2006 primarily due to an increase in short term debt. Working capital from continuing operations, as a percent of net sales, is shown below. We use this non GAAP measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing activities. (Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures.) The timing of financing activities is not necessarily related to our current operations and would tend to distort the working capital ratio from period to period. Our objective is to minimize our investment in working capital from operations by reducing this ratio, to maximize cash flow and return on investment. 32 Table of Contents Working capital from continuing operations: 2006 2005 (In millions) (A) Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities; excludes working capital of held for sale businesses) $ (43.4 ) $ 31.0 Reconciling item: Short term and current portion of long term debt 466.4 364.7 (B) Working capital from continuing operations $ 423.0 $ 395.7 (C) Net sales $ 5,575.9 $ 5,473.5 Working capital, as a percent of net sales(A)(C) (.8 )% .6 % Working capital from continuing operations, as a percent of net sales(B)(C) 7.6 % 7.2 % As a percent of sales, working capital from continuing operations in 2006 weakened compared to 2005. In 2006, the change primarily reflected a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and income taxes payable. Working capital changes included the impact of currency. Accounts Receivable Ratio The average number of days sales outstanding was 58 days in 2006 and 2005, calculated using a four quarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the average daily sales for the year. Inventory Ratio Average inventory turnover was 8.5 in 2006 compared to 8.8 in 2005, calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a four quarter average inventory balance. The decrease is due to higher average inventory levels, primarily to support customer service initiatives. Debt Ratios Year End Requirement 2006 2005 Total debt to total capital 36.5% 41.8% Debt covenant ratios: Total debt to earnings before other expense, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Not to exceed 3.5:1.0 1.4:1.0 1.6:1.0 Earnings before other expense, interest and taxes to interest At least 3.5:1.0 9.3:1.0 8.4:1.0 The decrease in the total debt to total capital ratio in 2006 was due to a decrease in total debt outstanding and an increase in shareholders equity. Our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of income. We were in compliance with these covenants as shown in the table above. The fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. At year end, the fair value of our total debt, including short term borrowings, was $963 million in 2006 and $1.1 billion in 2005. Shareholders Equity Ratios 2006 2005 2004 Return on average shareholders equity 22.5 % 14.6 % 19.9 % Return on average total capital 15.6 10.1 12.1 33 Table of Contents Increases in these ratios in 2006 compared to 2005 were primarily due to higher net income. These ratios are computed using actual net income and a five quarter average denominator for equity and total debt accounts. Capital Resources Capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt financing. We maintain adequate financing arrangements at competitive rates. These financing arrangements consist of our commercial paper programs in the U.S. and Europe, committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we operate, callable commercial notes, and long term debt, including medium term notes. Capital from Debt Our total debt decreased approximately $120 million in 2006 to $968 million compared to year end 2005, reflecting payments of debt, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation. In July 2004, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with ten domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of $525 million, expiring July 16, 2009. We use the financing available under this agreement as a commercial paper back up facility and to finance other corporate requirements. There was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of year end 2006 and 2005. In addition, we have a 364 day revolving credit facility with a foreign bank to provide up to Euro 30 million ($39.6 million) in borrowings through July 31, 2007. With the approval of the bank, we may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis. Our intention is to negotiate an extension of this facility in 2007. Financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements of our European operations. As of year end 2006, $26.3 million was outstanding under this agreement. We had standby letters of credit outstanding of $77.1 million and $81.2 million at the end of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately $359 million at year end 2006. Our uncommitted lines of credit do not have a commitment expiration date and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to permit the issuance of up to $500 million in debt and equity securities. Proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing debt, and for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. As of December 30, 2006, no securities had been issued under this registration statement. Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short term and long term financing. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings. When determining a credit rating, the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position, business outlook, consistency of cash flows, debt level and liquidity, geographic dispersion and management team.

We enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation. The terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations, except for the facility in Mentor, Ohio as noted below. The table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms of one year or more. On September 9, 2005, we completed the lease financing for a commercial facility (the Facility) located in Mentor, Ohio, used primarily for the new headquarters and research center for our roll materials division. The Facility consists generally of land, buildings, equipment and office furnishings. We have leased the Facility under an operating lease arrangement, which contains a residual value guarantee of $33.4 million. We do not expect the residual value of the Facility to be less than the amount guaranteed. We did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end 2006 in the table of contractual obligations above, because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems. Investigations and Legal Proceedings On October 19, 2006, we were notified by the DOJ that the DOJ had decided to close its criminal investigation (initiated in April 2003) into competitive practices in the label stock industry without further action. On November 15, 2006, we announced that we had been notified by the EC that the EC had closed its investigation (initiated in May 2004) into the Companys competitive activities in the label stock industry, with no action. In July 2004, we were notified by the Competition Law Division of the Department of Justice of Canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation. In August 2005, we were notified by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation. We are cooperating with these investigations. We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation. We are also a named defendant in a purported class action in the U.S. seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices. We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These matters are reported in Note 8, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Table of Contents Environmental We have been designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and or other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites, which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and or groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon. We are participating with other PRPs at such sites, and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the EPA or other governmental authorities. We have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a PRP, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued. During the third quarter of 2006, we recognized an additional liability of $13 million for estimated environmental remediation costs for a former operating facility, for which $2 million had been accrued in the second quarter of 2006. The amount accrued represents the lower end of the current estimated range of $15 million to $17 million for costs expected to be incurred. We considered additional information provided by outside consultants in revising our previous estimates of expected costs. This estimate could change depending on various factors such as modification of currently planned remedial actions, change in site conditions, change in the estimated time to complete remediation, change in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors. Other amounts currently accrued are not significant to our consolidated financial position, and based upon current information, we believe that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other In 2005, we contacted relevant authorities in the U.S. and reported the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our reflectives business in China, and involved, among other things, impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments. The payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration. Corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken. Sales of our reflectives business in China in 2005 were approximately $7 million. Based on findings to date, no changes to our previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters. However, we expect that fines or other penalties may be incurred. While we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, we believe that our behavior in detecting, investigating, responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably. We and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our business. Based upon current information, we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us. We provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized. These costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units, cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage. As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary. 36 Table of Contents We participate in receivable financing programs, both domestically and internationally, with several financial institutions whereby we may request advances from these financial institutions. At December 30, 2006, we guaranteed approximately $22 million of these advances. We also guaranteed up to approximately $22 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries obligations to their suppliers as of December 30, 2006. In connection with the L&E acquisition in 2002, we issued approximately .7 million shares at $63.08 per share. We also entered into an agreement with L&E whereby in the event the value of our common shares fell below the price of the shares that were issued to L&E (adjusted for dividends received), during the period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007, L&E had the option to exercise a true up right. Upon exercise of this true up right, we had the option to (1) pay the difference in value to L&E, in the form of (a) cash or (b) common shares, or (2) repurchase the shares at the issued share price, adjusted for dividends paid. The true up obligation was reduced by any shares sold by L&E to third parties. During 2005, L&E sold 44,603 shares to third parties. On October 20, 2005, L&E notified us that it was exercising its true up right under the agreement for the remaining approximately ..7 million shares. We repurchased the remaining shares under the agreement for $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. USES AND LIMITATIONS OF NON GAAP MEASURES Our presented non GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative (for example, divestitures and acquisitions), from certain of our GAAP measures, management believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Companys core or underlying operating results. These non GAAP measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. Limitations associated with the use of our non GAAP measures include (1) the exclusion of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the calculation of organic sales growth; (2) the exclusion of mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchase, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash flow; and (3) the exclusion of short term debt from the calculation of working capital ratio from continuing operations. While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that supplemental non GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Companys performance and operating trends. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS From time to time, we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties. We believe that such transactions are at arms length and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. One of our directors, Peter W. Mullin is the chairman, chief executive officer and a director of MC Insurance Services, Inc. (MC), Mullin Insurance Services, Inc. (MINC), and PWM Insurance Services, Inc. (PWM), executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents. Mr. Mullin is also the majority stockholder of MC, MINC and PWM (collectively referred to as the Mullin Companies). We paid premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the Mullin Companies in connection with several of our employee benefit plans. The Mullin Companies have advised us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and renewal of this insurance. Approximately 50% of these commissions were allocated to and used by MC Insurance Agency Services, LLC, and MullinTBG Insurance Agency Services (affiliates of MC) to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants under several of our employee benefit plans. The Mullin Companies own a minority interest in M Financial 37 Table of Contents Holdings, Inc. (MFH). Substantially all of the life insurance policies, which we placed through the Mullin Companies in 2006 and prior years, are issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and M Life Insurance Company (M Life), a wholly owned subsidiary of MFH. Reinsurance returns earned by M Life are determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or positive, depending upon the results of M Lifes aggregate reinsurance pool, which consists of the insured lives reinsured by M Life. The Mullin Companies have advised us that they participated in net reinsurance gains of M Life. None of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations.

These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and which require us to make difficult, subjective and or complex judgments. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. We believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, accounts receivable allowances, inventory and inventory reserves, long lived asset impairments, pensions and postretirement benefits, income taxes, stock based compensation, restructuring and severance costs and litigation. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, pricing is determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Furthermore, sales, provisions for estimated returns, and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks and rewards of ownership. Sales terms are generally f.o.b. (free on board) shipping point or f.o.b. destination, depending upon local business customs. For most regions in which we operate, f.o.b. shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded at the time of shipment, because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred. In certain regions, notably in Europe, f.o.b. destination terms are generally utilized and sales are recorded when the products are delivered to the customers delivery site, because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred. Actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances. Sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate. Volume, promotional, price, cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales. Rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold. These estimates 38 Table of Contents are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products. We review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available. Sales Returns and Allowances Sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our customers (both affiliated and non affiliated) for the return of unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of return. We accrue for returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the products sold and historical experience for such products. We record these allowances based on the following factors: (i) customer specific allowances; and (ii) an estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues not yet identified. Accounts Receivable Allowances We are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy, historical experience and future expectations. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value. We record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors: (i) customer specific allowances; (ii) amounts based upon an aging schedule; and (iii) an estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues not yet identified. No single customer represented 10% or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2006 and 2005. However, our ten largest customers at year end 2006 represented approximately 18% of trade accounts receivable and consisted of six customers of our Office and Consumer Products segment, three customers of our Pressure sensitive Materials segment and one customer of both these segments. The financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis. Inventory and Inventory Reserves Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials, work in progress or finished goods. Cost is determined using methods that approximate both the first in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO) methods. Inventories valued using the LIFO method comprised 29% and 32% of inventories before LIFO adjustment at year end 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys international operations are on the FIFO basis of inventory cost accounting. U.S. operations use both FIFO and LIFO. Our limited use of the LIFO valuation methodology reflects the tax basis election in place at the time of previous acquisitions of businesses in the U.S. Inventory reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess and slow moving inventory. We use estimates to record these reserves. Slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory. Long lived Asset Impairments We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of long lived assets are determined not to be recoverable. Impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value. Fair value is typically determined using quoted market prices, if available, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our long lived assets. 39 Table of Contents Pensions and Postretirement Benefits In December 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R): a) Recognition of the funded status of the Companys defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan (with a corresponding reversal of minimum pension liability under SFAS No. 87) b) Recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations remaining from the initial application of SFAS Nos. 87 and 106 as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax c) Measurement of the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the Companys fiscal year end d) Disclosure of additional information about the effects of the amortization of gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations (remaining from the initial application of SFAS Nos. 87 and 106) on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care costs, future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost. Discount Rate We, in consultation with our actuaries, annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. In the U.S., our discount rate is determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans. Long term Return on Assets We determine the long term rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets, taking into consideration that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater return over the long run. Additionally, current market conditions, such as interest rates, are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. Healthcare Cost Trend Rate Our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a cash basis. For measurement purposes, a 9% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2007. This rate is expected to decrease to approximately 5% by 2011. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future sources of income such as forecasted earnings, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning. 40 Table of Contents In the event we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets is charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if later it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, we would release the previously provided valuation allowance. We calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent years. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to managements assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we began recognizing expense for stock based compensation to comply with the provisions of the reissued SFAS No. 123(R), using the modified prospective application transition method. As permitted by this transition method, results for the prior periods have not been restated. In addition, we continued to recognize compensation cost related to outstanding unvested awards as of December 31, 2005 under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123. Stock based compensation expense for all awards granted after December 31, 2005 was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Valuation of Stock Options Our stock based compensation expense is the estimated fair value of options granted, amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of each of our stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. This model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and the expected life of the options. Expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend divided by the 12 month average monthly stock price prior to grant. Expected volatility for options granted during 2006 was based on both historical and implied volatility. Expected volatility for options granted prior to 2006 was based on historical volatility of our stock price. Risk free rate was based on the average of the weekly T Bond rate over the expected option term. Expected term was determined based on historical experience under our stock option plans. Forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical data of our stock option forfeitures over the last twelve years. Certain of the assumptions used above are based on managements estimates. As such, if factors change and such factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates, our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different in the future. We have not capitalized costs associated with stock based compensation. Accounting for Income Taxes for Stock based Compensation We elected to use the short cut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee stock based compensation awards. 41 Table of Contents Restructuring and Severance Costs We account for restructuring costs including severance and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the guidance provided in SFAS No. 112, Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, and SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. In the U.S., we have a severance pay plan (Pay Plan), which provides eligible employees with severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination due to qualifying cost reduction actions. We calculate severance pay using the severance benefit formula under the Pay Plan. Accordingly, we record provisions for such amounts and other related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set forth under SFAS No. 112. In the absence of a Pay Plan, liability for severance and other employee related costs are recognized when the liability is incurred and follow the guidance of SFAS No. 146. Litigation and Environmental We are currently involved in various lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we accrue estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. The ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results of operations should our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued. RECENT ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS During 2006, we adopted several accounting and financial disclosure requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) and Financial Interpretations by the staff of the FASB. The requirements with the most significant impact were the reissued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). (Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.) SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT The matters discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain estimates, assumptions, projections and or expectations regarding future events, which may or may not occur. Words such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, guidance, intend, may, objective, plan, potential, project, seek, shall, should, target, will, would, or variations thereof and other expressions, which refer to future events and trends, identify forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements, and financial or other business targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results, performance or achievements of the Company expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 30, 2006, and include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new production facilities, timely development and successful market acceptance of new products, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions, impact of competitive products and pricing, business mix shift, credit risks, ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements, fluctuations in pension, insurance and employee benefit costs, successful integration of acquisitions, successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment, customer and supplier concentrations, financial condition and inventory strategies of customers, changes in customer order patterns, loss of significant contract(s) or customer(s), legal proceedings, including the Canadian Department of Justice and Australian Competition Consumer Commission investigations into 42 Table of Contents industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof or of the recently concluded investigations by the DOJ and the EC (including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, and a purported class action related to alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation), impact of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act based on issues in China, changes in governmental regulations, fluctuations in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations, changes in economic or political conditions, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, impact of epidemiological events on the economy, the Companys customers and suppliers, and other factors. The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial expectations in the near term include (1) the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for the Companys products; (2) the impact of competitors actions, including expansion in key markets, product offerings and pricing; (3) the impact of changes in raw material and energy related costs and associated changes in selling prices; (4) potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and or investigations regarding competitive activities, including possible fines, penalties, judgments or settlements; and (5) the ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions. The Companys forward looking statements represent judgment only on the dates such statements were made. By making such forward looking statements, the Company assumes no duty to update them to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or circumstances, other than as may be required by law. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency, interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes. Our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income. Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings. In connection with the issuance of the $250 million 10 year senior notes in 2003, we settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss of approximately $32.5 million. The loss is currently being amortized to interest expense over 10 years, which corresponds to the term of the related debt. Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations. These amounts are not material to our financial statements. In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions, other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price risk and litigation risk, which are not represented in the analyses that follow. 43 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Value At Risk We use a Value At Risk (VAR) model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts. This approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions. Firm commitments, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were included in the model. Forecasted transactions, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency. The volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on two year historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks. A 95% confidence level was used for a one day time horizon. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately $.5 million at year end 2006. Interest Rate Sensitivity An assumed 40 basis point move in interest rates (10% of our weighted average interest rate on floating rate debt) affecting our variable rate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on our 2006 earnings.
