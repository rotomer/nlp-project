Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative concerning our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: Definition of Terms 15 Overview and Outlook 16 Analysis of Results of Operations 20 Results of Operations by Segment 23 Financial Condition 26 Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures 35 Related Party Transactions 36 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 36 Recent Accounting Requirements 41 Safe Harbor Statement 41 DEFINITION OF TERMS Our discussion of financial results includes several non GAAP measures to provide additional information concerning Avery Dennison Corporations (the Companys) performance. These non GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the presentation of our financial results, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures. We use the following terms: Organic sales growth refers to the change in sales excluding the estimated impact of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures; Segment operating income refers to income before interest and taxes; Free cash flow refers to cash flow from operations, less payments for capital expenditures, software and other deferred charges; and Operational working capital refers to trade accounts receivable and inventories, net of accounts payable. Change in Accounting Method Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, we changed our method of accounting for inventories for our U.S. operations from a combination of the use of the first in, first out (FIFO) and the last in, first out (LIFO) methods to the FIFO method. The inventories for our international operations continue to be valued using the FIFO method. We believe the change is preferable as the FIFO method better reflects the current value of inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; provides better matching of revenue and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income; provides uniformity across our operations with respect to the method for inventory accounting; and enhances comparability with peers. Furthermore, this application of the FIFO method will be consistent with our accounting of inventories for U.S. income tax purposes. 15 Table of Contents As a result of the accounting change discussed above and the sale of our raised reflective pavement marker business during 2006 (discussed below in Divestitures), the discussions which follow reflect our restated results for the accounting change, as well as summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted. However, the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations. OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Overview Sales Our sales from continuing operations increased 13% in 2007 compared to growth of 2% in 2006, driven primarily by the acquisition of Paxar Corporation (Paxar) and currency translation. Due to the diverse mix of our businesses and the expansion of our Retail Information Services segment, the allocation of organic sales growth into its components of volume growth and price and mix have become less useful in our analysis. We will continue to provide this information for those segments where it is useful. Estimated change in sales due to: 2007 2006 2005 Organic sales growth 1 % 3 % 1 % Foreign currency translation 5 2 Acquisitions, net of divestitures 8 (1 ) Reported sales growth(1) 13 % 2 % 3 % (1) Columns may not sum due to rounding Organic sales growth of 1% in 2007 and 3% in 2006 reflected increases in most of our businesses outside of the U.S., particularly in the emerging markets of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Organic sales growth (or decline) by our major regions of operation was as follows: 2007 2006 2005 U.S. (4 )% (3 )% Europe 3 % 3 % 3 % Asia 9 % 13 % 13 % Latin America 4 % 11 % 4 % Outside of the U.S., sales increased on an organic basis by 4% and 5% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to market expansion and share gain in certain businesses. In the U.S., sales on an organic basis declined 4% in 2007 due primarily to the slowdown in the U.S. retail environment, particularly in our Retail Information Services and Office and Consumer Products segments, as retailers lowered inventories in the face of slowing consumer demand. Our roll materials businesses in North America and Europe also experienced soft market conditions, especially in the second half of the year. These conditions, combined with capacity and demand imbalances, impacted pricing in these markets as well. In 2006, U.S. sales were approximately even with 2005. The North American roll materials business was weak due to market share loss (related to price increases implemented in 2005 and early 2006, to offset higher raw material costs), as well as generally slow market conditions. The benefit from growth of Avery brand products and a strong back to school season in our Office and Consumer Products segment in the U.S. was offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin private label business in that segment. Net Income Net income decreased $70 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Negative factors affecting net income included: Higher interest expense and amortization of intangibles related to the Paxar acquisition 16 Table of Contents Transition costs related to the integration of Paxar operations and other restructuring actions Higher asset impairment and restructuring charges (including acquisition related charges) More competitive pricing environment and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business Higher raw material costs Higher effective tax rate Positive factors affecting net income included: Higher sales, including sales from the Paxar acquisition, and a benefit from foreign currency translation Cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives, including savings from restructuring actions Acquisitions On June 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Paxar Corporation (Paxar), a global leader in retail tag, ticketing, and branding systems. The combination of the Paxar business into our Retail Information Services segment increases our presence in the expanding and fragmented retail information and brand identification market, combines complementary strengths and broadens the range of our product and service capabilities, improves our ability to meet customer demands for product innovation and improved quality of service, and facilitates expansion into new product and geographic segments. The integration of this acquisition into our operations is also expected to result in significant cost synergies. Refer to the Outlook section herein for further information. See Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Divestitures In December 2005, we announced our plan to sell our raised reflective pavement marker business, which had sales of approximately $23 million in 2005. The divestiture of this business was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business. The results of this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations for the years presented herein. This business was previously included in the Pressure sensitive Materials segment. In December 2005, we also announced the divestiture of two product lines. These divestitures were completed in the first quarter of 2006. The first product line, which was included in the Office and Consumer Products segment, had estimated sales of $60 million in 2005, with minimal impact to income from operations. The second product line, which was included in other specialty converting businesses, had annual sales of approximately $10 million in 2005, with minimal impact to income from operations. As part of these divestitures, in 2005, we recorded severance and other employee related charges of approximately $6 million and asset impairments of approximately $9 million. These charges were included in the Other Expense, net line of our Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 10, Cost Reduction Actions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Cost Reduction Actions Accrued Headcount (Dollars in millions) Expense(1) Reduction Q4 2006 restructuring $ 5.1 140 2007 restructuring (excluding Paxar integration related actions) 26.3 415 Total Q4 2006 2007 restructuring actions $ 31.4 555 (1) Includes severance, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges From late 2006 through the end of 2007, we initiated new cost reduction actions that are expected to yield annualized pretax savings of $45 million to $50 million, in addition to cost synergies from the integration of Paxar discussed below. In 2007, savings from these actions, net of transition costs, were approximately $5 million. 17 Table of Contents Incremental savings in 2008 associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $30 million, with the balance expected to be realized in 2009. These restructuring actions result in headcount reductions of approximately 555 positions, impacting all of our segments and geographic regions. During 2007 and 2006, we realized annualized pretax savings (net of transition costs) of over $90 million, resulting from restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005. These restructuring actions resulted in headcount reductions of approximately 1,150 positions, which impacted all of our segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006. In 2005, we also incurred charges related to the planned divestitures of several low margin businesses and product lines, as discussed in the Divestitures section. Refer to Note 10, Cost Reduction Actions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Paxar Acquisition related Actions Paxar Acquisition Headcount (Dollars in millions) related costs(1) Reduction 2007 Restructuring (PL) $ 31.2 200 2007 Transition costs (PL) 43.0 Purchase Price Adjustments 27.7 855 Total Paxar integration actions $ 101.9 1,055 Change in control costs (Purchase price adjustment) 27.1 Total Paxar acquisition related costs $ 129.0 (1) Includes severance, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges In 2007, cost synergies resulting from the integration of Paxar were approximately $20 million. Incremental cost synergies expected to be achieved through 2010 are discussed in the Outlook section below. These integration actions result in headcount reductions of approximately 1,055 positions in our Retail Information Services segment. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Note 10, Cost Reduction Actions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Effective Rate of Taxes on Income The effective tax rate was 19.1% for the full year 2007 compared with 17.6% for the full year 2006. Unlike 2007, our effective tax rate for 2006 benefited from the following events: Several favorable tax audit settlements in various jurisdictions and the closure of certain tax years Release of certain valuation allowances 18 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow, which is a non GAAP measure, refers to cash flow from operating activities less spending on property, plant, equipment, software and other deferred charges. We use free cash flow as a measure of funds available for other corporate purposes, such as dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions, and repurchases of common stock. Management believes that this measure provides meaningful supplemental information to our investors to assist them in their financial analysis of the Company. Management believes that it is appropriate to measure cash after spending on property, plant, and equipment, software and other deferred charges because such spending is considered integral to maintaining or expanding our underlying business. This measure is not intended to represent the residual cash available for discretionary purposes. Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures section for further information regarding limitations of this measure. (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 499.4 $ 510.8 $ 441.6 Purchase of property, plant and equipment (190.5 ) (161.9 ) (162.5 ) Purchase of software and other deferred charges (64.3 ) (33.4 ) (25.8 ) Free cash flow $ 244.6 $ 315.5 $ 253.3 The decrease in free cash flow in 2007 of $71 million reflects higher spending on property, plant and equipment and software and other deferred charges, as well as lower net income compared to 2006. See Analysis of Results of Operations and the Liquidity section of Financial Condition below for more information. Investigations and Legal Proceedings We previously announced that we had been notified by the European Commission, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the Competition Law Department of the Department of Justice of Canada and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of their respective criminal investigations into competitive practices in the label stock industry. We cooperated with all of these investigations, and all, except the Australian investigation which is continuing, have been terminated without further action by the authorities. We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation. We have discovered instances of conduct by certain employees in China that potentially violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We have reported that conduct to authorities in the U.S. and we believe it is possible that fines or other penalties may be incurred. We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These and other matters are reported in Note 8, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Outlook In 2008, we anticipate a high single digit to low double digit rate of revenue growth, including both the benefit from the Paxar acquisition (approximately 6.5% benefit) and a modest benefit from foreign currency translation based on year end exchange rates. Our revenue assumptions are subject to changes in economic and market conditions. We estimate that the total annual cost synergies associated with the Paxar integration to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million, with an estimated $60 million to $70 million of these cost synergies expected to represent incremental savings during 2008. To accomplish our synergy target, we will incur pretax cash costs estimated to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million. Approximately $75 million of these costs were incurred in 2007, and we estimate approximately $60 million to $70 million will be incurred in 2008. We anticipate continued benefit from our ongoing productivity improvement initiatives. In addition to the synergies resulting from the Paxar integration described above, we anticipate our restructuring and business realignment efforts to yield incremental savings in 2008 of an estimated $30 million, net of transition costs. We 19 Table of Contents assume the benefits from these and other productivity initiatives will be partially offset by approximately 2% inflation of raw material costs (approximately $50 million to $55 million) based on current commodity pricing trends, as well as higher costs associated with general inflation and investments for growth during 2008. We anticipate price increases in 2008 to at least partially offset raw material inflation. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, approximately $20 million to $30 million higher than 2007, driven by acquisition related debt. Our estimate is subject to changes in average debt outstanding and changes in market rates associated with the portion of our debt tied to variable interest rates. We anticipate total restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2008 to be lower than the charges taken in 2007. The annual effective tax rate will be impacted by future events including changes in tax laws, geographic income mix, tax audits, closure of tax years, legal entity restructuring, and the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate can potentially have wide variances from quarter to quarter, resulting from interim reporting requirements and the recognition of discrete events. We anticipate our capital and software expenditures before Paxar integration related activities to be approximately $195 million in 2008. Capital and software expenditures related to the Paxar integration are expected to total $40 million to $45 million, of which approximately $25 million to $30 million is expected to be incurred during 2008. These costs are included in the total one time cash cost estimate for the integration, discussed above. Reflecting the foregoing assumptions, we expect an increase in annual earnings and free cash flow in comparison with 2007. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 6,307.8 $ 5,575.9 $ 5,473.5 Cost of products sold 4,585.4 4,037.9 3,996.6 Gross profit 1,722.4 1,538.0 1,476.9 Marketing, general and administrative expense 1,182.5 1,011.1 987.9 Interest expense 105.2 55.5 57.9 Other expense, net 59.4 36.2 63.6 Income from continuing operations before taxes $ 375.3 $ 435.2 $ 367.5 As a Percent of Sales: % % % Gross profit (margin) 27.3 27.6 27.0 Marketing, general and administrative expense 18.7 18.1 18.0 Income from continuing operations before taxes 5.9 7.8 6.7 In 2006, we reclassified shipping and handling costs from Marketing, general and administrative expense to Cost of products sold to align our businesses around a standard accounting policy. Previous results included herein have been reclassified for comparability to the current year. Sales Sales increased 13% in 2007 compared to an increase of 2% in 2006. The benefit of the Paxar acquisition, net of product line divestitures, increased sales by an estimated $500 million in 2007. Product line divestitures, net of incremental sales from acquisitions, reduced sales by approximately $54 million in 2006. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately $232 million in 2007 compared to approximately $21 million in 2006. 20 Table of Contents Organic sales growth was approximately 1% in 2007 compared to approximately 3% in 2006. Organic sales growth in 2007 reflected growth in our Pressure sensitive Materials segment and other specialty converting businesses, driven by expansion of international markets. This international growth was partially offset by slower and more competitive market conditions in our North American roll materials business (where unit volume growth was more than offset by negative price and mix). The organic sales growth in Pressure sensitive Materials and other specialty converting businesses was offset by a decline in our Office and Consumer Products segment, due primarily to customer inventory reductions. Our Retail Information Services segment experienced organic sales growth of 1% in 2007, reflecting increased sales for the European retail market, partially offset by a decline in orders related to apparel shipped to North American retailers and brand owners. On an organic basis, sales in the U.S. were approximately even in 2006, compared to a decrease of approximately 3% in 2005. The North American roll materials business was impacted by slow market conditions and share loss resulting from price increases. The benefit from growth of Avery brand products and a strong back to school season in our Office and Consumer Products segment in the U.S. was offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin private label business (approximate impact of $22 million) in that segment. Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for further information on segments. Gross Profit Gross profit margin in 2007 decreased due to price competition and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business and higher raw material costs. The negative effect of these factors was partially offset by the addition of the higher gross profit margin Paxar business, as well as benefits from our ongoing productivity improvement and cost reduction actions. In 2006, the benefits of productivity improvement and cost reduction actions were partially offset by: Unfavorable segment mix (faster growth in segments with lower gross profit margin as a percent of sales) Energy related cost inflation Transition costs associated with restructuring Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expense in 2007 increased from 2006, as savings from restructuring actions and other cost reductions were more than offset by: Costs associated with the Paxar business and related integration expense (totaling approximately $185 million, including $40 million in integration related transition costs and $12 million in amortization of intangibles) The impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $30 million). Marketing, general and administrative expense in 2006 increased from 2005, as the benefits from productivity improvement initiatives and cost reduction actions were more than offset by: Recognition of stock option expense (approximately $21 million) Increased spending on information systems and marketing (approximately $19 million) Increase in pension, medical and other employee related costs (approximately $12 million) Interest Expense Interest expense increased 90%, or approximately $50 million, in 2007 compared to 2006, due to an increase in borrowings to fund the Paxar acquisition, as well as an increase in interest rates. 21 Table of Contents Other Expense, net (In millions, pretax) 2007 2006 2005 Restructuring costs $ 21.6 $ 21.1 $ 37.5 Asset impairment and lease cancellation charges 17.5 8.7 28.1 Asset impairment integration related 18.4 Other items 1.9 6.4 (2.0 ) Other expense, net $ 59.4 $ 36.2 $ 63.6 In 2007 and 2006, Other expense, net consisted of charges for restructuring, including severance and other employee related costs and asset impairment charges related to cost reduction actions and divestitures, as described above in the Cost Reduction Actions and Paxar Integration Actions sections herein. Refer also to Note 10, Cost Reduction Actions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The other items included in Other expense, net in 2007 included: Cash flow hedge loss ($4.8 million) Expenses related to a divestiture ($.3 million) Reversal of accrual related to a lawsuit ($3.2 million) The other items included in Other expense, net in 2006 included: Accrual for environmental remediation costs ($13 million); refer to the Environmental section of Financial Condition below Costs related to a lawsuit and a divestiture ($.8 million) Gain on sale of assets ($5.3 million) Gain on curtailment and settlement of a pension obligation ($1.6 million) Gain on sale of an investment ($10.5 million), partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Avery Dennison Foundation ($10 million) In 2005, other items included in Other expense, net consisted of a gain on the sale of assets ($5.8 million), partially offset by costs related to a lawsuit ($3.8 million). Net Income: (In millions, except per share amounts) 2007 2006 2005 Income from continuing operations before taxes $ 375.3 $ 435.2 $ 367.5 Taxes on income 71.8 76.7 75.3 Income from continuing operations 303.5 358.5 292.2 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 14.7 (65.4 ) Net income $ 303.5 $ 373.2 $ 226.8 Net income per common share $ 3.09 $ 3.74 $ 2.27 Net income per common share, assuming dilution $ 3.07 $ 3.72 $ 2.26 Net income as a percent of sales 4.8% 6.7% 4.1% Effective tax rate from continuing operations 19.1% 17.6% 20.5% Taxes on Income Both our 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates included the benefits from changes in the geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our global tax structure. 22 Table of Contents The effective tax rate in both years includes the impact from several tax audit settlements in various jurisdictions, reflecting a net expense of $.8 million in 2007 and a net benefit of $8.1 million in 2006. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations includes the divestiture of our raised reflective pavement markers business as noted in the Overview section above. The divestiture of this business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit ($14.9 million) due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business and a gain on sale of $1.3 million. Based on our estimated value of the raised reflective pavement markers business in 2005, we concluded that associated goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were impaired. The resulting pretax impairment charge was approximately $74 million in 2005. Income from discontinued operations included net sales of approximately $7 million in 2006, and $23 million in 2005. Refer to the Discontinued Operations section of Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Pressure sensitive Materials Segment (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales including intersegment sales $ 3,662.6 $ 3,397.8 $ 3,277.7 Less intersegment sales (164.9 ) (161.5 ) (163.2 ) Net sales $ 3,497.7 $ 3,236.3 $ 3,114.5 Operating income(1) 318.7 301.6 264.1 (1) Includes restructuring costs, asset impairment charges and other items for all years presented $ 13.8 $ 9.3 $ 23.0 Net Sales Sales in our Pressure sensitive Materials segment increased 8% in 2007 compared to 4% growth in 2006. Organic sales growth in both 2007 and 2006 was approximately 3%. Organic sales growth for 2007 and 2006 reflected growth in our roll materials and graphics and reflective businesses in Asia, Latin America and Europe, partially offset by declines in our North American roll materials businesses. For both years, market expansion in our roll materials business contributed to double digit organic sales growth in Asia and mid single digit organic sales growth in Latin America. In both 2007 and 2006, our roll materials business in Europe experienced low single digit organic sales growth. In our North American roll materials business, 2007 sales on an organic basis declined at a low single digit rate, while 2006 sales were even with the prior year. Slow market conditions impacted both years. In 2007, a more competitive environment due in part to capacity additions in the industry led to price reductions to maintain market share. In 2006, the loss of market share following our implementation of selling price increases in 2005 and early 2006 contributed to a decline in this business. Our graphics and reflective business experienced mid single digit organic sales growth in both 2007 and 2006, as strong international growth was partially offset by declines in the U.S. The changes in reported sales for this segment included a favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $174 million in 2007 and approximately $15 million in 2006. 23 Table of Contents Operating Income Increased operating income in 2007 and 2006 reflected higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. In 2007, these initiatives were partially offset by a more competitive pricing environment and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business, higher raw material costs and transition costs related to restructuring actions. In 2006, these initiatives were partially offset by stock option expense. Operating income for all three years reflected restructuring and asset impairment charges. In 2007, operating income included a reversal of a portion of an accrual related to a lawsuit. In 2006, operating income included a gain on sale of assets, legal fees related to a lawsuit, and lease cancellation charges. In 2005, operating income included an accrual related to a lawsuit, net of a gain on sale of assets. Retail Information Services Segment (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales including intersegment sales $ 1,176.6 $ 671.1 $ 637.1 Less intersegment sales (2.1 ) (3.4 ) (6.7 ) Net sales $ 1,174.5 $ 667.7 $ 630.4 Operating income(1)(2) (4.0 ) 45.7 37.7 (1) Includes restructuring costs, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges for all years presented $ 31.2 $ 11.2 $ 7.5 (2) Includes transition costs associated with Paxar integration $ 43.0 $ $ Net Sales Sales in our Retail Information Services segment increased 76% in 2007 compared to an increase of 6% in 2006. In 2007, the increase reflected an estimated $510 million in sales from the Paxar acquisition and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $17 million). In 2006, the increase reflected growth of the business in Asia, Latin America and Europe, incremental sales from acquisitions (approximately $3 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $3 million). Organic sales growth of approximately 1% in 2007 reflected increased sales for the European retail market, partially offset by a decline in orders related to apparel shipped to North American retailers and brand owners. Organic sales growth was 5% in 2006. Operating Income Operating loss in 2007 reflected transition costs and integration related asset impairment charges associated with the Paxar acquisition, amortization of acquisition intangibles and higher expenses due to investments for growth in Asia, including higher employee related costs. Higher operating costs were partially offset by higher sales and savings from restructuring and productivity initiatives. In 2006, operating income benefited from productivity improvement actions, including the migration of production from Hong Kong to lower cost facilities in mainland China. Benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by increased spending for information systems, stock option expense and other incremental employee related costs in 2006. Operating income included integration related software impairment charges in 2007. Restructuring costs, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges were incurred in all three years. 24 Table of Contents Office and Consumer Products Segment (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales including intersegment sales $ 1,017.8 $ 1,073.8 $ 1,138.1 Less intersegment sales (1.6 ) (1.8 ) (2.0 ) Net sales $ 1,016.2 $ 1,072.0 $ 1,136.1 Operating income(1) 173.6 187.4 161.9 (1) Includes restructuring costs for all years, asset impairment charges for 2005 and 2006, and other items for 2006 and 2007 $ 4.8 $ (2.3 ) $ 21.8 Net Sales Sales in our Office and Consumer Products segment decreased 5% in 2007 and 6% in 2006. The decline in reported sales in 2007 reflected lower sales on an organic basis, as well as the impact of product line divestitures (approximately $9 million). The decline in reported sales in 2006 reflected the impact of a product line divestiture in Europe (approximately $51 million). Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in reported sales of approximately $25 million in 2007 and $1 million in 2006. On an organic basis, sales declined approximately 7% in 2007. The decline reflected customer inventory reductions resulting in part from a volume shift to the fourth quarter of 2006 in advance of January 2007 selling price increases for certain product lines, the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin business, and a weaker back to school season compared to the prior year. In 2006, sales on an organic basis declined 1%, reflecting the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin private label business at the end of 2005 (approximately $22 million), partially offset by growth in Avery brand products, a strong back to school season in North America, and accelerated purchases by customers in late 2006 in advance of our 2007 selling price increases for certain product lines. Operating Income Operating income in 2007 reflected lower sales, restructuring charges and related transition costs, and higher raw material costs, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and productivity initiatives. Operating income in 2006 reflected cost savings from productivity improvement and restructuring actions, partially offset by associated transition costs, higher raw material and energy related costs, increased marketing costs and stock option expense. Operating income in 2007 included lease cancellation costs and expense related to a divestiture. In 2006, operating income included a gain from sale of assets, a gain from curtailment and settlement of a pension obligation, and a net gain from a product line divestiture. Asset impairment charges were incurred in both 2005 and 2006, while restructuring costs were incurred in all three years. Other specialty converting businesses (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales including intersegment sales $ 639.3 $ 614.3 $ 607.7 Less intersegment sales (19.9 ) (14.4 ) (15.2 ) Net sales $ 619.4 $ 599.9 $ 592.5 Operating income(1) 25.4 17.3 14.9 (1) Includes restructuring and asset impairment charges for all years presented $ 4.2 $ 3.7 $ 6.2 25 Table of Contents Net Sales Sales in our other specialty converting businesses increased 3% in 2007 and 1% in 2006. In 2007, the increase reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $16 million), partially offset by the impact of a product line divestiture, net of a small acquisition (approximately $2 million). In 2006, a product line divestiture reduced reported sales by approximately $7 million, while foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately $1 million. Organic sales growth of approximately 1% in 2007 included the negative effect of exiting certain low margin products in our specialty tape business (approximately $16 million). The loss of these sales was more than offset by solid growth in other parts of the specialty tape business, as well as growth of the RFID division. Organic sales growth of approximately 2% in 2006 reflected solid growth in our specialty tape business, partially offset by weakness in other businesses. Operating Income Operating income for these businesses increased in 2007, reflecting higher sales, savings from restructuring and productivity initiatives, and a reduction in operating loss from the RFID division. Operating income for these businesses increased in 2006, reflecting cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by stock option expense. Operating income for all years included restructuring and asset impairment charges.

In 2007, cash flow provided by operating activities was impacted by lower net income, changes in working capital and other factors, as shown below: Negative factors Accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected the timing of payments, as well as shorter vendor payment terms 26 Table of Contents Positive factors Other current assets primarily reflected the timing of collection of value added tax receivables in Europe Long term retirement benefits and other liabilities primarily reflected lower contributions to our pension plans, partially offset by benefit payments In 2006, cash flow provided by operating activities was impacted by higher net income, changes in working capital and other factors, as shown below: Negative factors Other current assets primarily reflected the timing of collection of value added tax receivables in Europe Inventories reflected increased purchases to support higher sales and customer service initiatives Long term retirement benefits and other liabilities reflected benefit payments, partially offset by contributions of approximately $39 million to our pension and postretirement health benefit plans Positive factors Accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected the timing of payments and increased inventory Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Purchase of property, plant and equipment $ (190.5 ) $ (161.9 ) $ (162.5 ) Purchase of software and other deferred charges (64.3 ) (33.4 ) (25.8 ) Payments for acquisitions (1,291.9 ) (13.4 ) (2.8 ) Proceeds from sale of assets 4.9 15.4 21.8 Proceeds from sale of businesses and investments 35.4 Other (1.4 ) 3.0 1.7 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,543.2 ) $ (154.9 ) $ (167.6 ) Payments for acquisitions On June 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Paxar. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement, each outstanding share of Paxar common stock, par value $0.10 was converted into the right to receive $30.50 in cash. The total purchase price for this transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, including transaction costs of approximately $15 million. Cash paid for acquisitions is reported net of cash acquired of approximately $47 million. Funds to complete the acquisition were initially derived from commercial paper borrowings, supported by a bridge revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Payments for acquisitions during 2007 also include buy outs of minority interest shareholders associated with certain subsidiaries of RVL Packaging, Inc. and Paxar of approximately $4 million. Capital Spending Significant capital projects in 2007 included investments for expansion in China and India serving both our materials and retail information services businesses. Significant information technology projects in 2007 included customer service and standardization initiatives. 27 Table of Contents Proceeds from Sale of Businesses and Investments In 2006, we sold a long term investment (proceeds of approximately $16 million), divested our raised reflective pavement marker business in the U.S. (proceeds of approximately $9 million), and divested a product line in Europe (proceeds of approximately $4 million). Cash Flow Used in Financing Activities: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net change in borrowings and payments of debt $ 1,259.0 $ (140.1 ) $ (80.5 ) Dividends paid (171.8 ) (171.8 ) (168.7 ) Purchase of treasury stock (63.2 ) (157.7 ) (40.9 ) Proceeds from exercise of stock options, net 38.1 54.1 11.1 Other (6.7 ) 17.7 18.5 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 1,055.4 $ (397.8 ) $ (260.5 ) Borrowings and Repayment of Debt At year end 2007, our borrowings outstanding under foreign short term lines of credit were $70.1 million (weighted average interest rate of 10.6%), compared to $101.5 million at year end 2006 (weighted average interest rate of 9.6%). Short term variable rate commercial paper borrowings were $990.2 million at December 29, 2007 (weighted average interest rate of 5.2%) compared to $154.4 million at December 30, 2006 (weighted average interest rate of 5.0%). During 2007, we increased our short term borrowings to initially fund the Paxar acquisition, as noted above in Payments for acquisitions, as well as to support share repurchases. The change in outstanding commercial paper also reflects positive cash flow from operations. We had medium term notes of $100 million outstanding at year end 2007, compared to $160 million at year end 2006. In 2007, medium term notes of $60 million were paid on maturity. Outstanding medium term notes have maturities from 2008 through 2025 and accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.9% to 7.6%. In September 2007, one of our subsidiaries issued $250 million 10 year senior notes, which we guaranteed, bearing interest at a rate of 6.625% per year, due October 2017. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $247 million and were used to pay down current long term debt maturities of $150 million and reduce commercial paper borrowings of $97 million initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. In November 2007, we issued $400 million of 7.875% Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt issue. An additional $40 million of HiMEDS units were issued in December 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment allocation from the initial issuance. Each HiMEDS unit is comprised of two components a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million to approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the stock price at that time) and a senior note due in 2020. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $427 million, which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. Shareholders Equity Our shareholders equity was approximately $1.99 billion at year end 2007, compared to approximately $1.70 billion at year end 2006. Our annual dividend per share increased to $1.61 in 2007 from $1.57 in 2006. Share Repurchases On October 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase an additional 5 million shares of the Companys stock under our existing stock repurchase program, resulting in a total authorization of approximately 7.4 million shares of the Companys stock at that date. We repurchased approximately .8 million and 2.5 million shares in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash payments for these repurchased shares were approximately 28 Table of Contents $63 million and approximately $158 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the 2007 cash payments were approximately $11 million related to shares repurchased in 2006, but settled in 2007. As of December 29, 2007, approximately 4.1 million shares were available for repurchase under the Board of Directors authorization. In 2005, we repurchased approximately .7 million shares under an agreement related to the LE Packaging (LE) acquisition and recorded such amount to treasury stock. Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts Long lived Assets Goodwill increased $967 million during 2007, primarily due to our preliminary valuation of goodwill associated with the Paxar acquisition completed in June 2007 ($931 million), buy outs of minority interest shareholders ($4 million) associated with certain subsidiaries of RVL Packaging, Inc. and Paxar, and foreign currency translation ($32 million), partially offset by a tax adjustment related to a previous acquisition (less than $1 million). Other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions increased approximately $219 million during 2007 due to our preliminary valuation of the intangible assets of the Paxar acquisition ($234 million), and the impact of foreign currency translation ($5 million), partially offset by amortization expense ($20 million). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Other assets increased approximately $63 million during 2007 due primarily to purchases of software and other deferred charges ($64 million), an increase in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance ($17 million), debt issuance costs associated with current year issuances ($15 million), increase in long term pension assets ($7 million), increase in other assets ($3 million), and the impact of foreign currency translation ($6 million), partially offset by normal amortization of software and other deferred charges ($31 million), and software asset impairments ($18 million). Other Shareholders Equity Accounts The value of our employee stock benefit trust decreased $174 million in 2007, due to a decrease in the market value of shares held in the trust of approximately $120 million, and the issuance of shares under our stock option and incentive plans of approximately $54 million. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) changed by approximately $135 million due to foreign currency translation (approximately $106 million), as well as the current year amortization and recognition of net pension transition obligation, prior service cost and net actuarial loss (approximately $29 million). Impact of Foreign Currency Translation: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Change in net sales $ 232 $ 21 $ 77 Change in net income 13 2 2 In 2007, international operations generated approximately 63% of our net sales. Our future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates. The benefit to sales from currency translation in 2007 primarily reflected a benefit from sales denominated in Euros, as well as sales in the currencies of Great Britain, Australia, Brazil and China, partially offset by a negative impact of sales in the currencies of South Africa and Hong Kong. Translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies are included in net income in the period incurred. Operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years. In 2007, we had no operations in hyperinflationary economies. In 2006, the only hyperinflationary economy in which we operated was the Dominican Republic, which uses the U.S. dollar as the 29 Table of Contents functional currency. In 2005, our operations in hyperinflationary economies consisted of the Dominican Republic and Turkey; however, the impact on net income from these operations was not significant. Effect of Foreign Currency Transactions The impact on net income from transactions denominated in foreign currencies is mitigated because the costs of our products are generally denominated in the same currencies in which they are sold. In addition, to reduce our income statement exposure to transactions in foreign currencies, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts, where available and appropriate. Analysis of Selected Financial Ratios We utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance, as discussed below. Operational Working Capital Ratio Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities, excluding working capital of held for sale businesses) as a percent of net sales decreased in 2007 primarily due to an increase in short term debt. On February 8, 2008, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement for a term loan credit facility with fourteen domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of $400 million, maturing February 8, 2011. The proceeds from this term loan credit facility were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings (included in current liabilities) initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. Operational working capital from continuing operations, as a percent of net sales, is a non GAAP measure and is shown below. We use this non GAAP measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing and other activities (that affect cash and cash equivalents, deferred taxes, other current assets and other current liabilities) that tend to be disparate in amount and timing and therefore, may increase the volatility of the working capital ratio from period to period. Additionally, the items excluded from this measure are not necessarily indicative of the underlying trends of our operations and are not significantly influenced by the day to day activities that are managed at the operating level. Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures. Our objective is to minimize our investment in operational working capital, as a percentage of sales, by reducing this ratio, to maximize cash flow and return on investment. Operational working capital from continuing operations: (In millions) 2007 2006 (A) Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities; excludes working capital of held for sale businesses) $ (419.3 ) $ (12.1 ) Reconciling items: Cash and cash equivalents (71.5 ) (58.5 ) Deferred taxes and other current assets (242.0 ) (221.1 ) Short term and current portion of long term debt 1,110.8 466.4 Other current liabilities 687.6 602.3 (B) Operational working capital from continuing operations $ 1,065.6 $ 777.0 (C) Net sales $ 6,307.8 $ 5,575.9 Working capital, as a percent of net sales(A)(C) (6.6 )% (.2 )% Operational working capital from continuing operations, as a percent of net sales(B)(C) 16.9 % 13.9 % 30 Table of Contents As a percent of sales, operational working capital from continuing operations in 2007 increased compared to 2006. The primary factors contributing to this change, which includes the impact of currency translation, are discussed below. Accounts Receivable Ratio The average number of days sales outstanding was 62 days in 2007 compared to 58 days in 2006, calculated using a four quarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the average daily sales for the year. The change is primarily due to the acquisition of Paxar, as well as the timing of sales and collections. Inventory Ratio Average inventory turnover was 7.8 in 2007 compared to 8.1 in 2006, calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a four quarter average inventory balance. The change is primarily due to the acquisition of Paxar. Accounts Payable Ratio The average number of days payable outstanding was 58 days in 2007 compared to 61 days in 2006, calculated using a four quarter average accounts payable balance divided by the average daily cost of products sold for the year. The change is primarily due to the timing of payments in Europe, partially offset by the acquisition of Paxar. Debt Ratios Year End Requirement 2007 2006 Total debt to total capital 53.1 % 36.3 % Debt covenant ratios: Total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Not to exceed 3.5:1.0 3.2:1.0 1.4:1.0 Earnings before interest and taxes to interest At least 3.5:1.0 4.6:1.0 9.3:1.0 The increase in the total debt to total capital ratio in 2007 was primarily due to a net increase in debt related to the Paxar acquisition and share repurchases, partially offset by an increase in shareholders equity. Our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of income. We were in compliance with these covenants as shown in the table above. The fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. At year end, the fair value of our total debt, including short term borrowings, was $2,250.7 million in 2007 and $963 million in 2006. Shareholders Equity Ratios 2007 2006 2005 Return on average shareholders equity 16.5 % 22.7 % 14.5 % Return on average total capital 10.6 15.7 10.0 Decreases in these ratios in 2007 compared to 2006 were primarily due to lower net income, as well as higher equity and total debt outstanding. These ratios are computed using actual net income and a five quarter average denominator for equity and total debt accounts. Capital Resources Capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt financing. We maintain adequate financing arrangements at competitive rates. These financing arrangements consist of our commercial paper programs in the 31 Table of Contents U.S. and Europe, committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we operate, callable commercial notes, and long term debt, including medium term notes. Capital from Debt Our total debt increased approximately $1.29 billion in 2007 to $2.26 billion compared to year end 2006, reflecting increased short term borrowings primarily related to the Paxar acquisition during the second quarter of 2007 and share repurchases. We initially funded the Paxar acquisition by issuing commercial paper, supported by a bridge revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) we entered into in June 2007 with five domestic and foreign banks. The Credit Facility had an initial total commitment of $1.35 billion, expiring June 11, 2008, for terms which are generally similar to existing credit facilities. Financing available under this agreement is permitted to be used for working capital, commercial paper back up and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. As of December 29, 2007, the outstanding commitment was $715 million. In August 2007, we amended our existing revolving credit agreement, increasing commitments from $525 million to $1 billion and extending the maturity to August 2012. Commitments were provided by twelve domestic and foreign banks. Financing available under the agreement will be used as a commercial paper back up facility and is also available to finance other corporate requirements, including acquisitions. In September 2007, one of our subsidiaries issued $250 million 10 year senior notes, which we guaranteed, bearing interest at a rate of 6.625% per year, due October 2017. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $247 million and were used to pay down current long term debt maturities of $150 million and reduce commercial paper borrowings of $97 million initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. The Credit Facility and the revolving credit agreement are subject to customary financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, with which we are in compliance. In November 2007, we issued $400 million of 7.875% Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt issue. An additional $40 million of HiMEDS units were issued in December 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment allocation from the initial issuance. Each HiMEDS unit is comprised of two components a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million to approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the stock price at that time) and a senior note due in 2020. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $427 million, which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. In addition, we have a 364 day revolving credit facility in which a foreign bank provides us up to Euro 40 million ($57.5 million) in borrowings through July 31, 2008. With the approval of the bank, we may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis. Financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements of our European operations. There was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of December 29, 2007 and $26.3 million outstanding as of December 30, 2006. We had standby letters of credit outstanding of $80.9 million (including $7.3 million of standby letters of credit we assumed from Paxar) and $77.1 million at the end of 2007 and 2006, respectively. The aggregate contract amount of outstanding standby letters of credit approximated fair value. In connection with the Paxar acquisition, we have assumed additional debt of approximately $5 million, which remains outstanding at December 29, 2007. Our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately $448.2 million at year end 2007. Our uncommitted lines of credit do not have a commitment expiration date and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to permit the issuance of debt and equity securities. Proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing debt, and for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. This shelf registration replaced the shelf registration statement filed in 2004. The HiMEDS units discussed above were issued under this registration statement. 32 Table of Contents As discussed above, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement on February 8, 2008 for a term loan credit facility with fourteen domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of $400 million, maturing February 8, 2011. The proceeds from this term loan credit facility were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short term and long term financing. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings. When determining a credit rating, the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position, business outlook, consistency of cash flows, debt level and liquidity, geographic dispersion and management team. Our credit ratings as of year end 2007: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Standard Poors Rating Service (SP) A 2 BBB+ Watch Negative Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) P2 Baa1 Under Review (1) Refer to Note 14, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. As of December 29, 2007, our ratings were under review due to the recent acquisition of Paxar. SP and Moodys lowered our long term rating from A to BBB+, and A3 to Baa1, respectively, due to the incremental debt incurred as a result of the Paxar acquisition. We remain committed to retaining a solid investment grade rating.

We enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation. The terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations, except for the facility in Mentor, Ohio as noted below. The table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms of one year or more. On September 9, 2005, we completed the lease financing for a commercial facility (the Facility) located in Mentor, Ohio, used primarily for the new headquarters and research center for our roll materials group. The Facility consists generally of land, buildings, equipment and office furnishings. We have leased the Facility under an operating lease arrangement, which contains a residual value guarantee of $33.4 million. We do not expect the residual value of the Facility to be less than the amount guaranteed. We did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end 2007 in the table of contractual obligations above, because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems. 33 Table of Contents The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $125 million, the timing of which is uncertain, except for approximately $7 million that may become payable during 2008. Refer to Note 11, Taxes Based on Income to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on unrecognized tax benefits. Investigations and Legal Proceedings We previously announced that we had been notified by the European Commission, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the Competition Law Department of the Department of Justice of Canada and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of their respective criminal investigations into competitive practices in the label stock industry. We cooperated with all of these investigations, and all, except the Australian investigation which is continuing, have been terminated without further action by the authorities. We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation. We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These and other matters are reported in Note 8, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental We have been designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and or other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at eighteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites, including Paxar sites, which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and or groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon. We are participating with other PRPs at such sites, and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the EPA or other governmental authorities. We have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a PRP, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued. As of December 29, 2007, our estimated liability associated with compliance and remediation costs was approximately $38 million, including preliminary liabilities related to the acquisition of Paxar. See also Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2006, we recognized $15 million for estimated environmental remediation costs for a former operating facility. Of the amount accrued, which represented the lower end of the current estimated range of $15 million to $17 million for costs expected to be incurred, approximately $9 million remained accrued as of December 29, 2007. We considered additional information provided by outside consultants in revising our previous estimates of expected costs. This estimate could change depending on various factors, such as modification of currently planned remedial actions, changes in site conditions, a change in the estimated time to complete remediation, changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors. Other amounts currently accrued are not significant to our consolidated financial position, and based upon current information, we believe that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other In 2005, we contacted relevant authorities in the U.S. and reported on the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our reflective business in China, and involved, among other things, impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments. The payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration. Corrective and disciplinary 34 Table of Contents actions have been taken. Sales of our reflective business in China in 2005 were approximately $7 million. Based on findings to date, no changes to our previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters. However, we believe that fines or other penalties could be incurred. While we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, we believe that our behavior in detecting, investigating, responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably. We and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our business. Based upon current information, we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us. We provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized. These costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units, cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage. As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary. We participate in international receivable financing programs with several financial institutions whereby advances may be requested from these financial institutions. Such advances are guaranteed by us. At December 29, 2007, we had guaranteed approximately $17 million. As of December 29, 2007, we guaranteed up to approximately $22 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries obligations to their suppliers, as well as approximately $476 million of certain of our subsidiaries lines of credit with various financial institutions. In November 2007, we issued $400 million of 7.875% Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt issue. An additional $40 million of HiMEDS units were issued in December 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment allocation from the initial issuance. Each HiMEDS unit is comprised of two components a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million to approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the stock price at that time) and a senior note due in 2020. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $427 million, which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. USES AND LIMITATIONS OF NON GAAP MEASURES We use certain non GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative (e.g. gains on sales of assets, restructuring charges, asset impairments, etc.), from certain of our GAAP measures, management believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Companys core or underlying operating results. These non GAAP measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. Limitations associated with the use of our non GAAP measures include (1) the exclusion of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the calculation of organic sales growth; (2) the exclusion of mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchase, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash flow; and (3) the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents, short term debt, deferred taxes, and other current assets and other current liabilities, as well as current assets and current liabilities of held for sale businesses, for the calculation of operational working capital. While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that supplemental non GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Companys performance and operating trends. 35 Table of Contents RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS From time to time, we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties. We believe that such transactions are at arms length and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. One of our directors, Peter W. Mullin is the chairman, chief executive officer and a director of MC Insurance Services, Inc. (MC), Mullin Insurance Services, Inc. (MINC), and PWM Insurance Services, Inc. (PWM), executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents. Mr. Mullin is also the majority stockholder of MC, MINC and PWM (collectively referred to as the Mullin Companies). We paid premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the Mullin Companies in connection with various of our employee benefit plans. The Mullin Companies have advised us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and renewal of this insurance. Approximately 50% of these commissions were allocated to and used by MullinTBG Insurance Agency Services, LLC (an affiliate of MC) to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants under various of our employee benefit plans. The Mullin Companies own a minority interest in M Financial Holdings, Inc. (MFH). Substantially all of the life insurance policies, which we placed through the Mullin Companies in 2007 and prior years, are issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and M Life Insurance Company (M Life), a wholly owned subsidiary of MFH. Reinsurance returns earned by M Life are determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or positive, depending upon the results of M Lifes aggregate reinsurance pool, which consists of the insured lives reinsured by M Life. The Mullin Companies have advised us that they participated in net reinsurance gains of M Life. In addition, the Mullin Companies have advised us that they also participated in net reinsurance gains of M Life that are subject to risk of forfeiture. None of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations.

These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and which require us to make difficult, subjective and or complex judgments. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. We believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, accounts receivable allowances, inventory and inventory reserves, long lived asset impairments, pensions and postretirement benefits, income taxes, stock based compensation, restructuring and severance costs, litigation and environmental, and business combinations. 36 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, pricing is determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Furthermore, sales, provisions for estimated returns, and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks and rewards of ownership. Sales terms are generally f.o.b. (free on board) shipping point or f.o.b. destination, depending upon local business customs. For most regions in which we operate, f.o.b. shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded at the time of shipment, because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred. In certain regions, notably in Europe, f.o.b. destination terms are generally utilized and sales are recorded when the products are delivered to the customers delivery site, because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred. Actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances. Sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate. Volume, promotional, price, cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales. Rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold. These estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products. We review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available. Sales Returns and Allowances Sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our customers (both affiliated and non affiliated) for the return of unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of return. We accrue for returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the products sold and historical experience for such products. We record these allowances based on the following factors: (i) customer specific allowances; and (ii) an estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues not yet identified. Accounts Receivable Allowances We are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy, historical experience and future expectations. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value. We record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors: (i) customer specific allowances; (ii) amounts based upon an aging schedule; and (iii) an estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues not yet identified. No single customer represented 10% or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2007 and 2006. However, our ten largest customers at year end 2007 represented approximately 17% of trade accounts receivable and consisted of six customers of our Office and Consumer Products segment, three customers of our Pressure sensitive Materials segment and one customer of both these segments. The financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis. Inventory and Inventory Reserves Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials, work in progress or finished goods. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, we changed the method of accounting for inventories for our U.S. operations from a combination of the use of FIFO and LIFO methods to the FIFO method. The inventories for our international operations continue to be valued using the FIFO method. We believe this change is preferable as the FIFO method better reflects the current value of inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; provides better matching of revenue and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income; provides uniformity across our operations with respect to the method for inventory accounting; and enhances comparability with peers. Furthermore, this application of the FIFO method will be consistent with our accounting of inventories for U.S. income tax purposes. The change in accounting method from LIFO to FIFO method was completed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. We applied this change in accounting principle by retrospectively restating prior years financial statements. Refer to the Financial 37 Table of Contents Presentation and Inventories sections of Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Inventory reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess and slow moving inventory. We use estimates to record these reserves. Slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory. Long lived Asset Impairments We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of long lived assets are determined not to be recoverable. Impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value. Fair value is typically determined using quoted market prices, if available, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The key estimates applied when preparing cash flow projections relate to revenues, gross margins, economic life of assets, overheads, taxation and discount rates. The amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our long lived assets. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits In December 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R): a) Recognition of the funded status of the Companys defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan (with a corresponding reversal of minimum pension liability under SFAS No. 87); b) Recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations remaining from the initial application of SFAS Nos. 87 and 106 as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax; c) Measurement of the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the Companys fiscal year end; and d) Disclosure of additional information about the effects of the amortization of gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations (remaining from the initial application of SFAS Nos. 87 and 106) on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year. Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care costs, future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost. Discount Rate We, in consultation with our actuaries, annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. In the U.S., our discount rate is determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans. Long term Return on Assets We determine the long term rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets, taking into consideration that assets with higher volatility 38 Table of Contents typically generate a greater return over the long run. Additionally, current market conditions, such as interest rates, are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. Healthcare Cost Trend Rate Our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a cash basis. For measurement purposes, an 8% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2008. This rate is expected to decrease to approximately 5% by 2011. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Pursuant to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, when establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future sources of taxable income such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. SFAS No. 109 defines a tax planning strategy as an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets. In the event we determine the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. We have also acquired certain net deferred tax assets with existing valuation allowances. If it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, we will release the valuation allowance to current earnings or adjust the purchase price allocation, consistent with the manner of origination. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to managements assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time, pursuant to Financial Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 requires a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to FIN 48 and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we began recognizing expense for stock based compensation to comply with the provisions of the reissued SFAS No. 123(R), using the modified prospective application transition method. As permitted by this transition method, results for the prior periods have not been restated. In addition, we continued to recognize compensation cost related to outstanding unvested awards as of December 31, 2005 under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123. Stock based compensation expense for all awards granted after December 31, 2005 was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Valuation of Stock Options Our stock based compensation expense is the estimated fair value of options granted, amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of each of our stock option awards is estimated on the date 39 Table of Contents of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. This model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and the expected life of the options. Expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend divided by the 12 month average of our monthly stock price prior to grant. Expected volatility for options granted during 2007 represented an average of implied and historical volatility. Expected volatility for options granted prior to 2006 was based on historical volatility of our stock price. Risk free rate was based on the average of the 52 week average of the Treasury Bond rate that has a term corresponding to the expected option term. Expected term was determined based on historical experience under our stock option plans. Forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical data of our stock option forfeitures over the last twelve years prior to 2007. Certain of the assumptions used above are based on managements estimates. As such, if factors change and such factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates, our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different in the future. We have not capitalized costs associated with stock based compensation. Accounting for Income Taxes for Stock based Compensation We elected to use the short cut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee stock based compensation awards. In addition, we elected to follow the tax ordering laws to determine the sequence in which deductions and net operating loss carryforwards are utilized, as well as the direct only approach to calculating the amount of windfall or shortfall tax benefits. Restructuring and Severance Costs We account for restructuring costs including severance and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the guidance provided in SFAS No. 112, Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, and SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. In the U.S., we have a severance pay plan (Pay Plan), which provides eligible employees with severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination due to qualifying cost reduction actions. We calculate severance pay using the severance benefit formula under the Pay Plan. Accordingly, we record provisions for such amounts and other related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set forth under SFAS No. 112. In the absence of a Pay Plan or established local practices for overseas jurisdictions, liability for severance and other employee related costs is recognized when the liability is incurred, following the guidance of SFAS No. 146. Litigation and Environmental We are currently involved in various lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated, the best estimate within the range, or if an amount cannot be determined and be the most likely, the low end of the range is accrued. The ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results of operations should our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued. Environmental expenditures are generally expensed. However, environmental expenditures for newly acquired assets and those which extend or improve the economic useful life of existing assets are capitalized and amortized over the remaining asset life. We review each reporting period our estimates of costs of compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of various sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us a potentially responsible party. When it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated, the best estimate within the range, or if 40 Table of Contents an amount cannot be determined and be the most likely, the low end of the range is accrued. Potential insurance reimbursements are not offset against potential liabilities, and such liabilities are not discounted. Business Combinations We account for business combinations using the accounting requirements of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquired businesses at fair value, and we make estimates and assumptions to determine such fair values. We engage third party valuation specialists to assist us in determining these fair value estimates. We utilize a variety of assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable in determining fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future cash flows, growth rates, current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain assets, market rate assumptions for certain obligations and certain potential costs of compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of acquired properties. We also utilize information obtained from management of the acquired businesses and our own historical experience from previous acquisitions. We apply significant assumptions and estimates in determining certain intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions (such as customer relationships, patents and other acquired technology, and trademarks and trade names and related applicable useful lives), property, plant and equipment, receivables, inventories, investments, tax accounts, environmental liabilities, stock option awards, lease commitments and restructuring and integration costs. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. As such, decreases to fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including cost estimates for certain obligations and liabilities) are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period (generally within one year of the acquisition date) and as operating expenses thereafter. RECENT ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS During 2007, we adopted certain accounting and financial disclosure requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) and Financial Interpretations by the staff of the FASB. In 2006, the requirements with the most significant impact were the reissued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT The matters discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain estimates, assumptions, projections and or expectations regarding future events, which may or may not occur. Words such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, guidance, intend, may, objective, plan, potential, project, seek, shall, should, target, will, would, or variations thereof and other expressions, which refer to future events and trends, identify forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements, and financial or other business targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results, performance or achievements of the Company expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 29, 2007, and include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new production facilities; fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions, including synergies from the integration of the Paxar business in the time and the cost anticipated; ability of the Company to generate sustained productivity improvement; successful integration of acquisitions; successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment; the financial 41 Table of Contents condition and inventory strategies of customers; customer and supplier concentrations; changes in customer order patterns; loss of significant contract(s) or customer(s); timely development and market acceptance of new products; impact of competitive products and pricing; selling prices; business mix shift; credit risks; ability of the Company to obtain adequate financing arrangements; fluctuation of interest rates; fluctuation in pension, insurance and employee benefit costs; impact of legal proceedings, including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigation into industry competitive practices, and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to this investigation or to the subject matter thereof or of the concluded investigations by the DOJ, the EC, and the Canadian Department of Justice (including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation), as well as the impact of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act based on issues in China; changes in governmental regulations; changes in political conditions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations; worldwide and local economic conditions; impact of epidemiological events on the economy and the Companys customers and suppliers; acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters; and other factors. The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial expectations in the near term include (1) the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for the Companys products; (2) the degree to which higher raw material and energy related costs can be passed on to customers through selling price increases, without a significant loss of volume; (3) the impact of competitors actions, including pricing, expansion in key markets, and product offerings; (4) potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and or investigations regarding competitive activities, including possible fines, penalties, judgments or settlements; and (5) the ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions, including expected synergies associated with the Paxar acquisition. The Companys forward looking statements represent judgment only on the dates such statements were made. By making such forward looking statements, the Company assumes no duty to update them to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or circumstances, other than as may be required by law. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency, interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes. Our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income. Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings. In June 2007 and August 2007, we entered into certain interest rate option contracts to hedge our exposure related to interest rate increases in connection with our anticipated long term debt issuances. Such debt issuances were intended to replace the short term borrowings initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition and to support the refinancing of our current long term debt maturities. In connection with these transactions, we paid $11.5 million as option premiums, of which $4.8 million was recognized during the year as a cash flow hedge loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income and $6.7 million is being amortized over the life of the related forecasted hedged transactions. Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations. These amounts are not material to our financial statements. 42 Table of Contents In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions, other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price risk and litigation risk, which are not represented in the analyses that follow. Foreign Exchange Value At Risk We use a Value At Risk (VAR) model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts. This approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions. Firm commitments, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were included in the model. Forecasted transactions, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency. The volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on two year historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks. A 95% confidence level was used for a one day time horizon. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately $.3 million at year end 2007. Interest Rate Sensitivity An assumed 50 basis point move in interest rates (10% of our weighted average interest rate on floating rate debt) affecting our variable rate borrowings would have had an estimated $5 million effect on our 2007 earnings.
