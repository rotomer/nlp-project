Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative concerning our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: Definition of Terms 17 Overview and Outlook 18 Analysis of Results of Operations 22 Results of Operations by Segment 25 Financial Condition 28 Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures 37 Related Party Transactions 37 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 38 Recent Accounting Requirements 43 Safe Harbor Statement 43 DEFINITION OF TERMS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Our discussion of financial results includes several non GAAP measures to provide additional information concerning Avery Dennison Corporations (the Companys) performance. These non GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement our presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures. We use the following terms: Organic sales growth (decline) refers to the change in sales excluding the estimated impact of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures; Segment operating income (loss) refers to income before interest and taxes; Free cash flow refers to cash flow from operations and net proceeds from sale of investments, less payments for property, plant and equipment, software and other deferred charges; and Operational working capital refers to trade accounts receivable and inventories, net of accounts payable. As a result of the sale of our raised reflective pavement marker business during 2006 (discussed below in Divestitures), the discussions which follow reflect our restated results for the accounting change, as well as summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted. However, the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations. 17 Table of Contents OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Overview Sales Our sales from continuing operations increased 6% in 2008 compared to growth of 13% in 2007, driven primarily by the acquisitions of Paxar Corporation (Paxar) and DM Label Group (DM Label) and the effect of currency translation. Estimated change in sales due to: 2008 2007 2006 Organic sales growth (decline) (3 )% 1 % 3 % Foreign currency translation 3 5 Acquisitions, net of divestitures 7 8 (1 ) Reported sales growth(1) 6 % 13 % 2 % (1) Totals may not sum due to rounding On an organic basis, the decline of 3% in 2008 reflected worsening global economic conditions in 2008, which were experienced first in the U.S., then Western Europe, then in our emerging markets (Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America). Organic sales growth of 1% in 2007 reflected international growth, partially offset by slower and more competitive market conditions in North America. Net Income Net income decreased $37 million, or 12%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Negative factors affecting the change in net income included: Reduced fixed cost leverage due to sales decline on an organic basis Cost inflation, including raw material and energy costs Incremental interest expense and amortization of intangibles related to the Paxar and DM Label acquisitions The carryover effect of a more competitive pricing environment in the roll materials business in the prior year, partially offset by current year price increases Positive factors affecting the change in net income included: Cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives, including savings from restructuring actions Benefits from foreign currency translation and acquisitions Lower effective tax rate Lower asset impairment and restructuring charges related to cost reduction actions Lower transition costs related to the integration of Paxar Acquisitions We completed the Paxar acquisition on June 15, 2007. The combination of the Paxar business into our Retail Information Services segment increases our presence in the retail information and brand identification market, combines complementary strengths and broadens the range of our product and service capabilities, improves our ability to meet customer demands for product innovation and improved quality of service, and facilitates expansion into new product and geographic segments. See Paxar Acquisition related Actions below for information on cash costs incurred and cost synergies achieved during integration. We completed the DM Label acquisition on April 1, 2008. DM Label operations are included in our Retail Information Services segment. 18 Table of Contents See Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Paxar Acquisition related Actions The following integration actions resulted in headcount reductions of approximately 1,695 positions in our Retail Information Services segment: Paxar Acquisition Headcount (Dollars in millions) related costs(1) Reduction 2007 Restructuring(2) $ 31.2 200 2007 Transition costs(2) 43.0 2008 Restructuring(2) 5.6 130 2008 Transition costs(2) 19.9 2007 Purchase price adjustments 20.5 855 2008 Purchase price adjustments 6.0 510 Total Paxar integration actions $ 126.2 1,695 Change in control costs (purchase price adjustment) 27.8 Total Paxar acquisition related costs $ 154.0 (1) Includes severance, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges, where applicable (2) Recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income At year end, the Paxar integration was essentially complete. Cost synergies resulting from the integration were approximately $20 million in 2007 and an incremental $88 million in 2008. We expect to realize incremental savings of approximately $12 million in 2009. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Cost Reduction Actions Q4 2008 2009 Actions In response to worsening market conditions, we are undertaking new restructuring actions that began in the fourth quarter of 2008 that are expected to impact approximately 10% of the Companys global workforce. Refer to the Outlook section for total estimated costs to be incurred and annualized savings expected to be achieved through these actions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded $12.3 million in pretax charges related to these restructuring actions, consisting of severance and related employee costs, asset impairment charges, and lease cancellation costs. Severance and employee related costs related to approximately 700 positions, impacting all of our segments and geographic regions. We expect to realize savings of approximately $18 million in 2009 related to these charges. Q1 2008 Q3 2008 Actions During the first three quarters of 2008, we implemented cost reduction actions resulting in pretax charges of $22.8 million, including severance and employee related costs for approximately 645 positions, asset impairment charges, and lease cancellation costs. We expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately $20 million (most of which will benefit 2009) as a result of these restructuring actions. Q4 2006 2007 Actions We incurred $31.4 million in pretax charges related to cost reduction actions initiated from late 2006 through the end of 2007, including severance and employee related costs for approximately 555 positions, asset impairment charges, and lease cancellation costs. Savings from these restructuring actions, net of transition costs, were 19 Table of Contents approximately $5 million in 2008 and $32 million in 2007. We expect to realize incremental savings of $8 million in 2009. Q4 2005 Q3 2006 Actions During 2007 and 2006, we realized annualized pretax savings (net of transition costs) of over $90 million, resulting from restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005. These restructuring actions resulted in headcount reductions of approximately 1,150 positions, which impacted all of our segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006. Refer to Note 10, Cost Reduction Actions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Divestitures The divestiture of our raised reflective pavement marker business, which had sales of approximately $23 million in 2005, was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business. The results of this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations in 2006. This business was previously included in the Pressure sensitive Materials segment. In addition, the divestitures of two product lines were completed in the first quarter of 2006. The first product line, which was included in the Office and Consumer Products segment, had estimated sales of $60 million in 2005, with minimal impact to income from operations. The second product line, which was included in other specialty converting businesses, had annual sales of approximately $10 million in 2005, with minimal impact to income from operations. Free Cash Flow We use free cash flow as a measure of funds available for other corporate purposes, such as dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions, and repurchases of common stock. Management believes that this measure provides meaningful supplemental information to our investors to assist them in their financial analysis of the Company. Management believes that it is appropriate to measure cash flow (including net proceeds from sale of investments) after spending on property, plant, equipment, software and other deferred charges because such spending is considered integral to maintaining or expanding our underlying business. This measure is not intended to represent the residual cash available for discretionary purposes. Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures for further information regarding limitations of this measure. (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 539.7 $ 499.4 $ 510.8 Purchase of property, plant and equipment (128.5 ) (190.5 ) (161.9 ) Purchase of software and other deferred charges (63.1 ) (64.3 ) (33.4 ) Proceeds from sale of investments, net(1) 17.2 16.3 Free cash flow $ 365.3 $ 244.6 $ 331.8 (1) Net proceeds from sale of investments are related to the sale of securities held by our captive insurance company and other investments in 2008 and a sale of a long term investment in 2006. The increase in free cash flow in 2008 of $121 million is primarily due to increased cash flow provided by operating activities and reduced capital spending, partially offset by lower net income compared to 2007. The decrease in free cash flow in 2007 of $87 million reflects higher spending on property, plant and equipment and software and other deferred charges, as well as lower net income compared to 2006. See Analysis of Results of Operations and Liquidity in Financial Condition below for more information. 20 Table of Contents Legal Proceedings We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices. As previously disclosed, we have discovered instances of conduct by certain employees that potentially violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We reported that conduct to authorities in the U.S. and we believe it is possible that fines or other penalties could be incurred. The Board of Directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of certain independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters. We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These and other matters are reported in Note 8, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Outlook Certain statements contained in this section are forward looking statements and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Refer to our Safe Harbor Statement herein. In light of the global economic environment, we are not providing a 2009 earnings forecast at this time. If current exchange rate trends continue, they would have an unfavorable effect on earnings in 2009. We expect incremental pension and other employee related expenses and contributions in 2009. In response to increased uncertainty resulting from worsening global economic conditions, we initiated new cost reduction actions that target approximately $150 million in annualized savings by 2010, of which an estimated $70 million, net of transition costs, is expected to benefit 2009. We expect to incur approximately $120 million of restructuring charges associated with these actions, with the majority to be incurred in 2009. In addition to the savings from these new actions, we expect approximately $40 million of savings from previously implemented actions, which includes $12 million of benefits from the Paxar integration. The total incremental savings from implemented cost reduction actions discussed above are expected to be $110 million for 2009. We anticipate higher charges related to restructuring actions in 2009 compared to 2008. We anticipate lower interest expense in 2009, subject to currently anticipated retirements and or refinancings of currently outstanding indebtedness, and assuming a continuation of current market rates for our variable interest rate debt and commercial paper. The annual effective tax rate will be impacted by future events including changes in tax laws, geographic income mix, tax audits, closure of tax years, legal entity restructuring, and release of, or accrual for, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate can potentially have wide variances from quarter to quarter, resulting from interim reporting requirements and the recognition of discrete events. We anticipate our capital and software expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $150 million in 2009. 21 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 6,710.4 $ 6,307.8 $ 5,575.9 Cost of products sold 4,983.4 4,585.4 4,037.9 Gross profit 1,727.0 1,722.4 1,538.0 Marketing, general and administrative expense 1,304.3 1,182.5 1,011.1 Interest expense 115.9 105.2 55.5 Other expense, net 36.2 59.4 36.2 Income from continuing operations before taxes $ 270.6 $ 375.3 $ 435.2 As a Percent of Sales: % % % Gross profit (margin) 25.7 27.3 27.6 Marketing, general and administrative expense 19.4 18.7 18.1 Income from continuing operations before taxes 4.0 5.9 7.8 Sales Sales increased 6% in 2008 and 13% in 2007 driven primarily by acquisitions and the effect of currency translation. The acquisitions of Paxar and DM Label increased sales by an estimated $450 million in 2008. The acquisition of Paxar increased sales by an estimated $510 million in 2007. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately $167 million in 2008 compared to approximately $232 million in 2007. On an organic basis, sales declined 3% in 2008 and grew 1% in 2007. The decline in 2008 primarily reflected worsening global economic conditions in 2008, which were experienced first in the U.S., then Western Europe, then in our emerging markets. Organic sales growth of 1% in 2007 reflected international growth, partially offset by slower and more competitive market conditions in North America. Organic sales growth (or decline) by our major regions of operation was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 U.S. (7 )% (4 )% Europe (1 )% 3 % 3 % Asia 1 % 9 % 13 % Latin America 1 % 4 % 11 % On an organic basis, international sales were roughly flat in 2008, compared to growth of 4% in 2007. The growth in 2007 reflected increases in most of our businesses outside of the U.S., particularly in our emerging markets. In the U.S., sales on an organic basis declined 7% in 2008 and 4% in 2007 due primarily to the slowdown in the U.S. economy, combined with the reduction of inventories by customers, particularly in the Office and Consumer Products segment. In our Pressure sensitive Materials segment, soft market conditions experienced in the second half of 2007 in the roll materials businesses in North America and Europe continued in 2008, spreading to Latin America and Asia. In our Retail Information Services segment, we continued to experience weakness in domestic retail apparel markets in 2008 and began to experience weakness in the European retail markets. Our other specialty converting businesses also experienced declines in 2008 primarily due to lower volume in products sold to the automotive and housing construction industries. 22 Table of Contents Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for further information on segments. Gross Profit Gross profit margin in 2008 decreased from 2007 as higher gross profit margin associated with sales from the Paxar business and savings from restructuring actions and other sources of productivity were more than offset by the carryover effect of prior year price competition in the roll materials business, higher raw material and other cost inflation, negative product mix shifts (lower sales of higher gross profit margin products), as well as reduced fixed cost leverage on an organic basis. Gross profit margin in 2007 decreased from 2006 due to price competition and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business and higher raw material costs. The negative effect of these factors was partially offset by the addition of the higher gross profit margin Paxar business, as well as benefits from our ongoing productivity improvement and cost reduction actions. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense in 2008 increased from 2007, as benefits from productivity improvement initiatives and lower net transition costs related to the Paxar and DM Label acquisitions were more than offset by: Costs associated with the acquired businesses (totaling approximately $123 million, including $15 million in incremental amortization of intangibles) The negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency (approximately $13 million) Higher employee costs Marketing, general and administrative expense in 2007 increased from 2006, as savings from restructuring actions and other cost reductions were more than offset by: Costs associated with the Paxar business and related integration expense (totaling approximately $185 million, including $40 million in integration related transition costs and $12 million in amortization of intangibles) The negative impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $30 million). Interest Expense Interest expense increased 10%, or approximately $11 million, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in borrowings to fund the Paxar and DM Label acquisitions, partially offset by the benefit of lower interest rates. Other Expense, net (In millions, pretax) 2008 2007 2006 Restructuring costs $ 29.8 $ 21.6 $ 21.1 Asset impairment and lease cancellation charges 10.9 17.5 8.7 Asset impairment integration related 18.4 Other items (4.5 ) 1.9 6.4 Other expense, net $ 36.2 $ 59.4 $ 36.2 For all three years presented, Other expense, net consisted of charges for restructuring, including severance and other employee related costs, asset impairment charges, and lease cancellation costs, as described above in the Cost Reduction Actions and Paxar Acquisition related Actions sections herein. Refer also to Note 10, Cost Reduction Actions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In 2008, other items included in Other expense, net consisted of a gain on sale of investments ($4.5 million). 23 Table of Contents In 2007, other items included in Other expense, net included: Cash flow hedge loss ($4.8 million) Expenses related to a divestiture ($.3 million) Reversal of accrual related to a lawsuit ($3.2 million) In 2006, other items included in Other expense, net included: Accrual for environmental remediation costs ($13 million) Costs related to a lawsuit and a divestiture ($.8 million) Gain on sale of assets ($5.3 million) Gain on curtailment and settlement of a pension obligation ($1.6 million) Gain on sale of an investment ($10.5 million), partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Avery Dennison Foundation ($10 million) Net Income: (In millions, except per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 Income from continuing operations before taxes $ 270.6 $ 375.3 $ 435.2 Provision for income taxes 4.5 71.8 76.7 Income from continuing operations 266.1 303.5 358.5 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 14.7 Net income $ 266.1 $ 303.5 $ 373.2 Net income per common share $ 2.70 $ 3.09 $ 3.74 Net income per common share, assuming dilution $ 2.70 $ 3.07 $ 3.72 Net income as a percent of sales 4.0 % 4.8 % 6.7 % Effective tax rate from continuing operations 1.7 % 19.1 % 17.6 % Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate was approximately 2% for 2008 compared with approximately 19% for 2007. Our 2008 effective tax rate reflects $45.3 million of benefit from changes in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, favorable geographic income mix, and a $24.8 million detriment from accruals for uncertain tax positions. Refer to Note 11, Taxes on Income, for more information. Income from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations includes the divestiture of our raised reflective pavement markers business as noted in the Overview section above. The divestiture of this business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit ($14.9 million) due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business and a gain on sale of $1.3 million. Income from discontinued operations included net sales of approximately $7 million in 2006. 24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Pressure sensitive Materials Segment (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales including intersegment sales $ 3,816.2 $ 3,662.6 $ 3,397.8 Less intersegment sales (172.4 ) (164.9 ) (161.5 ) Net sales $ 3,643.8 $ 3,497.7 $ 3,236.3 Operating income(1) 252.3 318.7 301.6 (1) Includes lease cancellation charges in 2008 and 2006, restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in all years presented, and other items in 2007 and 2006 $ 10.4 $ 13.8 $ 9.3 Net Sales Sales in our Pressure sensitive Materials segment increased 4% in 2008 and 8% in 2007. The increase in reported sales for this segment included a favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $132 million in 2008 and approximately $174 million in 2007. Organic sales growth was 1% in 2008 and 3% in 2007, which reflected growth in our roll materials business in Asia, Latin America and Europe, partially offset by declines in our North American roll materials businesses. The growth resulting from market expansion in our roll materials business in Asia and Latin America during 2007 slowed in 2008. In Asia, the roll materials business experienced high single digit growth in 2008 compared to double digit growth in 2007. In Latin America, the roll materials business experienced low single digit growth in 2008 compared to mid single digit growth in 2007. Our roll materials business in Europe experienced low single digit organic sales growth in both 2008 and 2007. In our North American roll materials business, slow market conditions in 2008 and 2007 resulted in the low single digit decline in sales on an organic basis. In 2007, a more competitive environment due in part to capacity additions in the industry led to price reductions to maintain market share. In our graphics and reflective business, sales declined on an organic basis at a mid single digit rate in 2008, as growth in Asia and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Europe. The decline primarily reflected lower promotional spending on graphic products by businesses in response to weak market conditions. In 2007, our graphics and reflective business experienced mid single digit organic sales growth, as strong international growth was partially offset by declines in the U.S. Operating Income Decreased operating income in 2008 reflected the negative effects of raw material and other cost inflation and prior year price reductions (which more than offset the initial benefits of recent price increases), and negative product mix, partially offset by higher unit volume, and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. Increased operating income in 2007 reflected higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. These initiatives were partially offset by a more competitive pricing environment and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business, higher raw material costs, and transition costs related to restructuring actions. Operating income for all three years reflected restructuring and asset impairment charges. In 2008, operating income included lease cancellation charges. In 2007, operating income included a reversal of an accrual related to a lawsuit. In 2006, operating income included a gain on sale of assets, legal fees related to a lawsuit, and lease cancellation charges. 25 Table of Contents Retail Information Services Segment (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales including intersegment sales $ 1,550.8 $ 1,177.5 $ 671.4 Less intersegment sales (2.1 ) (2.1 ) (3.4 ) Net sales $ 1,548.7 $ 1,175.4 $ 668.0 Operating income (loss)(1)(2) 9.4 (5.7 ) 45.2 (1) Includes restructuring costs, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges for all years presented $ 11.4 $ 31.2 $ 11.2 (2) Includes transition costs associated with acquisition integrations $ 24.1 $ 43.0 $ Net Sales Sales in our Retail Information Services segment increased 32% in 2008 compared to an increase of 76% in 2007. In 2008, the increase reflected an estimated $450 million in sales from the Paxar and DM Label acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $7 million). In 2007, the increase reflected an estimated $510 million in sales from the Paxar acquisition and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $17 million). On an organic basis, sales declined 6% in 2008 reflecting continued weakness in the domestic retail apparel markets and weakness experienced in the European retail markets. Organic sales growth of approximately 1% in 2007 reflected increased sales for the European retail market, partially offset by a decline in orders related to apparel shipped to North American retailers and brand owners. Operating Income Increased operating income in 2008 reflected higher sales, incremental synergies and lower transition costs related to the Paxar integration, and savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by raw material and other cost inflation, and incremental amortization of acquisition intangibles. Operating loss in 2007 reflected transition costs and integration related asset impairment charges associated with the Paxar acquisition, amortization of acquisition intangibles and higher expenses due to investments for growth in Asia, including higher employee related costs. Higher operating costs were partially offset by higher sales and savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. Restructuring costs, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges were incurred in all three years. Office and Consumer Products Segment (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales including intersegment sales $ 937.0 $ 1,017.8 $ 1,073.8 Less intersegment sales (1.2 ) (1.6 ) (1.8 ) Net sales $ 935.8 $ 1,016.2 $ 1,072.0 Operating income(1) 144.5 173.6 187.4 (1) Includes restructuring costs for all years, asset impairment charges in 2008 and 2006, lease cancellation costs in 2007, and other items in 2007 and 2006 $ 12.2 $ 4.8 $ (2.3 ) Net Sales Sales in our Office and Consumer Products segment decreased 8% in 2008 and 5% in 2007. The decline in reported sales in both years reflected lower sales on an organic basis, partially offset by the favorable impact of 26 Table of Contents foreign currency translation (approximately $12 million in 2008 and $25 million in 2007). In 2007, the decline included the negative impact of product line divestitures (approximately $9 million). On an organic basis, sales declined approximately 9% in 2008 and 7% in 2007. These declines reflected a combination of weak end market demand and tighter inventory controls by customers. Operating Income Decreased operating income in 2008 reflected lower sales and cost inflation, partially offset by price increases and savings from restructuring actions and other productivity improvement initiatives. Decreased operating income in 2007 reflected lower sales and higher raw material costs, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and productivity improvement initiatives. Restructuring costs were incurred in all three years and asset impairment charges were incurred in 2008 and 2006. Operating income in 2007 included lease cancellation costs and expense related to a divestiture. In 2006, operating income included a gain from sale of assets, a gain from curtailment and settlement of a pension obligation, and a net gain from a product line divestiture. Other specialty converting businesses (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales including intersegment sales $ 608.5 $ 638.4 $ 614.0 Less intersegment sales (26.4 ) (19.9 ) (14.4 ) Net sales $ 582.1 $ 618.5 $ 599.6 Operating income(1) 6.0 27.1 17.8 (1) Includes restructuring and asset impairment charges for all years presented $ 2.8 $ 4.2 $ 3.7 Net Sales Sales in our other specialty converting businesses decreased 6% in 2008 and increased 3% in 2007. In 2008, the decrease reflected lower sales on an organic basis, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $17 million). In 2007, the increase reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $16 million), partially offset by the impact of a product line divestiture, net of a small acquisition (approximately $2 million). On an organic basis, sales declined 8% in 2008, reflecting lower volume in products sold to the automotive and housing construction industries, and the negative effect of exiting certain low margin products in our specialty tape business, partially offset by growth in our radio frequency identification (RFID) division. In 2007, sales grew 1% on an organic basis, as the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin products in our specialty tape business was more than offset by solid growth in other parts of the specialty tape business, as well as growth of the RFID division. Operating Income Decreased operating income for these businesses in 2008 reflected lower sales and cost inflation, partially offset by the benefit of productivity improvement initiatives and a reduction in operating loss in our RFID division. Increased operating income for these businesses in 2007 reflected higher sales, savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives, and a reduction in operating loss from the RFID division. Operating income for all years included restructuring costs and asset impairment charges. 27 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity Cash Flow from Operating Activities: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 266.1 $ 303.5 $ 373.2 Depreciation and amortization 278.4 242.9 201.4 Provision for doubtful accounts 17.7 18.7 31.8 Asset impairment and net loss (gain) on sale and disposal of assets 16.8 44.0 (7.8 ) Stock based compensation 29.0 21.6 24.1 Other non cash items, net (1.1 ) (6.6 ) 1.0 Trade accounts receivable 57.7 (17.7 ) (34.1 ) Inventories 16.5 (5.3 ) (24.6 ) Other current assets (30.0 ) 18.8 (45.6 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (15.8 ) (87.1 ) 8.9 Income taxes (deferred and accrued) (79.9 ) (31.4 ) 5.3 Other assets 20.8 (17.1 ) (11.0 ) Long term retirement benefits and other liabilities (36.5 ) 15.1 (11.8 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 539.7 $ 499.4 $ 510.8 For cash flow purposes, changes in assets and liabilities exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and certain non cash transactions (discussed in Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts below). In 2008, cash flow provided by operating activities improved compared to 2007 due to improved collection of trade accounts receivable; extended payment terms on accounts payable; decreased purchases and better management of inventory; lower rebate payments; and lower income tax payments, net of refunds. These positive factors were partially offset by higher payments for interest and higher material costs. In 2007, cash flow provided by operating activities decreased compared to 2006 primarily due to shorter vendor payment terms on accounts payable and higher payments for income taxes. These negative factors were partially offset by the collection of value added tax receivables in Europe in other current assets and lower contributions to our pension plans. Cash Flow from Investing Activities: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Purchase of property, plant and equipment $ (128.5 ) $ (190.5 ) $ (161.9 ) Purchase of software and other deferred charges (63.1 ) (64.3 ) (33.4 ) Payments for acquisitions (131.2 ) (1,291.9 ) (13.4 ) Proceeds from sale of investments, net 17.2 16.3 Proceeds from sale of businesses 19.1 Other 12.1 3.5 18.4 Net cash used in investing activities $ (293.5 ) $ (1,543.2 ) $ (154.9 ) Payments for acquisitions On April 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of DM Label. On June 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Paxar. This acquisition was initially funded by commercial paper borrowings, supported by a bridge revolving credit facility. 28 Table of Contents Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Payments for acquisitions during 2007 also included buy outs of minority interest shareholders associated with certain subsidiaries of RVL Packaging, Inc. and Paxar of approximately $4 million. Capital and Software Spending Significant capital projects in 2008 included investments for expansion in China and India serving both our materials and retail information services businesses. Significant information technology projects in 2008 included customer service and standardization initiatives. Proceeds from Sale of Businesses and Investments In 2008, we sold securities primarily held by our captive insurance company. In 2006, we sold a long term investment (proceeds of approximately $16 million), divested our raised reflective pavement marker business in the U.S. (proceeds of approximately $9 million), and divested a product line in Europe (proceeds of approximately $4 million). Cash Flow from Financing Activities: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net change in borrowings and payments of debt $ (40.7 ) $ 1,259.0 $ (140.1 ) Dividends paid (175.0 ) (171.8 ) (171.8 ) Purchase of treasury stock (9.8 ) (63.2 ) (157.7 ) Proceeds from exercise of stock options, net 2.7 38.1 54.1 Other 14.3 (6.7 ) 17.7 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (208.5 ) $ 1,055.4 $ (397.8 ) Borrowings and Repayment of Debt At year end 2008, our borrowings outstanding under foreign short term lines of credit were approximately $106 million (weighted average interest rate of 6.9%), compared to approximately $70 million at year end 2007 (weighted average interest rate of 10.6%). Short term variable rate domestic borrowings were $558 million at December 27, 2008 (weighted average interest rate of 0.9%), compared to $990.2 million at December 29, 2007 (weighted average interest rate of 5.2%). At December 27, 2008, short term variable rate domestic borrowings were from a mix of commercial paper and the revolving credit agreement. During 2007, we increased our short term borrowings to initially fund the Paxar acquisition, as noted above in Payments for acquisitions, as well as to support share repurchases. The change in outstanding commercial paper also reflects positive cash flow from operations. We had medium term notes of $50 million outstanding at year end 2008, compared to $100 million at year end 2007. In 2008 and 2007, medium term notes of $50 million and $60 million were paid on maturity, respectively. Refer to Capital Resources below for further information on the 2008 and 2007 borrowings and repayment of debt. Shareholders Equity Our shareholders equity was approximately $1.75 billion at year end 2008, compared to approximately $1.99 billion at year end 2007. Our annual dividend per share increased to $1.64 in 2008 from $1.61 in 2007. Share Repurchases On October 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase an additional 5 million shares of the Companys stock under our existing stock repurchase program, resulting in a total authorization of 29 Table of Contents approximately 7.4 million shares of the Companys stock at that date. We repurchased approximately .2 million and .8 million shares in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash payments for these repurchased shares were approximately $10 million and approximately $63 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in the 2007 cash payments were approximately $11 million related to shares repurchased in 2006, which settled in 2007. As of December 27, 2008, approximately 3.9 million shares were available for repurchase under the Board of Directors authorization. Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts Long lived Assets Goodwill increased $33 million during 2008 due to preliminary identified goodwill associated with the DM Label acquisition ($45 million) and purchase price adjustments ($10 million) associated with the Paxar acquisition completed in June 2007, partially offset by foreign currency translation ($22 million). Other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions decreased $11 million during 2008, which reflected normal amortization expense ($33 million) and the impact of foreign currency translation ($5 million), partially offset by our preliminary valuation of the intangible assets of the DM Label acquisition ($19 million) and incremental adjustments to intangible assets for the Paxar acquisition ($8 million). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Other assets decreased $115 million during 2008 due primarily to decreases in long term pension assets ($115 million) and cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance ($23 million), and the impact of foreign currency translation ($5 million), partially offset by increases in purchases of software and other deferred charges, net of related amortization ($23 million) and other assets ($5 million). Other Shareholders Equity Accounts The value of our employee stock benefit trust decreased $182 million in 2008 due to a decrease in the market value of shares held in the trust of approximately $174 million, and the issuance of shares under our employee stock option and incentive plans of approximately $8 million. Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income reflected a loss of $367 million during 2008 due primarily to a decline in the value of pension assets and current year recognition and amortization of net pension transition obligation, prior service cost, and net actuarial losses in our U.S. and international pension and other postretirement plans ($191 million), as well as foreign currency translation ($177 million). Impact of Foreign Currency Translation: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Change in net sales $ 168 $ 232 $ 21 Change in net income 8 13 2 In 2008, international operations generated approximately 67% of our net sales. Our future results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, which are influenced by global economic and political conditions. The benefit to sales from currency translation in 2008 primarily reflected a benefit from sales denominated in Euros and Swiss Francs, as well as sales in the currencies of China, Brazil, and Australia, partially offset by a negative impact of sales in the currencies of South Korea, Great Britain and South Africa. Translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies are included in net income in the period incurred. Operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years. In 2008 and 2007, we had no operations in hyperinflationary economies. In 2006, the only hyperinflationary economy in which we operated was the Dominican Republic, which uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. 30 Table of Contents Effect of Foreign Currency Transactions The impact on net income from transactions denominated in foreign currencies may be mitigated because the costs of our products are generally denominated in the same currencies in which they are sold. In addition, to reduce our income statement and cash flow exposure to transactions in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts, where available and appropriate. Analysis of Selected Financial Ratios We utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance, as discussed below. Operational Working Capital Ratio Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) as a percent of net sales changed in 2008 primarily due to the impact of the Paxar acquisition and a decrease in short term debt and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in net trade accounts receivable, inventories and current deferred tax assets, as well as a net increase in hedge liabilities and income taxes payable. In February 2008, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement for a term loan credit facility with fifteen domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of $400 million, which we guaranteed, maturing February 8, 2011. The proceeds from this term loan credit facility were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings (included in current liabilities) initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. Operational working capital, as a percent of net sales, is a non GAAP measure and is shown below. We use this non GAAP measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing and other activities (that affect cash and cash equivalents, deferred taxes, and other current assets and other current liabilities) that tend to be disparate in amount and timing and therefore, may increase the volatility of the working capital ratio from period to period. Additionally, the items excluded from this measure are not necessarily indicative of the underlying trends of our operations and are not significantly influenced by the day to day activities that are managed at the operating level. Refer to Uses and Limitations of Non GAAP Measures. Our objective is to minimize our investment in operational working capital as a percentage of sales by reducing this ratio to maximize cash flow and return on investment. Operational Working Capital: (In millions) 2008 2007 (A) Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) $ (127.6 ) $ (419.3 ) Reconciling items: Cash and cash equivalents (105.5 ) (71.5 ) Current deferred and refundable income taxes and other current assets (252.4 ) (242.0 ) Short term and current portion of long term debt 665.0 1,110.8 Current deferred and payable income taxes and other current liabilities 720.1 687.6 (B) Operational working capital $ 899.6 $ 1,065.6 (C) Net sales $ 6,710.4 $ 6,307.8 Working capital, as a percent of net sales(A) (C) (1.9 )% (6.6 )% Operational working capital, as a percent of net sales(B) (C) 13.4 % 16.9 % As a percent of net sales, operational working capital in 2008 decreased compared to 2007. The primary factors contributing to this change, which includes the impact of the Paxar acquisition and foreign currency translation, are discussed below. 31 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable Ratio The average number of days sales outstanding was 61 days in 2008 compared to 62 days in 2007, calculated using a four quarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the average daily sales for the year. The current year average number of days sales outstanding benefited from improved payment terms with our customers. The prior year average number of days sales outstanding was impacted primarily by the acquisition of Paxar, as well as the timing of sales and collections. Inventory Ratio Average inventory turnover was 7.8 in both 2008 and 2007, calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a four quarter average inventory balance. The current year average inventory turnover reflected the continued improvement of inventory management to adjust to the demand of our customers. In the prior year, this ratio was impacted primarily by the acquisition of Paxar. Accounts Payable Ratio The average number of days payable outstanding was 54 days in 2008 compared to 53 days in 2007, calculated using a four quarter average accounts payable balance divided by the average daily cost of products sold for the year. The current year average number of days payable outstanding was primarily due to improved payment terms with our suppliers, partially offset by lower inventory purchases. The prior year average number of days payable outstanding was impacted primarily by the timing of payments in Europe, partially offset by the acquisition of Paxar. Debt to Capital Ratio Year End 2008 2007 Debt to capital 55.8 % 53.1 % The increase in the debt to capital ratio in 2008 was primarily due to lower shareholders equity, which reflected the recognition of net pension transition obligation, prior service cost, and net actuarial losses on our U.S. and international pension and other postretirement plans, and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by a net decrease in debt. Our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios on total debt and interest expense in relation to certain measures of income. Under the loan agreements, the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other non cash expenses for the most recent twelve month fiscal period may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. In addition, earnings before interest, taxes, and other non cash expenses, as a ratio to interest for the most recent twelve month fiscal period may not be less than 3.5 to 1.0. As of December 27, 2008, we were in compliance with these debt covenants. In January 2009, we amended the covenants included in the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement to exclude certain restructuring charges and to adjust covenant levels. The adjusted covenant levels change quarterly and revert back to the pre amendment levels during 2010. The amendments also reflect increased pricing levels for borrowings under both agreements, consistent with the current pricing environment. Refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of future cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. At year end, the fair value of our total debt, including short term borrowings, was $1,944.2 million in 2008 and $2,250.7 million in 2007. Shareholders Equity Ratios 2008 2007 2006 Return on average shareholders equity 13.1 % 16.5 % 22.7 % Return on average total capital 8.8 10.6 15.7 32 Table of Contents Decreases in these ratios in 2008 compared to 2007 were primarily due to lower net income, as well as a higher yearly average of total debt outstanding and shareholders equity. These ratios are computed using actual net income and a five quarter average denominator for equity and total debt accounts. Capital Resources Capital resources include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents and debt financing. At year end 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $105.5 million held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, there is no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our $1 billion revolving credit facility, which supports our commercial paper programs in the U.S. and Europe, matures in 2012. Based upon our current outlook for our business and market conditions, we believe that this facility, in addition to the committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit maintained in the countries in which we operate, provide the liquidity to fund our operations. During the recent turmoil in the financial markets, we did not experience interruptions in our access to funding. We have $.5 million of long term debt maturities due in 2009. We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates, and to possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties. Our total debt decreased $46 million in 2008 to $2.21 billion compared to $2.26 billion at year end 2007, reflecting primarily a decrease in short term borrowings used for general operational requirements, partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings associated with the DM Label acquisition. Refer to Borrowings and Repayment of Debt in the Cash Flow from Financing Activities section above for more information. In August 2007, we amended our existing revolving credit agreement, increasing commitments from $525 million to $1 billion and extending the maturity to August 2012. Commitments were provided by twelve domestic and foreign banks. Financing available under the agreement will be used as a commercial paper back up facility and is also available to finance other corporate requirements. In January 2009, we amended the covenants related to this issuance as described above. Refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In September 2007, one of our subsidiaries issued $250 million 10 year senior notes, which we guaranteed, bearing interest at a rate of 6.625% per year, due October 2017. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $247 million and were used to pay down current long term debt maturities of $150 million and reduce commercial paper borrowings of $97 million initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to permit the issuance of debt and equity securities. Proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing debt, and for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. This shelf registration replaced the shelf registration statement filed in 2004. The HiMEDS units discussed below were issued under this registration statement. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we issued $440 million of 7.875% Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt issue. These HiMEDS units are comprised of two components purchase contracts obligating the holders to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million to approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the stock price at that time) and senior notes due in 2020. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $427 million, which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition. In February 2009, we commenced an offer to exchange up to approximately 8.4 million units, or 95%, of our HiMEDS units, stated amount $50.00 per unit, in the form of Corporate HiMEDS units. As the exchange is not mandatory, there is no assurance that the exchange will occur in part or in its entirety. Refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 33 Table of Contents In February 2008, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement for a term loan credit facility with fifteen domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of $400 million, which we guaranteed, maturing February 8, 2011. Financing available under the agreement is to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We used the term loan credit facility to reduce commercial paper borrowings previously issued to fund the acquisition of Paxar. The term loan credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In January 2009, we amended these covenants as described above. Refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In February 2008, we terminated our bridge revolving credit agreement, dated June 13, 2007, with five domestic and foreign banks. In addition, we have a 364 day revolving credit facility in which a foreign bank provides us up to Euro 30 million ($42.2 million) in borrowings through March 5, 2009. With the approval of the bank, we may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis. Financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements of our European operations. As of December 27, 2008, there was $42.2 million of debt outstanding under this agreement. There was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of December 29, 2007. We had standby letters of credit outstanding of $70.6 million and $80.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The aggregate contract amount of outstanding standby letters of credit approximated fair value. Our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately $468 million at year end 2008. Our uncommitted lines of credit have no commitment expiration date and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time. Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short term and long term financing. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings. When determining a credit rating, the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position, business outlook, consistency of cash flows, debt level and liquidity, geographic dispersion and management team. We remain committed to retaining an investment grade rating. Our Credit Ratings as of Year End 2008: Short term Long term Outlook Standard Poors Rating Service (SP) A 2 BBB Stable Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) P2 Baa1 (1) Negative (1) In January 2009, our long term credit rating was placed under review by Moodys for possible downgrade. Moodys expects the review to be completed by the end of April 2009. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations at Year End 2008: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Short term lines of credit $ 664.4 $ 664.4 $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt and capital leases(1) 1,545.3 .5 .6 405.2 250.0 889.0 Interest on long term debt(2) 872.1 75.8 75.8 75.8 75.8 64.1 504.8 Operating leases 250.9 64.6 49.6 39.2 30.5 20.1 46.9 Pension and postretirement benefit contributions 25.0 25.0 Total contractual obligations $ 3,357.7 $ 830.3 $ 126.0 $ 520.2 $ 106.3 $ 334.2 $ 1,440.7 34 Table of Contents (1) In January 2009, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement for a $400 million term loan credit facility (Credit Facility) maturing February 8, 2011. The amendment provides for the partial repayment of the loans under the Credit Facility in $15 million quarterly installments beginning April 2009 through December 2010, and $280 million payable upon maturity. Under the amended agreement, repayment of long term debt and capital leases is scheduled as follows: $60.5 million in 2009, $60.6 million in 2010, $285.2 million in 2011, $0 in 2012, $250 million in 2013, and $889 million thereafter. See Note 15, Subsequent Events, for more information. (2) Interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the index rate in effect as of December 27, 2008. We enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation. The terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations, except for the facility in Mentor, Ohio as noted below. The table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms of one year or more. On September 9, 2005, we completed the lease financing for a commercial facility (the Facility) located in Mentor, Ohio, used primarily for the new headquarters and research center for our roll materials division. The Facility consists generally of land, buildings, equipment and office furnishings. We have leased the Facility under an operating lease arrangement, which contains a residual value guarantee of $33.4 million. We estimate that the residual value of the Facility will not be less than the amount guaranteed. We did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end 2008 in the table of contractual obligations above, because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $23 million, which is the portion that may become payable during 2009. The resolution of the balance is contingent upon various unknown factors, and cannot be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 11, Taxes Based on Income to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on unrecognized tax benefits. Legal Proceedings We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices. The Board of Directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of certain independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters. We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These and other matters are reported in Note 8, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Matters We have been designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and or other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at seventeen waste disposal or waste recycling sites, including former Paxar sites, which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and or groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon. We are participating with other PRPs at such sites, and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the EPA or other governmental authorities. We have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a PRP, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued. 35 Table of Contents Environmental liabilities, which include costs associated with compliance and remediation, were as follows: December 27, December 29, (In millions) 2008 2007 Balance at beginning of year $ 37.8 $ 22.9 Purchase price adjustments related to acquisitions 24.6 21.5 Accruals .9 2.8 Payments (4.8 ) (9.4 ) Balance at end of year $ 58.5 $ 37.8 As of December 27, 2008, approximately $2 million associated with these environmental liabilities is estimated to be paid within the next 12 months. Our estimates could change depending on various factors, such as modification of currently planned remedial actions, changes in remediation technologies, changes in site conditions, a change in the estimated time to complete remediation, changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors. Other In 2005, we contacted relevant authorities in the U.S. and reported the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our reflective business in China, and involved, among other things, impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments. The payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration. Corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken. Sales of our reflective business in China in 2005 were approximately $7 million. Based on findings to date, no changes to our previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters. However, we believe that fines or other penalties could be incurred. While we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, we believe that our behavior in detecting, investigating, responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably. In addition, on or about October 10, 2008, we notified relevant authorities that we had discovered questionable payments to certain foreign customs and other regulatory officials by some employees of our recently acquired companies. These payments do not appear to have been made for the purpose of obtaining business from any governmental entity. We are in the process of conducting a review and are taking remedial measures to comply with the provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our business. Based upon current information, we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us. We provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized. These costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units, cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage. As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary. We participate in international receivable financing programs with several financial institutions whereby advances may be requested from these financial institutions. Such advances are guaranteed by us. At December 27, 2008, we had guaranteed approximately $13 million. As of December 27, 2008, we guaranteed up to approximately $22 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries obligations to their suppliers, as well as approximately $556 million of certain of our subsidiaries lines of credit with various financial institutions. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we issued $440 million of 7.875% Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt issue. These HiMEDS units are comprised of two components purchase contracts obligating the 36 Table of Contents holders to purchase from us a certain number of shares of our common stock in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million to approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the quoted price per share of our common stock at that time) and senior notes due in 2020. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $427 million. In February 2009, we commenced an offer to exchange up to approximately 8.4 million units, or 95%, of our HiMEDS units, stated amount $50.00 per unit, in the form of Corporate HiMEDS units. As the exchange is not mandatory, there is no assurance that the exchange will occur in part or in its entirety. Refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. USES AND LIMITATIONS OF NON GAAP MEASURES We use certain non GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative (e.g. gains on sales of assets, restructuring charges, asset impairments, etc.), from certain of our GAAP measures, management believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Companys core or underlying operating results. These non GAAP measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. Limitations associated with the use of our non GAAP measures include (1) the exclusion of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the calculation of organic sales growth; (2) the exclusion of mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash flow; and (3) the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents, short term debt, deferred taxes, and other current assets and other current liabilities, as well as current assets and current liabilities of held for sale businesses, for the calculation of operational working capital. While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that supplemental non GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Companys performance and operating trends. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS From time to time, we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties. We believe that such transactions are at arms length and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. One of our directors, Peter W. Mullin is the chairman, chief executive officer and a director of MC Insurance Services, Inc. (MC), Mullin Insurance Services, Inc. (MINC), and PWM Insurance Services, Inc. (PWM), executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents. Mr. Mullin is also the majority stockholder of MC, MINC and PWM (collectively referred to as the Mullin Companies). In October 2008, the Mullin Companies executive benefit and insurance agency related entities (MC Insurance Agency Service, LLC, MCIA, MullinTBG Insurance Agency Services, LLC MullinTBG, and MullinTBG Advisory Services, LLC MullinTBG Advisors) were sold to Prudential Financial (Prudential). We paid premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the Mullin Companies in connection with various of our employee benefit plans. The Mullin Companies and Prudential have advised us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and renewal of this insurance. Approximately 50% of these commissions were allocated to and used by MullinTBG (a previous affiliate of MC and now a wholly owned affiliate of Prudential) to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statement information to participants under various of our employee benefit plans. During 2008, MullinTBG Advisors provided financial advisory services to participants in certain of our employee benefit plans. The Mullin Companies own a minority interest in M Financial Holdings, Inc. (MFH). Substantially all of the life insurance policies, which we placed through the Mullin Companies in 2008 and prior years, are issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and M Life Insurance Company (M Life), a wholly owned subsidiary of MFH. Reinsurance returns earned by M Life are determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or positive, depending upon the results of M 37 Table of Contents Lifes aggregate reinsurance pool, which consists of the insured lives reinsured by M Life. The Mullin Companies have advised us that they participated in net reinsurance gains of M Life. In addition, the Mullin Companies have advised us that they also participated in net reinsurance gains of M Life that are subject to risk of forfeiture. None of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations.

These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and which require us to make difficult, subjective and or complex judgments. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. We believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, accounts receivable allowances, inventory and inventory reserves, long lived asset impairments, goodwill, pension and postretirement benefits, income taxes, stock based compensation, restructuring and severance costs, litigation and environmental matters, and business combinations. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, pricing is determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Furthermore, sales, provisions for estimated returns, and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks and rewards of ownership. Sales terms are generally f.o.b. (free on board) shipping point or f.o.b. destination, depending upon local business customs. For most regions in which we operate, f.o.b. shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded at the time of shipment, because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred. In certain regions, notably in Europe, f.o.b. destination terms are generally utilized and sales are recorded when the products are delivered to the customers delivery site, because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred. Actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances. Sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate. Volume, promotional, price, cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales. Rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold. These estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products. We review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available. 38 Table of Contents Sales Returns and Allowances Sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our customers (both affiliated and non affiliated) for the return of unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of return. We accrue for returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the products sold and historical experience for such products. We record these allowances based on the following factors: (i) customer specific allowances; and (ii) an estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues not yet identified. Accounts Receivable Allowances We are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy, historical experience and future expectations. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value. We record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors: (i) customer specific allowances; (ii) amounts based upon an aging schedule; and (iii) an estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues not yet identified. No single customer represented 10% or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2008 and 2007. However, our ten largest customers at year end 2008 represented approximately 13% of trade accounts receivable and consisted of five customers of our Office and Consumer Products segment, four customers of our Pressure sensitive Materials segment and one customer of both these segments. The financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis. Inventory and Inventory Reserves Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials, work in progress or finished goods. Cost is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserves are recorded for matters such as damaged, obsolete, excess and slow moving inventory. We use estimates to record these reserves. Slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory. Long lived Asset Impairments We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of long lived assets are determined not to be recoverable. Impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value. Fair value is typically determined using quoted market prices, if available, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The key estimates applied when preparing cash flow projections relate to revenues, gross margins, economic life of assets, overheads, taxation and discount rates. The amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our long lived assets. Goodwill Our reporting units for the purpose of performing the impairment tests for goodwill consist of roll materials; retail information services; office and consumer products; graphics and reflective products; industrial products; and business media. For the purpose of performing the required impairment tests, we primarily apply a present value (discounted cash flow) method to determine the fair value of the reporting units with goodwill. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter. Our reporting units are composed of either a discrete business or an aggregation of businesses with similar economic characteristics. Certain factors may result in the need to perform an impairment test prior to the fourth quarter, including significant underperformance of our business relative to expected operating results, significant adverse economic and industry trends, significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value, and a decision to divest an individual business within a reporting unit. 39 Table of Contents Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. The second step, if necessary, compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. Assumptions about discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies. Assumptions about sales, operating margins, and growth rates are based on our forecasts, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period. Because of the increased uncertainty resulting from worsening global economic conditions, our revenue projections generally assumed reductions in 2009 and a period of recovery beginning in 2010. Our first step impairment analysis for 2008 indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value. The fair values of our reporting units, except for the retail information services reporting unit, exceeded the carrying amount by more than 100% of the respective reporting units book value of goodwill at December 27, 2008. The fair value of our retail information services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5% of its book value of goodwill at December 27, 2008 (approximately $1.2 billion). In evaluating the fair value of our retail information services reporting unit, we assumed revenue declines for 2009 from 2008 reflecting a continuation of weakness in the retail apparel markets. We then assumed revenue in 2010 increased to levels comparable with fiscal year 2007 (including estimated sales for Paxar and DM Label, adjusted for foreign currency translation). We also assumed a discount rate of 11.8% and a perpetual growth rate of 3% reflecting the market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008. The retail information services business is seasonal, with higher volume in the second quarter. We may need to perform an impairment test in the second quarter of 2009 if revenues or results for this reporting unit during the first and second quarters of 2009 are below our estimates, the perpetual growth rate is decreased below 2.7%, the discount rate increases above 12%, or other key assumptions used in our fair value calculations in the fourth quarter of 2008 change. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Effective December 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care costs, future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost. Discount Rate We, in consultation with our actuaries, annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market 40 Table of Contents rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. In the U.S., our discount rate is determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans. Long term Return on Assets We determine the long term rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets, taking into consideration that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater return over the long run. Additionally, current market conditions, such as interest rates, are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. Healthcare Cost Trend Rate Our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a cash basis. For measurement purposes, a 7% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2009. This rate is expected to decrease to approximately 5% by 2011. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods. Income taxes have not been provided on certain undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Pursuant to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, when establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future sources of taxable income such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. SFAS No. 109 defines a tax planning strategy as an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets. In the event we determine the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. We have also acquired certain net deferred tax assets with existing valuation allowances. If it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, we will release the valuation allowance to current earnings or adjust the purchase price allocation. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to managements assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time, pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 requires a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to FIN 48 and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate. 41 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation We recognize expense for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of the SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Valuation of Stock Options Our stock based compensation expense is the estimated fair value of options granted, amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of each of our stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. This model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and the expected life of the options. Expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend divided by the 12 month average of our monthly stock price prior to grant. Expected volatility for options was determined based on an average of implied and historical volatility. Risk free rate was based on the average of the 52 week average of the Treasury Bond rate that has a term corresponding to the expected option term. Expected term was determined based on historical experience under our stock option plans. Forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical data of our stock option forfeitures. Certain of the assumptions used above are based on managements estimates. As such, if factors change and such factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates, our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different in the future. We have not capitalized costs associated with stock based compensation. Accounting for Income Taxes for Stock based Compensation We elected to use the short cut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee stock based compensation awards. In addition, we elected to follow the tax ordering laws to determine the sequence in which deductions and net operating loss carryforwards are utilized, as well as the direct only approach to calculating the amount of windfall or shortfall tax benefits. Restructuring and Severance Costs We account for restructuring costs including severance and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the guidance provided in SFAS No. 112, Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, and SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. In the U.S., we have a severance pay plan (Pay Plan), which provides eligible employees with severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination due to qualifying cost reduction actions. We calculate severance pay using the severance benefit formula under the Pay Plan. Accordingly, we record provisions for such amounts and other related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set forth under SFAS No. 112. In the absence of a Pay Plan or established local practices for overseas jurisdictions, liability for severance and other employee related costs is recognized when the liability is incurred, following the guidance of SFAS No. 146. Litigation and Environmental Matters We are currently involved in various lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated, the best estimate within the range, or if the most likely amount cannot be determined, the low end of the range is accrued. The ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results of operations should our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued. 42 Table of Contents Environmental expenditures are generally expensed. However, environmental expenditures for newly acquired assets and those which extend or improve the economic useful life of existing assets are capitalized and amortized over the remaining asset life. We review each reporting period our estimates of costs of compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of various sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us a potentially responsible party. When it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated, the best estimate within the range is accrued. When the best estimate within the range cannot be determined, the low end of the range is accrued. Potential insurance reimbursements are not offset against potential liabilities, and such liabilities are not discounted. Business Combinations We account for business combinations using the accounting requirements of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquired businesses at fair value, and we make estimates and assumptions to determine such fair values. We utilize a variety of assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable in determining fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These assumptions and estimates include discounted cash flow analysis, growth rates, discount rates, current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain assets, market rate assumptions for certain obligations and certain potential costs of compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of acquired properties. We also utilize information obtained from management of the acquired businesses and our own historical experience from previous acquisitions. We apply significant assumptions and estimates in determining certain intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions (such as customer relationships, patents and other acquired technology, and trademarks and trade names and related applicable useful lives), property, plant and equipment, receivables, inventories, investments, tax accounts, environmental liabilities, stock option awards, lease commitments and restructuring and integration costs. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. As such, increases to estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period (generally within one year of the acquisition date) and as operating expenses thereafter. Effective January 2009, we will adopt SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. We are currently evaluating the impact of this Statement on our financial results of operations and financial position. RECENT ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS During 2008, we adopted certain accounting and financial disclosure requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) and Financial Interpretations by the staff of the FASB, none of which had a significant impact on our financial results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT The matters discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Words such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, guidance, intend, may, might, objective, plan, potential, project, seek, shall, should, target, will, would, or variations thereof and other expressions, which refer to future events and trends, identify forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements, and financial or other business targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results, performance or achievements of the Company expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. 43 Table of Contents Certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 27, 2008, and include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new production facilities; fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions; ability of the Company to generate sustained productivity improvement; successful integration of acquisitions; successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment; the financial condition and inventory strategies of customers; customer and supplier concentrations; changes in customer order patterns; loss of significant contract(s) or customer(s); timely development and market acceptance of new products; fluctuations in demand by retailers and other customers for our products; impact of competitive products and pricing; selling prices; possible increases in per unit product manufacturing costs due to less than full utilization of manufacturing capacity as a result of changing economic conditions and other factors; possible increases in payment time for receivables as a result of changing economic conditions or other factors; business mix shift; volatility of capital and credit markets; credit risks; ability of the Company to obtain adequate financing arrangements and to maintain access to capital; fluctuations in interest rates; fluctuations in pension, insurance and employee benefit costs; impact of legal proceedings, including a previous government investigation into industry competitive practices, and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining thereto or to the subject matter thereof related to the concluded investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) (including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation), as well as the impact of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; changes in governmental regulations; changes in political conditions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations; worldwide and local economic conditions; impact of epidemiological events on the economy and the Companys customers and suppliers; acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters; and other factors. The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its financial performance in the near term include (1) the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for the Companys products; (2) the impact of competitors actions, including pricing, expansion in key markets, and product offerings; (3) the degree to which higher costs can be offset with productivity measures and or passed on to customers through selling price increases, without a significant loss of volume; (4) potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and or investigations, including possible fines, penalties, judgments or settlements; and (5) the ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions. The Companys forward looking statements represent judgment only on the dates such statements were made. By making such forward looking statements, the Company assumes no duty to update them to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or circumstances, other than as may be required by law. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency, interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes. Our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income. Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings. In June 2007 and August 2007, we entered into certain interest rate option contracts to hedge our exposure related to interest rate increases in connection with our 44 Table of Contents anticipated long term debt issuances. Such debt issuances were intended to replace the short term borrowings initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition and to support the refinancing of our current long term debt maturities. In connection with these transactions, we paid $11.5 million as option premiums, of which $4.8 million was recognized during 2007 as a cash flow hedge loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income and $6.7 million is being amortized over the life of the related forecasted hedged transactions. Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations. These amounts are not material to our financial statements. In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions, other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price risk and litigation risk, which are not represented in the analyses that follow. Foreign Exchange Value At Risk We use a Value At Risk (VAR) model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts. This approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions. Firm commitments, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were included in the model. Forecasted transactions, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency. The volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on two year historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks. A 95% confidence level was used for a one day time horizon. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately $1.7 million at year end 2008. Interest Rate Sensitivity An assumed 30 basis point move in interest rates (10% of our weighted average interest rate on floating rate debt) affecting our variable rate borrowings would have had an estimated $4 million effect on our 2008 earnings.
