Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, this financial review should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Form 10 K. Disclosure and Internal Controls As of August 31, 2002, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of AutoZones management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, AutoZones management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 31, 2002. No significant changes in AutoZones internal controls or in other factors have occurred that could significantly affect controls subsequent to August 31, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies Product Warranties We provide our customers limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties. We provide a reserve for warranty obligations at the time of sale based on each products historical return rate. Certain product vendors pay all or a portion of our warranty expense. However, at times, the vendors may not cover all of the warranty expense. If we materially underestimate our warranty expense on products that are not fully warranted to us by our vendors, we may experience a material adverse impact on our reported financial position or results of operations. If we incorrectly estimate our warranty expense, we will recognize any adjustment in income at the time it is determined. Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities We have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business, such as employment matters, product liability, general liability related to our store premises and alleged violation of the Robinson Patman Act (as specifically described in Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities, such as lawsuits and our retained liability for insured claims. We do not believe that any of these contingent liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, if our estimates related to these contingent liabilities are incorrect, the future results of operations for any particular fiscal quarter or year could be materially adversely affected. Some of our litigation is being conducted before juries in states where past jury awards have been significant, and we are unable to predict the results of any jury verdict. If we incorrectly estimate our contingent liabilities, we will recognize any adjustment in income at the time it is determined. 17 Table of Contents Vendor Allowances We receive various payments and allowances from our vendors based on volume of purchases and in payment of services that AutoZone provides to the vendors. Monies received from vendors include rebates, allowances and cooperative advertising funds. Typically these funds are determined periodically and are, at times, dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans. Certain vendor allowances are used exclusively for promotions and other direct expenses and are recognized as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses when earned. Rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases and or product sales. These monies are treated as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold. The amounts to be received are subject to changes in market conditions, vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell through of the related merchandise for AutoZone. Restructuring and Impairment Charges In fiscal 2001, AutoZone recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $156.8 million. The planned closure of 51 domestic auto parts stores and the disposal of real estate projects in process and excess properties accounted for the largest portion, or $56.1 million, of the charge. In fiscal 2002, these stores were closed, and sales of certain excess properties resulted in gains of approximately $2.6 million. Remaining excess properties are currently being marketed for sale. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, all remaining excess properties were reevaluated. At that time, it was determined that several properties could be developed. This resulted in the reversal of accrued lease obligations totaling $6.4 million. It was also determined that additional writedowns were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair value. These writedowns totaled $9.0 million. Because fiscal 2002 adjustments offset, there was no impact on net income. Another portion of the charge, $32.0 million, related to other asset writedowns and the accrual of lease obligations associated with the closure of a supply depot and for the unoccupied ALLDATA office building. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the ALLDATA office building was sold to a third party. The reserve previously established was adequate to cover the loss incurred on the sale. We continue to pursue the sale, sublease or early termination of the leases associated with the remaining leased facilities. 18 Table of Contents We also reserved $30.1 million for inventory rationalization, including a provision for inventory losses in closed stores. All of the scheduled recalls and disposals of inventory took place during fiscal 2002. The reserve was adequate to cover losses incurred. Asset writedowns and contractual obligations aggregating $29.9 million related to the planned sale of TruckPro, our heavy duty truck parts subsidiary, were recorded. In December 2001, TruckPro was sold to a group of investors for cash proceeds of $25.7 million and a promissory note. We have deferred a gain on the sale of $3.6 million due to uncertainties associated with the realization of the gain. Refer to Note K in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction. The remainder of the restructuring and impairment charges, $8.7 million, related to contractual obligations, severance and other charges. We did not reverse any reserves into income. Total remaining accrued obligations for restructuring charges were $18.1 million at August 31, 2002. The following table presents a summary of the activity in accrued obligations for the restructuring charges: Contract Settlements/ Severance (in thousands) Lease Obligations Terminations Other Beginning balance $ 29,576 $ 6,713 $ 2,715 Cash outlays/adjustments 11,436 6,713 2,715 Balance at August 31, 2002 $ 18,140 $ $ Fiscal 2002 Compared with Fiscal 2001 Net sales for fiscal 2002 increased by $507.3 million or 10.5% over net sales for fiscal 2001. Excluding TruckPro, which was sold during the year, net sales increased 13%. The sales increases were attributable to a 9% increase in comparable store sales, or sales for domestic auto parts stores opened at least one year. New store sales in fiscal year 2002 contributed two percentage points and net sales from the 53rd week contributed approximately two percentage points of the increase. Comparable store sales increased as a result of an increase in customer count and an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over the amounts in the prior year. At August 31, 2002, we operated 3,068 domestic auto parts stores and 39 in Mexico, compared with 3,019 domestic auto parts stores, 21 in Mexico and 49 TruckPro stores at August 25, 2001. 19 Table of Contents Gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $2.4 billion, or 44.6% of net sales, compared with $2.0 billion, or 42.4% of net sales (excluding nonrecurring charges) for fiscal 2001. Gross margin improvement reflected lower product costs, more efficient supply chain costs, reduced inventory shrinkage, the benefits of more strategic and disciplined pricing due to category management and the addition of more value added, high margin merchandise than in the prior year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002 increased by $105.5 million over such expenses for fiscal 2001 but declined as a percentage of net sales from 31.1% to 30.1% (excluding nonrecurring charges in the prior year). The improved ratio reflects the fact that revenues rose more rapidly than the growth of store level expenses (a 1.1 percentage point improvement), combined with operating savings resulting from the restructuring in fiscal year 2001 related to controlling staffing, base salaries and technology spending of 0.4 percentage points. Additionally, the prior year included other expenses related to strategic initiatives not included in the restructuring and impairment charges of 0.3 percentage points. The adoption of new accounting rules for goodwill reduced operating expenses in fiscal 2002 by approximately $8.6 million, or 0.2 percentage points. These improvements in the expense ratio were partially offset by additional bonus, legal, pension and insurance expenses incurred in the current year of 1.1 percentage points. Net interest expense for fiscal year 2002 was $79.9 million compared with $100.7 million during fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower levels of debt compared with the prior fiscal year and lower average interest rates on short term borrowings. Weighted average borrowings for fiscal year 2002 were $1.33 billion, compared with $1.45 billion for fiscal 2001. Additionally, weighted average borrowing rates were lower in the current year compared with the prior year at 4.41% compared with 6.24%. AutoZones effective income tax rate was 38.1% of pretax income for fiscal 2002 and 38.8% for fiscal 2001. The decrease in the tax rate is due primarily to the change in goodwill accounting. Fiscal 2001 Compared with Fiscal 2000 Net sales for fiscal 2001 increased by $335.5 million or 7.5% over net sales for fiscal 2000. Same store sales, or sales for domestic auto parts stores opened at least one year, increased 4%. Additionally, new store sales in fiscal 2001 contributed 3% of the sales increase. The remaining sales increase was due to increased sales in our Mexico stores, ALLDATA and TruckPro. At August 25, 2001, we operated 3,019 domestic auto parts stores compared with 2,915 at August 26, 2000. Gross profit for fiscal 2001 (excluding nonrecurring charges) was $2.0 billion, or 42.4% of net sales, compared with $1.9 billion, or 41.9% of net sales, for fiscal 2000. The increase in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher gross margin products in the current year and higher warranty expense in the prior year. 20 Table of Contents Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2001 increased by $130.6 million over such expenses for fiscal 2000 (excluding nonrecurring charges) and increased as a percentage of net sales from 30.5% to 31.1%. The increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to an increase in group insurance expenses of 0.1 percentage points, an increase in risk management insurance expenses of 0.1 percentage points, an increase in other expenses related to strategic initiatives not included in the restructuring and impairment charges of 0.3 percentage points and higher levels of payroll of 0.1 percentage points, primarily in the first half of the year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2001 was $100.7 million compared with $76.8 million for fiscal 2000. The increase in interest expense is due to higher weighted average borrowings in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000. Weighted average borrowings were $1.45 billion in fiscal 2001 compared with $1.18 billion in fiscal 2000. Weighted average borrowing rates were slightly lower in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000 at 6.24% compared with 6.37%. AutoZones effective income tax rate was 38.8% of pretax income for fiscal 2001 and 38.5% for fiscal 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements AutoZones primary capital requirements have been the funding of its continued new store development program, inventory requirements and stock repurchases. We opened or acquired 1,340 net new domestic auto parts stores from the beginning of fiscal 1998 to August 31, 2002. Cash flow generated from store operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities was $739.1 million in fiscal 2002, $458.9 million in fiscal 2001 and $513.0 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in cash flow from operations in the current year is due primarily to higher net income, a larger increase in accounts payable and accruals and higher employee stock option exercises. We invested $117.2 million in capital assets in fiscal 2002 compared with $169.3 million in fiscal year 2001 and $249.7 million in fiscal year 2000. In fiscal 2002, we opened 102 new auto parts stores in the U.S. and 18 in Mexico, replaced 15 U.S. stores and closed 53 U.S. stores. During the year we sold TruckPro, our heavy duty truck parts subsidiary, which operated 49 stores, for cash proceeds of $25.7 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $64.5 million in fiscal 2002, compared with $122.1 million in fiscal 2001 and $242.3 million in fiscal 2000. Our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required by expansion. We believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through favorable payment terms from suppliers, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such terms. 21 Table of Contents Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance will be funded through borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt market in the past. Credit Ratings At August 31, 2002, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from Standard Poors of BBB and a commercial paper rating of A 2. Moodys Investors Service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2 and a commercial paper rating of P 2. Both rating agencies had AutoZone listed as having a negative outlook. Subsequent to year end, Standard Poors changed its outlook for AutoZone to positive and Moodys changed its outlook to stable. If these credit ratings drop, AutoZones interest expense may increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will increase, as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit. If our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become more limited, and obligations under our equity forward agreements may be accelerated, requiring the agreements to be settled prior to their planned settlement date. Debt Facilities We maintain $950 million of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks. Of the $950 million, $300 million expires in May 2003. The remaining $650 million expires in May 2005. The 364 day facility expiring in May 2003 includes a renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity date of the then outstanding debt by one year. The credit facilities exist largely to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured bank loans. At August 31, 2002, outstanding commercial paper of $223.2 million is classified as long term as we have the ability and intention to refinance it on a long term basis. The rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the lending banks base rate (as defined in the agreement) or a competitive bid rate at our option. We have agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of our credit agreements, including limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens and minimum fixed charge coverage. During fiscal year 2001, we entered into $200 million and $115 million unsecured bank term loans with a group of banks. During fiscal 2002, the $200 million two year unsecured term loan was increased to $350 million and the maturity was extended to November 2004. The rate of interest payable is a function of LIBOR or the banks base rate (as defined in the agreement) at our option. After the fiscal year end, on October 1, 2002, we filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing will allow us to sell as much as $500 million in debt securities for general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing debt, and or to fund working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. On October 16, 2002, we issued $300 million of 5.875% Senior Notes under the registration statement. The Notes mature in October 2012 and interest is payable semi annually on April 15 and October 15. 22 Table of Contents All of the repayment obligations under our bank lines of credit may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if AutoZone experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements) of AutoZone or its Board of Directors or if covenants are breached related to total indebtedness and minimum fixed charge coverage. We expect to remain in compliance with these covenants. Stock Repurchases As of August 31, 2002, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $2.3 billion of common stock in the open market. From January 1998 to August 31, 2002, approximately $2.1 billion of common stock had been repurchased, including shares committed under outstanding forward purchase contracts. During fiscal 2002, we repurchased $699.0 million of common stock. The impact of the fiscal 2002 stock repurchases on earnings per share in fiscal 2002 was an increase of $0.16. Subsequent to year end, we repurchased 1.1 million shares in partial settlement of the forward purchase contract outstanding at August 31, 2002, at an average cost of $69.91 per share. At times, we utilize equity forward agreements to facilitate our repurchase of common stock and to lock in current market prices for later purchase. Our obligations under the equity forward agreements are not reflected on our balance sheet. AutoZone, at its option, may settle the forward purchase agreements in cash or in common stock. Financial Commitments The following table shows AutoZones obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations: Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Between Between (in thousands) Obligations Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Long term debt $ 1,194,517 $ $ 1,004,517 $ $ 190,000 Synthetic leases 28,194 28,194 Other operating leases 658,554 117,215 190,686 129,289 221,364 Construction obligations 16,034 16,034 $ 1,897,299 $ 133,249 $ 1,195,203 $ 157,483 $ 411,364 23 Table of Contents The following table shows AutoZones other commitments: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Other Between Between Over 5 (in thousands) Commitments Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years years Standby letters of credit $ 31,715 $ 31,715 $ $ $ Surety bonds 23,660 23,660 Share repurchase obligations 150,058 150,058 $ 205,433 $ 205,433 $ $ $ A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation carrier. In conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some of our commercial customers. The receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. AutoZone has established a reserve for this recourse. At August 31, 2002, the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of $23.5 million and the balance of the recourse reserve was $1.9 million. AutoZone has a synthetic lease facility of $30 million in total. The facility expires in fiscal 2006. At August 31, 2002, $28.2 million in synthetic lease obligations were outstanding, relating to a small number of our domestic auto parts stores. The synthetic leases qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes and are not reflected as an asset or a liability on our balance sheet. The lease payments on the stores are reflected in the income statement in operating expenses and we depreciate the underlying assets for tax purposes. We have subleased some of our leased real property to other entities, including the purchaser of our former TruckPro business. If the purchaser of the TruckPro business becomes unable to meet its obligations under the subleases, we might incur liabilities in connection with the recovery and subsequent sublease or lease termination of the properties. Inflation AutoZone does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation. We have been successful, in many cases, in mitigating the effects of merchandise cost increases principally through efficiencies gained through economies of scale, selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers. Seasonality and Quarterly Periods AutoZones business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring in the summer months of June through August, in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months of December through February. During short periods of time, AutoZones business is also affected by weather conditions. 24 Table of Contents Extremely hot or extremely cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the long run, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States. Each of the first three quarters of AutoZones fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks (17 weeks in fiscal 2002). Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks (17 weeks in fiscal 2002), compared to 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 represented 34.6% of annual net sales and 41.6% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, excluding nonrecurring charges, represented 34.1% of annual net sales and 43.9% of net income. Fiscal year 2002 consisted of 53 weeks, with the fiscal fourth quarter including 17 weeks. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, but retains many of its fundamental provisions. Additionally, SFAS 144 expands the scope of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for AutoZones 2003 fiscal year. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 144 to have a significant financial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) and requires that a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 146 to have a significant financial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 Table of Contents Risk Factors We may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates. We have significantly increased our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 1,728 stores at August 30, 1997, to 3,068 stores at August 31, 2002, an average store count increase per year of 14%. We do not plan to continue our store count growth rate at the historic pace. In addition, a portion of our total sales increases each year results from increases in sales at existing stores. We cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to increase same store sales. Our business depends upon qualified employees. At the end of fiscal year 2002, our consolidated employee count was approximately 44,200. We do not know if we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we do not increase our wages competitively, our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or, alternatively, our earnings would decrease if we increase our wage rates. If demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially affected. Demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors. In the short term, it may depend upon: the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as increased vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors. the number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old and older, as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles. the weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of severe weather impacting a wide geographic area. the economy. In periods of rapidly declining economic conditions, both do it yourself and do it for me customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair. During periods of expansionary economic conditions, more of our do it yourself customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles. For the long term, demand for our products may depend upon: the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty offered on new vehicles. 26 Table of Contents restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation. If we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell, we could lose customers and our revenues and profits may decline. The sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas, including name recognition, product availability, customer service, store location and price, with many competitors. AutoZone competes in both the DIY and commercial auto parts and accessories markets. Competitors include national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners, merchandise quality, selection and availability, product warranty, store layout, location and convenience, and the strength of our AutoZone brand name, some competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater financial and marketing resources, larger stores with more merchandise, longer operating histories, more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising. If we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or our competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and our revenues and profits may decline. If we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto parts business, our sales growth may be limited. Although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial do it for me market, to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors, in addition to other auto parts retailers that have recently entered the commercial business. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, merchandise quality, selection and availability, and distribution locations, some automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have, have developed long term customer relationships and have larger available inventories. We can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers. If our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for our merchandise. Recently, several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge. Further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products. 27 Table of Contents Consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business. Recently, several large auto parts chains have merged. We do not know what impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket. If our merging competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers, then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are strongest. War, acts of terrorism, or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales. In the event of war, acts of terrorism, or either are threatened, it may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected. In the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk AutoZone is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. To reduce such risks, we may periodically use various financial instruments. To date, foreign exchange exposure has not been material. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to policies and procedures. Further, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivatives and Hedging Financial market risk relating to AutoZones operations results primarily from changes in interest rates. We comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 133, 137 and 138 (collectively SFAS 133) pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires us to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. AutoZone reduces its exposure to increases in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements. All of our interest rate swaps and treasury locks are designated as cash flow hedges. AutoZone has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. At August 31, 2002, and at August 25, 2001, we held interest rate swap contracts related to $190 million of variable rate debt. Of the $190 million, $115 million of the swaps mature in December 2003 and are used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with AutoZones $115 million term loan. The remaining $75 million of swaps expire throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004, and are used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings. Additionally, at August 31, 2002, we held treasury lock agreements with notional amounts of $300 million that expire in October 2002 and are used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows of anticipated debt transactions. The agreements will be settled upon the issuance of the debt. Upon settlement of the agreements, the realized gain or loss to be paid or received by AutoZone will be amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. 28 Table of Contents In accordance with SFAS 133, AutoZone reflects the current fair value of interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements on its balance sheet. The related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related interest rates being hedged have been recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate swap contract or treasury lock agreement does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the interest rate being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2002, and August 25, 2001, all of our interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements were determined to be highly effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in income. The fair value of AutoZones debt was estimated at $1.22 billion as of August 31, 2002, and $1.21 billion as of August 25, 2001, based on the market values of the debt at those dates. Such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt at August 31, 2002, by $27.2 million and less than the carrying value of debt at August 25, 2001, by $17.3 million. We had $699.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 31, 2002, and $730.4 million outstanding at August 25, 2001. At these borrowing levels, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on AutoZones pretax earnings and cash flows of $5.1 million in 2002 and $6.6 million in 2001, which includes the effects of interest rate swaps. The primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR.
