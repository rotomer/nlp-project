Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, this financial review should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Form 10 K. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002 For the year ended August 30, 2003, AutoZone reported sales of $5.457 billion (52 weeks) compared with $5.326 billion (53 weeks) for the year ended August 31, 2002, a 2.5% increase from fiscal 2002. At August 30, 2003, we operated 3,219 domestic auto parts stores and 49 in Mexico, compared with 3,068 domestic auto parts stores and 39 in Mexico at August 31, 2002. Excluding sales from the extra week included in the prior year, sales were up 4.6% (see Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures). Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased approximately 3% during the year, including flat retail same store sales and an increase for commercial sales in same stores by approximately 27%. The improvement in same store sales was due more to an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over the amounts in the same period of the prior year than an increase in customer count. The balance, of the increase of 4.6%, was due to new store sales for fiscal 2003 which contributed 1.9 percentage points of the increase; ALLDATA and Mexico sales which contributed 0.5 percentage points of the increase, while TruckPro sales in the prior year of $47.6 million reduced the increase by 0.9 percentage points. Gross profit for fiscal 2003 was $2.515 billion, or 46.1% of net sales, compared with $2.375 billion, or 44.6% of net sales for fiscal 2002. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2003 decreased to $1.597 billion, or 29.3% of net sales, from $1.604 billion, or 30.1% of sales for fiscal 2002. For fiscal 2003, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, improved by 1.5 percentage points, while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined by 0.8 percentage points. Operating profit for fiscal 2003 increased 19% over the prior year. Gross profit, operating expenses and operating profit for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 were impacted by the following non recurring or infrequent items: For fiscal 2003, a $4.6 million pre tax gain as a result of the disposition of properties associated with the fiscal 2001 restructuring and impairment charges For fiscal 2003, a $10.0 million pre tax negative impact and the reclassification of certain vendor funding to increase operating expenses by $53 million and decrease cost of goods sold by $43 million, both as a result of the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 16 regarding vendor funding For fiscal 2003, a $4.7 million pre tax gain associated with the settlement of certain liabilities and the repayment of a note associated with the fiscal 2002 sale of the TruckPro business 20 Table of Contents For fiscal 2002, the favorable impact of the additional week of the 53 week fiscal year For fiscal 2003, excluding the above items, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, improved by 0.7 percentage points while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined by 1.9 percentage points. Comparable operating profit for fiscal 2003 increased by 23.9%, as operating margin improved 2.6 percentage points to 16.8% from 14.2% last year (see Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures). The improvements in gross profit and gross margin reflect the additive impact of new merchandise, a reduction in our product warranty expense, and the benefit of more strategic and disciplined pricing derived from our category management system. Improvements, in operating profit and operating margin, reflect our relentless expense discipline, in particular, the leveraging of salaries and information technology spending during fiscal 2003. Net interest expense for fiscal 2003 was $84.8 million compared with $79.9 million during fiscal 2002. The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher levels of debt compared with the 2002 fiscal year. Weighted average borrowings for fiscal 2003 were $1.51 billion, compared with $1.33 billion for fiscal 2002; and, weighted average borrowing rates, excluding the impact of debt amortization and facility fees, remained relatively flat at 4.4% for both fiscal years. AutoZones effective income tax rate declined slightly to 37.9% of pretax income for fiscal 2003 as compared to 38.1% for fiscal 2002. Net income for fiscal 2003 increased by 20.9% to $517.6 million, and diluted earnings per share increased by 33.5% to $5.34 from $4.00 reported for the year ago period. Excluding the non recurring, infrequent items listed above, comparable net income increased 26.4% and diluted earnings per share increased 39.4% (see Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures). The impact of the fiscal 2003 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2003 was an increase of $0.19. Fiscal 2002 Compared with Fiscal 2001 Net sales for fiscal 2002 increased by $507.3 million, or 10.5%, over net sales for fiscal 2001. At August 31, 2002, we operated 3,068 domestic auto parts stores and 39 in Mexico, compared with 3,019 domestic auto parts stores, 21 in Mexico and 49 TruckPro stores at August 25, 2001. Excluding sales from the extra week in fiscal 2002, net sales increased 8.3% (see Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures). Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased approximately 9% during fiscal 2002, including an increase in retail same store sales of approximately 8% and an increase for commercial sales in same stores by approximately 17%. Comparable store sales increased in fiscal 2002 as a result of an increase in customer count and an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over the amounts in the 2001 fiscal year. New stores contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the increase during fiscal 2002; whereas, the overall sales increase was somewhat offset by the decrease in sales associated with TruckPro, which was sold in December 2001, of $47.6 million 21 Table of Contents in fiscal 2002 and $148.5 million in fiscal 2001. ALLDATA and Mexico sales composed the remainder of the increase in sales during fiscal 2002. Gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $2.375 billion, or 44.6 % of net sales, compared with $2.013 billion, or 41.8% of net sales for fiscal 2001. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2002 and the nonrecurring charges in fiscal 2001, gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $2.325 billion, or 44.6% of net sales, compared with $2.043 billion, or 42.4% of net sales for fiscal 2001 (see Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures). Gross margin improvement for fiscal 2002 reflected lower product costs, more efficient supply chain costs, reduced inventory shrinkage, the benefits of more strategic and disciplined pricing due to category management and the addition of more value added, high margin merchandise than in the 2001 fiscal year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002 increased by $105.5 million over such expenses for fiscal 2001 but declined as a percentage of net sales from 31.1% to 30.1%. The improved ratio reflected the fact that revenues rose more rapidly than the growth of store level expenses (a 1.1 percentage point improvement), combined with operating savings resulting from the restructuring in fiscal 2001 related to controlling staffing, base salaries and technology spending of 0.4 percentage points. Additionally, the 2001 fiscal year included other expenses related to strategic initiatives not included in the restructuring and impairment charges of 0.3 percentage points. The adoption of new accounting rules for goodwill reduced operating expenses in fiscal 2002 by approximately $8.6 million, or 0.2 percentage points. These improvements in the expense ratio were partially offset by additional bonus, legal, pension and insurance expenses incurred in the 2002 fiscal year of 1.1 percentage points. Net interest expense for fiscal 2002 was $79.9 million compared with $100.7 million during fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2002 was primarily due to lower levels of debt compared with the 2001 fiscal year and lower average borrowing rates. Weighted average borrowings for fiscal 2002 were $1.33 billion, compared with $1.45 billion for fiscal 2001. Additionally, weighted average borrowing rates, excluding the impact of debt amortization and facility fees, were lower in the 2002 year compared with the 2001 fiscal year at 4.4% compared with 6.2%. AutoZones effective income tax rate was 38.1% of pretax income for fiscal 2002 and 38.8% for fiscal 2001. The decrease in the tax rate is due primarily to the change in goodwill accounting. Net income for fiscal 2002 increased to $428.1 million from $175.5 and diluted earnings per share increased to $4.00 from $1.54 reported for fiscal 2001. Excluding the positive impact of the extra week in fiscal 2002 and the restructuring and impairment charges from fiscal 2001, comparable net income for fiscal 2002 increased to $409.9 million from $271.3 million for fiscal 2001; and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2002 increased to $3.83 from $2.38 for fiscal 2001 (see Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures). The impact of the fiscal 2002 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2002 was an increase of $0.16. 22 Table of Contents Inflation AutoZone does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation. We have been successful, in many cases, in mitigating the effects of merchandise cost increases principally through efficiencies gained through economies of scale, selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers. Seasonality and Quarterly Periods AutoZones business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring in the summer months of June through August, in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months of December through February. During short periods of time, a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States. Each of the first three quarters of AutoZones fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks (17 weeks in fiscal 2002). Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks (17 weeks in fiscal 2002), compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 represented 33.5% of annual net sales and 40.1% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, represented 34.6% of annual net sales and 41.6% of net income. Fiscal 2002 consisted of 53 weeks, with the fiscal fourth quarter including 17 weeks. Accordingly, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 included the benefit of an additional week of net sales of $109.1 million and net income of $18.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $698.3 million in fiscal 2003, $739.1 million in fiscal 2002 and $458.9 million in fiscal 2001. Cash flow generated from store operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. During the past three fiscal year periods, we have improved our accounts payable to inventory ratio to 87% at August 30, 2003, from 83% at August 31, 2002, and 76% at August 25, 2001. In each of the three year periods, the improvement in this ratio was a source of cash from operations, particularly in fiscal 2002 when the ratio increased 7 percentage points. The increase in merchandise inventories, required to support new store development and sales growth, has largely been financed by our vendors, as evidenced by the higher accounts payable to inventory ratio. 23 Table of Contents AutoZones primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program. From the beginning of fiscal 1999 to August 30, 2003, we have opened 562 net new domestic auto parts stores. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $167.8 million in fiscal 2003, compared with $64.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $122.1 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is due primarily to increased store development activities in the current year and proceeds from the sale of the TruckPro business in the prior year. We invested $182.2 million in capital assets in fiscal 2003 compared with $117.2 million in fiscal 2002 and $169.3 million in fiscal 2001. New store openings in the U.S. were 160 for fiscal 2003, 102 for fiscal 2002 and 107 for fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, we sold TruckPro, our heavy duty truck parts subsidiary, which operated 49 stores, for cash proceeds of $25.7 million. Proceeds from capital asset disposals totaled $14.4 million for fiscal 2003, $25.1 million for fiscal 2002 and $44.6 million for fiscal 2001. Net cash used in financing activities was $530.2 million in fiscal 2003, $675.4 million in fiscal 2002 and $336.5 million in fiscal 2001. The net cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock which totaled $891.1 million for fiscal 2003, $699.0 million for fiscal 2002 and $366.1 million for fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2003 net proceeds from the issuance of debt securities, including repayments on other debt and the net change in commercial paper borrowings, offset the increased level of treasury stock purchases by approximately $322 million. We expect to open approximately 195 new stores during fiscal 2004. Our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required by expansion. We believe that we will be able to continue to finance much of our inventory requirements through favorable payment terms from suppliers. Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance will be funded through borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past. Credit Ratings At August 30, 2003, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from Standard Poors of BBB and a commercial paper rating of A 2. Moodys Investors Service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2 and a commercial paper rating of P 2. As of August 30, 2003, both Moodys and Standard Poors had AutoZone listed as having a stable outlook. Subsequent to the 2003 fiscal year end, Moodys changed our outlook to negative, while confirming AutoZones existing credit ratings. If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will 24 Table of Contents increase, as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit. If our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become more limited. Debt Facilities We maintain $950 million of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks. Of the $950 million, $300 million expires in May 2004. The remaining $650 million expires in May 2005. The portion expiring in May 2004 includes a renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity date of the then outstanding debt by one year. The credit facilities exist largely to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured bank loans. At August 30, 2003, outstanding commercial paper of $268 million, the 6% Notes due November 2003 of $150 million and other debt of $2.7 million are classified as long term, as we have the ability and intention to refinance them on a long term basis. The rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the lending banks base rate (as defined in the agreement) or a competitive bid rate at our option. We have agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of our credit agreements, including limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens and minimum fixed charge coverage. As of August 30, 2003, we are in compliance with all covenants. On October 16, 2002, we issued $300 million of 5.875% Senior Notes. The notes mature in October 2012, and interest is payable semi annually on April 15 and October 15. A portion of the proceeds from these senior notes was used to prepay a $115 million unsecured bank term loan due December 2003, to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings, and to settle interest rate hedges associated with the issuance and repayment of the related debt securities. On June 3, 2003, we issued $200 million of 4.375% Senior Notes. These senior notes mature in June 2013, and interest is payable semi annually on June 1 and December 1. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings, to prepay $100 million of the $350 million unsecured bank loan due November 2004, and to settle interest rate hedges associated with the issuance of the debt securities. On August 8, 2003, we filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was declared effective on August 22, 2003. This filing will allow us to sell up to $500 million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt, and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. No debt had been issued under this registration statement as of August 30, 2003. All of the repayment obligations under our bank lines of credit may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if AutoZone experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements) of AutoZone or its Board of Directors or if covenants are breached related to total indebtedness and minimum fixed charge coverage. We expect to remain in compliance with these covenants. 25 Table of Contents Stock Repurchases As of August 30, 2003, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $3.3 billion of common stock in the open market. From January 1998 to August 30, 2003, approximately $2.8 billion of common stock had been repurchased. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased $891.1 million of common stock. At times in the past, we utilized equity forward agreements to facilitate our repurchase of common stock. There were no outstanding equity forward agreements for share repurchases as of August 30, 2003. At August 31, 2002, we held equity forward agreements, which were settled in cash during fiscal 2003, for the purchase of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $68.82 per share. Such obligations under equity forward agreements at August 31, 2002, were not reflected on our balance sheet. Financial Commitments The following table shows AutoZones obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations: Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Less than Between Between Over 5 (in thousands) Obligations 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years years Long term debt (1) $ 1,546,845 $ 420,700 $ 435,445 $ 190,700 $ 500,000 Operating leases (2) 671,103 118,269 197,311 129,446 226,077 Construction obligations 16,765 16,765 $ 2,234,713 $ 555,734 $ 632,756 $ 320,146 $ 726,077 (1) Long term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. At August 30, 2003, debt balances due in less than one year of $420.7 million are classified as long term in our Consolidated Financial Statements, as we have the ability and intention to refinance them on a long term basis. (2) Operating lease obligations include related interest. The following table shows AutoZones other commitments which all have expiration periods of less than one year: Total Other (in thousands) Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 52,778 Surety bonds 8,123 $ 60,901 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The above table reflects the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 30, 2003. A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily 26 Table of Contents renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet. The letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements have automatic renewal clauses. In conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some of our commercial customers. The receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. AutoZone has recorded a reserve for this recourse. At August 30, 2003, the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of $42.1 million and the balance of the recourse reserve was $2.6 million. Guarantee and Indemnification Arrangements During fiscal 2003, AutoZone adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). Effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002, FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures that must be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and indemnities. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by AutoZone after December 31, 2002, if these arrangements are within the scope of FIN 45. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a significant impact on AutoZones Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Product Warranties Limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties are provided to our customers by AutoZone or the vendors supplying its products. Warranty costs relating to merchandise sold under warranty not covered by vendors are estimated and recorded as warranty obligations at the time of sale based on each products historical return rate. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as necessary. Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities We have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business, such as employment matters, product liability, general liability related to our store premises and alleged violation of the Robinson Patman Act (as specifically described in Note M in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Generally, we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities, such as lawsuits and our retained liability for insured claims. 27 Table of Contents Vendor Allowances AutoZone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based on the volume of purchases or for services that AutoZone provides to the vendors. Monies received from vendors include rebates, allowances and promotional funds. Typically these funds are dependent on purchase volumes and advertising plans. The amounts to be received are subject to changes in market conditions, vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell through of the related merchandise for AutoZone. Rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales. These monies are treated as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold. Certain vendor allowances are used exclusively for promotions and to partially or fully offset certain other direct expenses. Such vendor funding arrangements, that were entered into on or before December 31, 2002, were recognized as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses when earned. However, for such vendor funding arrangements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002, AutoZone applied the new guidance pursuant to the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor (EITF Issue No. 02 16). Accordingly, all such vendor funds are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold. The new accounting pronouncement for vendor funding does not impact the way AutoZone runs its business or its relationships with vendors. It does, however, require the deferral of certain vendor funding which is calculated based upon vendor inventory turns. Based on the timing of the issuance of the pronouncement and guidelines, we were precluded from adopting EITF Issue No. 02 16 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Our timing and accounting treatment of EITF Issue No. 02 16 was not discretionary. Impairments In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets, such as property and equipment, covered by this standard whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. We compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists. We perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments. If impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations, the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment 28 Table of Contents loss. Such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed, which could differ from actual results. Restructuring and Impairment Charges In fiscal 2001, AutoZone recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $156.8 million, including restructuring accruals of $29.6 million. The accrued obligations for restructuring charges totaled approximately $12.5 million at August 30, 2003, and $18.1 million at August 31, 2002. The original charges and activity in the restructuring accruals is described more fully in Note L in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2002, we reevaluated remaining excess properties related to the fiscal 2001 impairment charges and determined that several properties could be developed. This resulted in the reversal of accrued lease obligations totaling $6.4 million. We also determined that additional writedowns of $9.0 million were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair value. In addition, we recognized $2.6 million of gains in fiscal 2002 as a result of closing certain stores associated with the restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2003, AutoZone recognized $4.6 million of gains as a result of the disposition of properties associated with the restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2001. Included in the fiscal 2001 impairment and restructure charges were asset writedowns and contractual obligations aggregating $29.9 million related to the planned sale of TruckPro, our heavy duty truck parts subsidiary. In December 2001, TruckPro was sold to a group of investors for cash proceeds of $25.7 million and a promissory note. A deferred gain of $3.6 million was recorded as part of the sale due to uncertainties associated with the realization of the gain. During fiscal 2003, the note was paid and certain liabilities were settled. As a result, a total pre tax gain of $4.7 million was recognized in income during fiscal 2003 as part of operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. No other significant gains or charges are anticipated under the fiscal 2001 restructuring plan. Value of Pension Assets At August 30, 2003, the fair market value of AutoZones pension assets was $86.7 million, and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $136.1 million. On January 1, 2003, our defined benefit pension plans were frozen. Accordingly, plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas, and no new participants may join the plans. The material assumptions for fiscal 2003 are an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8% and a discount rate of 6%. For additional information regarding AutoZones qualified and non qualified pension plans refer to Note J in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which a company absorbs a majority of another entitys expected losses or residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the other entity. These entities are called variable interest entities. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied at the end of periods ending after December 15, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 and does not expect its adoption to have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Risk Factors We may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates. We have increased our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 2,657 stores at August 29, 1998, to 3,219 stores at August 30, 2003, an average store count increase per year of 4%. In addition, a portion of our total sales increases each year resulted from increases in sales at existing stores. We cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores at historical rates or increase same store sales. Our business depends upon qualified employees. At the end of fiscal 2003, our consolidated employee count was approximately 49,000. We can not assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates. If we do not maintain competitive wages, our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or, alternatively, our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates. If demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially affected. Demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors. In the short term, it may depend upon: the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors. 30 Table of Contents the number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old and older, as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles. the weather, as vehicle maintenance may be disrupted due to catastrophic weather conditions impacting a wide geographic area. the economy. In periods of rapidly declining economic conditions, both DIY and DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair. During periods of expansionary economic conditions, more of our DIY customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles. For the long term, demand for our products may depend upon: the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles. restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation. If we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline. The sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas, including name recognition, product availability, customer service, store location and price. AutoZone competes in both the retail (DIY) and commercial (DIFM) auto parts and accessories markets. Competitors include national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners, merchandise quality, selection and availability, product warranty, store layout, location and convenience, and the strength of our AutoZone brand name, trademarks and service marks, some competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater financial and marketing resources, larger stores with more merchandise, longer operating histories, more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising. If we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies, or if our competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline. If we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto parts business, our sales growth may be limited. Although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial DIFM market, to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket jobbers and 31 Table of Contents warehouse distributors, in addition to other auto parts retailers that have entered the commercial business. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, merchandise quality, selection and availability, and distribution locations, some automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have, have developed long term customer relationships and have larger available inventories. We can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers. If our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for our merchandise. Recently, several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge. Further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products. Consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business. Recently, several large auto parts chains have merged. We do not know the impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket. If our competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers, then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are stronger. War or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales. War, or acts of terrorism or the threat of either, may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected. In the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores. 32 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures Selected Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include the following financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The following non GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value. After Tax Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Cash Flow Before Share Repurchases In addition, the impact of certain non recurring or infrequent items, that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, was excluded in the determination of certain financial measures presented in Selected Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe that the resulting non GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because these measures indicate more clearly our comparative year to year operating results. The following non recurring or infrequent items were all identified as adjustments for comparative purposes: For fiscal 2003, a $4.6 million pre tax gain as a result of the disposition of properties associated with the fiscal 2001 restructuring and impairment charges For fiscal 2003, a $10.0 million pre tax negative impact and reclassification of certain vendor funding to increase operating expenses by $53 million and decrease cost of goods sold by $43 million, both as a result of the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 16 regarding vendor funding For fiscal 2003, a $4.7 million pre tax gain associated with the settlement of certain liabilities and the repayment of a note associated with the fiscal 2002 sale of the TruckPro business For fiscal 2002, the favorable impact of the additional week of the 53 week fiscal year For fiscal 2001, a $156.8 million pre tax restructuring and impairment charge Non GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information to analyze or compare our operations. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors use the abovementioned non GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables. 33 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measure: After Tax Return on Invested Capital The following table reconciles the percentages of after tax return on invested capital, or ROIC, both including and excluding the fiscal 2001 restructuring and impairment charges, to net income. After tax return on invested capital is calculated as after tax operating profit (excluding rent) divided by average invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases).

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk AutoZone is exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we use various financial instruments to reduce such risks. To date, based upon our current level of foreign operations, hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates, no instruments have been utilized to reduce this market risk. All of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our Board of Directors. Further, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk AutoZones financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps. AutoZone has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. At August 30, 2003, we held an interest rate swap contract, with a September 2003 maturity date, to hedge $25 million of variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings. At August 30, 2003, we also held treasury lock agreements with notional amounts of $300 million and forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $200 million. These agreements, which expire in November 2003, are used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates relating to anticipated debt transactions. It is expected that upon settlement of the agreements, the realized gain or loss will be deferred in other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. In addition, during fiscal 2003, we entered into and settled a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200 million, used to hedge the variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to AutoZones issuance of $200 million 4.375% Senior Notes. The loss realized upon settlement was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying senior notes, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.65%. At August 31, 2002, we held interest rate swap contracts related to $190 million of variable rate debt. Of the $190 million, $115 million of the swaps, due in December 2003, were used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with AutoZones $115 million term loan. The remaining $75 million of swaps, with expiration dates throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004, were designated to hedge the variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings. Additionally, at August 31, 2002, we held treasury lock agreements with notional amounts of $300 million that expired in October 2002 and hedged the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to AutoZones issuance of $300 million 5.875% Senior Notes. The loss realized upon settlement was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying senior notes, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6.33%. A portion of the proceeds generated 39 Table of Contents from the issuance of the senior notes was used to prepay a $115 million term loan. Accordingly, the related interest rate swap agreements were settled in cash and the realized loss was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying term loan. AutoZone reflects the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments on our balance sheet. The related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related interest rates being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the interest rate being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. For the years ended August 30, 2003, and August 31, 2002, all of our hedge instruments were determined to be highly effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in income. The fair values of the interest rate hedge instruments at August 30, 2003, were an asset of $41.6 million. The fair values of the interest rate hedge instruments at August 31, 2002, were a liability of $10.4 million. The fair value of AutoZones debt was estimated at $1.57 billion as of August 30, 2003, and $1.22 billion as of August 31, 2002, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to AutoZone for debt of the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt at August 30, 2003, by $27.3 million, and greater than the carrying value of debt at August 31, 2002, by $27.2 million. We had $556.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 30, 2003, and $699.8 million outstanding at August 31, 2002, both of which exclude the effect of interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges of such variable rate debt. At these borrowing levels for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on AutoZones pretax earnings and cash flows of $5.3 million in 2003 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2002, which includes the effects of interest rate swaps. The primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR. We had $990.0 million of fixed rate debt outstanding at August 30, 2003. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of AutoZones fixed rate debt of $47.0 million. Fuel Price Risk Fuel swap contracts utilized by AutoZone have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of SFAS 133 and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, although the instruments were executed to economically hedge the consumption of diesel fuel used to distribute our products. Accordingly, mark to market gains and losses related to such fuel swap contracts are recorded in cost of sales as a component of distribution costs. As of August 30, 2003, no fuel swap contracts were outstanding. During fiscal 2003, we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure between April and August 2003. These swaps were settled prior to August 30, 2003, and had no significant impact on cost of sales for fiscal year 2003. 40 Table of Contents
