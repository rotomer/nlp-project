Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are the nations leading specialty retailer and a leading distributor of automotive parts and accessories, with most of our sales to do it yourself (DIY) customers. We began operations in 1979 and as of August 25, 2007, operated 3,933 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 123 in Mexico. Each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products. In many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software. On the web, we sell diagnostic and repair information and automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non automotive products through www.autozone.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation. Results of Operations Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006 For the year ended August 25, 2007, AutoZone reported net sales of $6.170 billion compared with $5.948 billion for the year ended August 26, 2006, a 3.7% increase from fiscal 2006. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores. At August 25, 2007, we operated 3,933 domestic stores and 123 in Mexico, compared with 3,771 domestic stores and 100 in Mexico at August 26, 2006. Domestic retail sales increased 3.4% and domestic commercial sales decreased 0.4% from prior year. ALLDATA and Mexico sales increased over prior year, contributing 0.9 percentage points of the total increase in net sales. Domestic same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased 0.1% from the prior year. Gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $3.064 billion, or 49.7% of net sales, compared with $2.939 billion, or 49.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2006. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives and supply chain efficiencies. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 increased to $2.009 billion, or 32.6% of net sales, from $1.929 billion, or 32.4% of net sales for fiscal 2006. The increase in expenses is driven primarily by higher occupancy cost versus the prior year. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2007 was $119.1 million compared with $107.9 million during fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to higher short term rates and higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the recognition of interest expense on capital lease obligations that were accounted for as operating leases prior to a modification to the lease agreements in fiscal 2007. Average borrowings for fiscal 2007 were $1.972 billion, compared with $1.928 billion for fiscal 2006. Weighted average borrowing rates were 5.7% at August 25, 2007, compared to 5.5% at August 26, 2006. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.4% of pre tax income for fiscal 2007 as compared to 36.9% for fiscal 2006 primarily due to benefits from changes in our pre tax earnings mix and an increase in certain federal and state tax credits. Refer to "Note D Income Taxes" for additional information regarding our income tax rate. Net income for fiscal 2007 increased by 4.6% to $595.7 million, and diluted earnings per share increased by 13.6% to $8.53 from $7.50 in fiscal 2006. The impact of the fiscal 2007 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 was an increase of approximately $0.14. 18 Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005 For the year ended August 26, 2006, AutoZone reported sales of $5.948 billion compared with $5.711 billion for the year ended August 27, 2005, a 4.2% increase from fiscal 2005. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores. At August 26, 2006, we operated 3,771 domestic stores and 100 in Mexico, compared with 3,592 domestic stores and 81 in Mexico at August 27, 2005. Domestic Retail sales increased 4.0% and domestic commercial sales decreased 1.3% from prior year. ALLDATA and Mexico sales increased over prior year, contributing 0.9 percentage points of the total increase. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased 0.4% from the prior year. Gross profit for fiscal 2006 was $2.939 billion, or 49.4% of net sales, compared with $2.793 billion, or 48.9% of net sales, for fiscal 2005. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives, partially off set by increases in certain commodity costs. Our ongoing category management initiatives have included continued optimization of merchandise assortment and pricing, management of procurement costs, and an increasing focus on direct importing initiatives. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 increased to $1.929 billion, or 32.4% of net sales, from $1.817 billion, or 31.8% of net sales for fiscal 2005. Expenses for fiscal 2005 include a $40.3 million charge related to accounting for leases (see Note J Leases). Expenses for fiscal 2006 include $17.4 million in share based compensation expense resulting from the current year adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (see Note B Share Based Payments). The remaining increase in expenses is driven by initiatives to improve the customers shopping experience and higher occupancy costs driven largely by the opening of new stores. These initiatives continue to include expanded hours of operation, enhanced training programs and ensuring clean, well merchandised stores. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2006 was $107.9 million compared with $102.4 million during fiscal 2005. This increase was due to a higher average borrowing rate, partially offset by lower average borrowing levels. Average borrowings for fiscal 2006 were $1.928 billion, compared with $1.970 billion for fiscal 2005. Weighted average borrowing rates were 5.5% at August 26, 2006, compared to 5.2% at August 27, 2005. The increase in interest rates reflects both the ongoing effort to extend the terms of our borrowings, as well as the impact from increased short term rates. Our effective income tax rate increased to 36.9% of pre tax income for fiscal 2006 as compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 effective income tax rate reflects $21.3 million in tax benefits related to the repatriation of Mexican earnings as a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (see Note D Income Taxes), and other discrete income tax items. Net income for fiscal 2006 decreased by 0.3% to $569.3 million, and diluted earnings per share increased by 4.5% to $7.50 from $7.18 in fiscal 2005. The impact of the fiscal 2006 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 was an increase of approximately $0.09. Seasonality and Quarterly Periods AutoZones business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months of March through August, in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months of December through February. During short periods of time, a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States and Mexico. Each of the first three quarters of AutoZones fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks. Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 represented 32.5% of annual sales and 36.5% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 represented 32.6% of annual sales and 37.5% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 represented 33.0% of annual sales and 36.2% of net income. 19 Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $845.2 million in fiscal 2007, $822.7 million in fiscal 2006, and $648.1 million in fiscal 2005. The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories. Our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. During the past three fiscal years, we have maintained an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 93% at August 25, 2007, 92% at August 26, 2006, and 93% at August 27, 2005. The increase in merchandise inventories, required to support new store development and sales growth, has largely been financed by our vendors, as evidenced by our accounts payable to inventory ratio. Contributing to this ratio is the use of pay on scan (POS) arrangements with certain vendors. Under a POS arrangement, AutoZone will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until that merchandise is ultimately sold to AutoZones customers. Upon the sale of the merchandise to AutoZones customers, AutoZone recognizes the liability for the goods and pays the vendor in accordance with the agreed upon terms. Revenues under POS arrangements are included in net sales in the income statement. Since we do not own merchandise under POS arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer, such merchandise is not included in our balance sheet. Merchandise under POS arrangements was $22.4 million at August 25, 2007. AutoZones primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program. From the beginning of fiscal 2005 to August 25, 2007, we have opened 573 net new stores. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $228.7 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $268.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $282.8 million in fiscal 2005. We invested $224.5 million in capital assets in fiscal 2007, compared to $263.6 million in capital assets in fiscal 2006 and $283.5 million in fiscal 2005. New store openings were 186 for fiscal 2007, 204 for fiscal 2006, and 193 for fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we began investing a portion of our assets held by the Companys wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities. We acquired $94.6 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2007 and acquired $160.0 million in fiscal 2006. We had proceeds from matured marketable securities of $86.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $145.4 million in fiscal 2006. Capital asset disposals provided $3.5 million in fiscal 2007, $9.8 million in fiscal 2006, and $3.8 million for fiscal 2005. Net cash used in financing activities was $621.4 million in fiscal 2007, $537.7 million in fiscal 2006, and $367.4 million in fiscal 2005. The net cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock which totaled $761.9 million for fiscal 2007, $578.1 million for fiscal 2006, and $426.9 million for fiscal 2005. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations, and at times, by increases in debt levels. We expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2008, primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and systems. In addition to the building and land costs, our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required. We believe that we will be able to continue to finance much of our inventory requirements through favorable payment terms from suppliers. Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past. Credit Ratings At August 25, 2007, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from Standard & Poors of BBB+ and a commercial paper rating of A 2. Moodys Investors Service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2 and a commercial paper rating of P 2. As of August 25, 2007, Moodys and Standard & Poors had AutoZone listed as having a stable outlook. If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will increase, as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit. If our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become more limited. 20 Debt Facilities We maintain $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks to primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short term unsecured bank loans. These facilities expire in May 2010, may be increased to $1.3 billion at AutoZones election, may include up to $200 million in letters of credit, and may include up to $100 million in capital leases. As the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit, the Company had $680.2 million in available capacity under these facilities at August 25, 2007. The rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of Bank of Americas base rate or a Eurodollar rate (each as defined in the facility agreements), or a combination thereof. Our $300.0 million bank term loan entered in December 2004 was amended in April 2006 to have similar terms and conditions as the $1.0 billion credit facilities, but with a December 2009 maturity, and was further amended in August 2007 to reduce the interest rate on Euro dollar loans. That credit agreement with a group of banks provides for a term loan, which consists of, at our election, base rate loans, Eurodollar loans or a combination thereof. The interest accrues on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage, which can range from 30 basis points to 90 basis points, depending upon our senior unsecured (non credit enhanced) long term debt rating. Based on our ratings at August 25, 2007, the applicable percentage on Eurodollar loans is 35 basis points. We may select interest periods of one, two, three or six months for Eurodollar loans, subject to availability. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on December 29, 2004, to effectively fix, based on current debt ratings, the interest rate of the term loan at 4.4%. We have the option to extend loans into subsequent interest period(s) or convert them into loans of another interest rate type. The entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan will be due and payable in full on December 23, 2009, when the facility terminates. We may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar borrowings. During April 2006, our $150.0 million Senior Notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper. On June 8, 2006, we issued $200.0 million in 6.95% Senior Notes due 2016 under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 17, 2004. That shelf registration allowed us to sell up to $300 million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt, and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. The remainder of the shelf registration was cancelled in February, 2007. Our borrowings under our Senior Notes arrangements contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. Under our other borrowing arrangements, covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a provision where repayment obligations may be accelerated if AutoZone experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements). All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. As of August 25, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants. Stock Repurchases During 1998, the Company announced a program permitting the Company to repurchase a portion of its outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by the Companys Board of Directors. The program was most recently amended in June 2007 to increase the repurchase authorization to $5.9 billion from $5.4 billion. From January 1998 to August 25, 2007, the Company has repurchased a total of 99.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $5.4 billion. The Company repurchased 6.0 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $761.9 million during fiscal 2007, 6.2 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $578.1 million during fiscal 2006, and 4.8 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $426.9 million during fiscal 2005. 21 Financial Commitments The following table shows AutoZones significant contractual obligations as of August 25, 2007: Total Payment Due by Period Contractual Less than Between Between Over 5 (in thousands) Obligations 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years years Long term debt (1) $ 1,935,618 $ 435,618 $ 300,000 $ 200,000 $ 1,000,000 Interest payments (2) 500,707 96,988 154,506 118,300 130,913 Operating leases (3) 1,312,252 171,163 291,970 214,984 634,135 Capital leases (4) 62,510 16,015 28,928 17,567 Self insurance reserves (5) 141,815 45,727 45,283 22,415 28,390 Construction obligations 23,804 23,804 $ 3,976,706 $ 789,315 $ 820,687 $ 573,266 $ 1,793,438 (1) Long term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. At August 25, 2007, debt balances due in less than one year of $435.6 million are classified as long term in our consolidated financial statements, as we have the ability and intent to refinance them on a long term basis. (2) Represents obligations for interest payments on long term debt, including the effect of interest rate hedges. (3) Operating lease obligations include related interest and are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. (4) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (5) The Company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general and product liability, property, and automotive insurance. These amounts represent undiscounted estimates based on actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities , the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns. Accordingly, the Company reflects the net present value of these obligations in its consolidated balance sheets. We have other obligations reflected in our balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities or due to the nature of the account. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2008 that are included in current liabilities. We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These contingent liabilities are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 25, 2007. (in thousands) Total Other Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 113,305 Surety bonds 11,286 $ 124,591 A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses. In conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some of our commercial customers. The majority of our receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. AutoZone has recorded a reserve for this recourse. At August 25, 2007, the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of $55.3 million and the balance of the recourse reserve was $1.8 million. 22 We have entered into POS arrangements with certain vendors, whereby we will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until just before that merchandise is ultimately sold to our customers. Title and certain risks of ownership remain with the vendor until the merchandise is sold to our customers. Since we do not own merchandise under POS arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer, such merchandise is not recorded on our balance sheet. Upon the sale of the merchandise to our customers, we recognize the liability for the goods and pay the vendor in accordance with the agreed upon terms. Although we do not hold title to the goods, we do control pricing and have credit collection risk and therefore, gross revenues under POS arrangements are included in net sales in the income statement. Sales of merchandise under POS arrangements approximated $170.0 million in fiscal 2007, $390.0 million in fiscal 2006, and $460.0 million in fiscal 2005. Merchandise under POS arrangements was $22.4 million at August 25, 2007 and $92.1 million at August 26, 2006. Value of Pension Assets At August 25, 2007, the fair market value of AutoZones pension assets was $161.2 million, and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $161.1 million based on a May 31, 2007 measurement date. On January 1, 2003, our defined benefit pension plans were frozen. Accordingly, plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas, and no new participants may join the plans. The material assumptions for fiscal 2007 are an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0% and a discount rate of 6.25%. For additional information regarding AutoZones qualified and non qualified pension plans refer to Note I Pensions and Savings Plans in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures Selected Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value. Non GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information to analyze or compare our operations. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors use the abovementioned non GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following reconciliation tables. Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measure: Cash Flow Before Share Repurchases and Changes in Debt The following table reconciles net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents to cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt, which is presented in the Selected Financial Data. Fiscal Year Ended August (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (4,904 ) $ 16,748 $ (2,042 ) $ (16,250 ) $ 22,796 Less: Increase (decrease) in debt 78,461 (4,693 ) (7,400 ) 322,405 352,328 Less: Share repurchases (761,887 ) (578,066 ) (426,852 ) (848,102 ) (891,095 ) Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt $ 678,522 $ 599,507 $ 432,210 $ 509,447 $ 561,563 23 Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measure: After Tax Return on Invested Capital The following table reconciles the percentages of after tax return on invested capital, or ROIC. After tax return on invested capital is calculated as after tax operating profit (excluding rent) divided by average invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). The ROIC percentages are presented in the Selected Financial Data. (in thousands, except percentage data) Fiscal Year Ended August 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 595,672 $ 569,275 $ 571,019 $ 566,202 $ 517,604 Adjustments: After tax interest 75,793 68,089 65,533 58,003 52,686 After tax rent 97,050 90,808 96,367 73,086 68,764 After tax return $ 768,515 $ 728,172 $ 732,919 $ 697,291 $ 639,054 Average debt (1) $ 1,955,652 $ 1,909,011 $ 1,969,639 $ 1,787,307 $ 1,484,987 Average equity (2) 478,853 510,657 316,639 292,802 580,176 Rent x 6 (3) 915,138 863,328 774,706 701,621 663,990 Average capital lease obligations (4) 30,538 Pre tax invested capital $ 3,380,181 $ 3,282,996 $ 3,060,984 $ 2,781,730 $ 2,729,153 ROIC 22.7 % 22.2 % 23.9 % 25.1 % 23.4 % (1) Average debt is equal to the average of our long term debt measured at the end of the prior fiscal year and each of the 13 fiscal periods in the current fiscal year. Long term debt (in thousands) was $1,194,517 at August 31, 2002. (2) Average equity is equal to the average of our stockholders equity measured at the end of the prior fiscal year and each of the 13 fiscal periods of the current fiscal year. Stockholders equity (in thousands) was $689,127 at August 31, 2002. (3) Rent is multiplied by a factor of six to capitalize operating leases in the determination of pre tax invested capital. This calculation excludes the impact from the cumulative lease accounting adjustments recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. (4) Average of the capital lease obligations relating to vehicle capital leases entered into at the beginning of fiscal 2007 is computed as the average over the trailing 13 periods. Rent expense associated with the vehicles prior to the conversion to capital leases is included in the rent for purposes of calculating return on invested capital. 24 Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) in June 2006. The interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 26, 2007. The Company has not determined the effect, if any, that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This new standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective for AutoZone in fiscal 2009. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 157 will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations. On September 29, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R ("SFAS 158"). This new standard requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status; (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. Those changes will be reported in comprehensive income. We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 during 2007 and will adopt the measurement date provisions in 2009. Please refer to Note I (Pension and Savings Plan) for further description of this adoption. In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). This new standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 will be effective for AutoZone in fiscal 2009. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, that it will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and Cost of Sales We state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Included in inventory are related purchasing, storage and handling costs. Due to price deflation on the Companys merchandise purchases, the Companys inventory balances are effectively maintained under the first in, first out method as the Companys policy is not to write up inventory for favorable LIFO adjustments, resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the higher amount. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. The nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit. We provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs. Additionally, we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrinkage. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. 25 Vendor Allowances AutoZone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based on the volume of purchases or for services that AutoZone provides to the vendors. Monies received from vendors include rebates, allowances and promotional funds. The amounts to be received are subject to purchase volumes and the terms of the vendor agreements, which generally do not state an expiration date, but are subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in market conditions, vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell through of the related merchandise. The Companys level of advertising and other operating, selling, general and administrative expenditures are not dependent on vendor allowances. Rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product, but only if it is reasonably certain that the required volume levels will be reached. These monies are recorded as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold. For all allowances and promotional funds earned under vendor funding, the Company applies the guidance pursuant to the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor (EITF 02 16), by recording the vendor funds as a reduction of inventories that are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold. The Companys vendor funding arrangements do not provide for any reimbursement arrangements that are for specific, incremental, identifiable costs that are permitted under EITF 02 16 for the funding to be recorded as a reduction to advertising or other operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Impairments In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets, such as property and equipment, covered by this standard annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. We compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists. We perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments. If impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations, the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment loss. Such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed, which could differ from actual results. Self Insurance We retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, vehicle, employee health, general and product liability and property losses. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. Through various methods, which include analyses of historical trends and utilization of actuaries, the Company estimates the costs of these risks. The actuarial estimated long term portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities are not discounted. We believe the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. We maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Income Taxes We accrue and pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax matters in dispute with state, federal and foreign tax authorities. Management believes the resolution of the current open tax issues will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 26 Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities We have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business, such as employment matters, product liability claims and general liability claims related to our store premises. We calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities. Pension Obligation Prior to January 1, 2003, substantially all full time employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive five year average compensation. On January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. On January 1, 2003, the Companys supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. As the plan benefits are frozen, the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels, but are impacted by actuarial calculations using two key assumptions: i. Expected long term rate of return on plan assets: estimated by considering the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. ii. Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations: adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date (May 31) using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. This same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year. If such assumptions differ materially from actual experience, the impact could be material to our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk AutoZone is exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks. To date, based upon our current level of foreign operations, hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates, no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our Board of Directors. Further, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk AutoZones financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps. AutoZone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. We reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets. All of the Companys interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. We had an outstanding interest rate swap with a fair value of $5.8 million at August 25, 2007, and $10.2 million at August 26, 2006, to effectively fix the interest rate on the $300.0 million term loan entered into during December 2004. The related gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. The Companys hedge instrument was determined to be highly effective as of August 25, 2007. 27 The fair value of our debt was estimated at $1.928 billion as of August 25, 2007, and $1.825 billion as of August 26, 2006, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to AutoZone for debt having the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by $7.6 million at August 25, 2007, and less than the carrying value of debt by $32.3 million at August 26, 2006. Considering the effect of any interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges, we had $245.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 25, 2007, and $167.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 26, 2006. At these borrowing levels for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of $2.5 million in 2007 and $1.7 million in 2006, which includes the effects of interest rate swaps. The primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR. Considering the effect of any interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges, we had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.690 billion at August 25, 2007, and at August 26, 2006. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by $60.8 million at August 25, 2007, and $68.3 million at August 26, 2006. Fuel Price Risk Fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of SFAS 133 and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel and unleaded fuel exposure. As of August 25, 2007, the then current months fuel swap contract was outstanding with a settlement date of August 31, 2007. During fiscal 2007 and 2005, we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure. These swaps were settled within a few days of each fiscal year end and had no significant impact on cost of sales for the 2007 or 2005 fiscal years. We did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2006. 28
