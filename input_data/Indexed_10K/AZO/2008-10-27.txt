Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are the nations leading specialty retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories. We began operations in 1979 and at August 30, 2008, operated 4,092 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 148 in Mexico. Each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products. In many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software. On the web, we sell diagnostic and repair information and automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products through www.autozone.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation. Executive Summary AutoZone achieved a solid performance in fiscal 2008 delivering record earnings of $642 million and sales growth of $353 million over the prior year. We completed the fiscal year with solid growth in our commercial sales and an increase in our retail sales. We are encouraged by the increase in our commercial business and remain focused on strengthening our retail business. We believe the challenging macro environment, including increases in gas prices, the credit crisis and higher unemployment, has impacted our customers. Based on the current macro environment, we continue to communicate to our customers our extensive product categories that are focused on improving gas mileage and saving money by performing maintenance on their vehicles. We believe the two statistics that have the closest correlation to our market growth are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. Miles driven declined for the ninth straight month in July 2008. August data is not yet available. We believe higher gas prices have contributed to these trends. Conversely, the number of older vehicles (seven years old or older) on the road has continued to increase annually. We currently do not believe the combined impact of these trends to be material to our business. Key Initiatives During fiscal 2008, we continued to reinforce the importance of improving the customer shopping experience by focusing on continuous training on product knowledge, leadership and most importantly, our culture of customer satisfaction. Additionally, we made steady progress on our category management initiatives by making enhancements to our merchandise assortment planning tools, updating category line reviews, expanding our parts assortment, and increasing retail prices to help mitigate the exposure to our business from increased costs. Also, we maintained our focus on Commercial sales training to develop a first class Commercial field sales organization. Lastly, we continued to gain traction on our new electronic parts catalogue, Z net, by improving its capabilities and highlighting this customer service enhancement in our marketing campaign. We continue to see our customers being more cautious with their buying habits in the midst of a challenging environment; however, we believe we are well positioned moving into fiscal 2009 and are confident we can continue offering a value proposition that is compelling to our customers. Results of Operations Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007 For the year ended August 30, 2008, AutoZone reported net sales of $6.523 billion compared with $6.170 billion for the year ended August 25, 2007, a 5.7% increase from fiscal 2007. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores, a 1.9% increase from the addition of the 53rd week and domestic same store sales increase of 0.4%. At August 30, 2008, we operated 4,092 domestic stores and 148 in Mexico, compared with 3,933 domestic stores and 123 in Mexico at August 25, 2007. Domestic retail sales increased 4.5% and domestic commercial sales increased 6.8% from prior year. ALLDATA and Mexico sales increased over prior year, contributing 1.2 percentage points of the total increase in net sales. 19 Table of Contents Gross profit for fiscal 2008 was $3.268 billion, or 50.1% of net sales, compared with $3.064 billion, or 49.7% of net sales, for fiscal 2007. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales was due to the positive impact of category management efforts, partially offset by increased distribution expense relating to higher fuel costs. Vendor funding is primarily recorded as a reduction to inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold; however, vendor funding for specific selling activities is recorded as a reduction to operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Historically, we have classified the majority of our funding as a reduction to inventory; however, during the current year we began to transition to more specific promotions and selling activities as we increased our efforts with vendors to develop tactics to allow them to drive sales and showcase their product, which affect selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 increased to $2.144 billion, or 32.9% of net sales, from $2.009 billion, or 32.6% of net sales for fiscal 2007. The increase of operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to higher employee medical expense and fuel expense for our commercial fleet. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2008 was $116.7 million compared with $119.1 million during fiscal 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower short term rates and was offset by higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the impact of the additional week in the current fiscal year. Average borrowings for fiscal 2008 were $2.024 billion, compared with $1.972 billion for fiscal 2007. Weighted average borrowing rates were 5.2% at August 30, 2008, compared to 5.7% at August 25, 2007. Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% of pre tax income for fiscal 2008 compared to 36.4% for fiscal 2007. Refer to Note D Income Taxes for additional information regarding our income tax rate. Net income for fiscal 2008 increased by 7.7% to $641.6 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 17.8% to $10.04 from $8.53 in fiscal 2007. The impact of the fiscal 2008 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008 was an increase of approximately $0.29. Excluding the additional week, net income for the year increased 5.1% over the previous year to $625.8 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 14.9% to $9.80 per share. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006 For the year ended August 25, 2007, AutoZone reported net sales of $6.170 billion compared with $5.948 billion for the year ended August 26, 2006, a 3.7% increase from fiscal 2006. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores. At August 25, 2007, we operated 3,933 domestic stores and 123 in Mexico, compared with 3,771 domestic stores and 100 in Mexico at August 26, 2006. Domestic retail sales increased 3.4% and domestic commercial sales decreased 0.4% from prior year. ALLDATA and Mexico sales increased over prior year, contributing 0.9 percentage points of the total increase in net sales. Domestic same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased 0.1% from the prior year. Gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $3.064 billion, or 49.7% of net sales, compared with $2.939 billion, or 49.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2006. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives and supply chain efficiencies. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 increased to $2.009 billion, or 32.6% of net sales, from $1.929 billion, or 32.4% of net sales for fiscal 2006. The increase in expenses is driven primarily by higher occupancy cost versus the prior year. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2007 was $119.1 million compared with $107.9 million during fiscal 2006. This increase was due to higher short term rates and higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the recognition of interest expense on capital lease obligations that were accounted for as operating leases prior to a modification to the lease agreements in fiscal 2007. Average borrowings for fiscal 2007 were $1.972 billion, compared with $1.928 billion for fiscal 2006. Weighted average borrowing rates were 5.7% at August 25, 2007, compared to 5.5% at August 26, 2006. 20 Table of Contents Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.4% of pre tax income for fiscal 2007 as compared to 36.9% for fiscal 2006 primarily due to benefits from changes in our pre tax earnings mix and an increase in certain federal and state tax credits. Refer to Note D Income Taxes for additional information regarding our income tax rate. Net income for fiscal 2007 increased 4.6% to $595.7 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 13.6% to $8.53 from $7.50 in fiscal 2006. The impact of the fiscal 2007 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 was an increase of approximately $0.14. Seasonality and Quarterly Periods AutoZones business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months of March through September, in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months of December through February. During short periods of time, a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States and Mexico. Each of the first three quarters of AutoZones fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks in 2008 and 16 weeks in 2007 and 2006. Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, containing 17 weeks, represented 33.9% of annual sales and 38.0% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, containing 16 weeks, represented 32.5% of annual sales and 36.5% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, containing 16 weeks, represented 32.6% of annual sales and 37.5% of net income. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories. Net cash provided by operating activities was $921.1 million in fiscal 2008, $845.2 million in fiscal 2007, and $822.7 million in fiscal 2006. The increase over prior year was primarily due to the growth in net income and to a lesser extent, timing of income tax deductions, and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors continue to finance a large portion of our inventory. Partially offsetting this increase was higher accounts receivable. We have maintained an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 95% at August 30, 2008, 93% at August 25, 2007, and 92% at August 26, 2006. AutoZones primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program. From the beginning of fiscal 2006 to August 30, 2008, we have opened 567 net new stores. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $243.2 million in fiscal 2008, compared to $228.7 million in fiscal 2007, and $268.3 million in fiscal 2006. We invested $243.6 million in capital assets in fiscal 2008, compared to $224.5 million in capital assets in fiscal 2007, and $263.6 million in capital assets in fiscal 2006. New store openings were 185 for fiscal 2008, 186 for fiscal 2007, and 204 for fiscal 2006. We invest a portion of our assets held by the Companys wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities. We acquired $54.3 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2008, $94.6 million in fiscal 2007 and $160.0 million in fiscal 2006. We had proceeds from matured marketable securities of $50.7 million in fiscal 2008, $86.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $145.4 million in fiscal 2006. Capital asset disposals provided $4.0 million in fiscal 2008, $3.5 million in fiscal 2007, and $9.8 million in fiscal 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was $522.7 million in fiscal 2008, $621.4 million in fiscal 2007, and $537.7 million in fiscal 2006. The net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled $849.2 million for fiscal 2008, $761.9 million for fiscal 2007, and $578.1 million for fiscal 2006. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations, and at times, by increases in debt levels. Proceeds from issuance of debt reflected $750.0 million for fiscal 2008, none for fiscal 2007 and $200.0 million for fiscal 2006. Debt repayments totaled $229.8 million for fiscal 2008, $5.8 million for fiscal 2007 and $152.7 million for fiscal 2006. As discussed in Note F, in August 2008, we issued $500.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes due 2014 and $250.0 million in 7.125% Senior Notes due 2018. A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of debt was used to repay outstanding commercial paper, which had increased for the repayment of the $190.0 million senior notes that matured in July. We intend to use the remainder of the proceeds to redeem or repurchase existing debt, for working capital needs, for capital expenditures, for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes. Net repayments of commercial paper were $206.7 million for fiscal 2008 and $52.0 million for fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2007, net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were $84.3 million. 21 Table of Contents We expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2009, primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and systems. In addition to the building and land costs, our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be impacted by a prolonged tightening of the credit markets which may directly limit our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us. Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past. Credit Ratings At August 30, 2008, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from Standard Poors of BBB and a commercial paper rating of A 2. Moodys Investors Service had assigned the Company a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2 and a commercial paper rating of P 2. Fitch Ratings assigned the Company a BBB rating for senior unsecured debt and an F 2 rating for commercial paper. As of August 30, 2008, Moodys, Standard Poors and Fitch had AutoZone listed as having a stable outlook. If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will likely increase, as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit. If our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become more limited. Debt Facilities We maintain $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks to primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short term unsecured bank loans. The credit facilities may be increased to $1.3 billion at AutoZones election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval, may include up to $200 million in letters of credit, and may include up to $100 million in capital leases. As the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit, the Company had $879.7 million in available capacity under these facilities at August 30, 2008. The rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of Bank of Americas base rate or a Eurodollar rate (each as defined in the facility agreements), or a combination thereof. These facilities expire in May 2010. Our $300.0 million bank term loan entered in December 2004 was amended in April 2006 to have similar terms and conditions as the $1.0 billion credit facilities, but with a December 2009 maturity, and was further amended in August 2007 to reduce the interest rate on Eurodollar loans. That credit agreement with a group of banks provides for a term loan, which consists of, at our election, base rate loans, Eurodollar loans or a combination thereof. The interest accrues on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage, which can range from 30 basis points to 90 basis points, depending upon our senior unsecured (non credit enhanced) long term debt rating. Based on our ratings at August 30, 2008, the applicable percentage on Eurodollar loans is 35 basis points. We may select interest periods of one, two, three or six months for Eurodollar loans, subject to availability. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on December 29, 2004, to effectively fix, based on current debt ratings, the interest rate of the term loan at 4.4%. We have the option to extend loans into subsequent interest period(s) or convert them into loans of another interest rate type. The entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan will be due and payable in full on December 23, 2009, when the facility terminates. We may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar borrowings. 22 Table of Contents On June 25, 2008, we entered into an agreement with ESL Investments, Inc., setting forth certain understandings and agreements (see Exhibit 10.32 for complete details) regarding the voting by ESL Investments, Inc., on behalf of itself and its affiliates (collectively, ESL), of certain shares of common stock of AutoZone, Inc. and related matters. Among other things, we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to increase our adjusted debt/EBITDAR target ratio from 2.1:1 to 2.5:1 no later than February 14, 2009. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, capital lease obligations and rent times six; and we calculate EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and options expenses to net income. During July 2008, our $190.0 million Senior Notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper. On August 4, 2008, we issued $500.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes due 2014 and $250.0 million in 7.125% Senior Notes due 2018 under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2008. We used a portion of the proceeds to pay down our commercial paper and intend to use the remainder for general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. During April 2006, our $150.0 million Senior Notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper. On June 8, 2006, we issued $200.0 million in 6.95% Senior Notes due 2016 under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 17, 2004. That shelf registration allowed us to sell up to $300 million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt, and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. The remainder of the shelf registration was cancelled in February, 2007. The 6.50% and 7.125% notes issued during August, 2008, are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded and a provision where repayment of the notes may be accelerated if AutoZone experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our other Senior Notes arrangements contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. Under our other borrowing arrangements, covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. As of August 30, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants. Stock Repurchases During 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our Board of Directors. The program was amended in June 2008 to increase the repurchase authorization to $6.4 billion from $5.9 billion. From January 1998 to August 30, 2008, we have repurchased a total of 106.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of $6.3 billion. We repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $849.2 million during fiscal 2008, 6.0 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $761.9 million during fiscal 2007, and 6.2 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $578.1 million during fiscal 2006. On September 23, 2008, the Board of Directors raised the repurchase authorization from $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion. From August 31, 2008 to October 20, 2008, we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $204.4 million. 23 Table of Contents Financial Commitments The following table shows AutoZones significant contractual obligations as of August 30, 2008: Total Payment Due by Period Contractual Less than Between Between Over 5 (in thousands) Obligations 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years years Long term debt (1) $ 2,250,000 $ $ 500,000 $ 500,000 $ 1,250,000 Interest payments (2) 764,985 134,153 237,208 205,362 188,262 Operating leases (3) 1,372,451 161,435 283,836 219,645 707,535 Capital leases (4) 68,710 16,341 31,568 20,801 Self insurance reserves (5) 147,594 49,081 44,986 22,637 30,890 Construction commitments 19,972 19,972 $ 4,623,712 $ 380,982 $ 1,097,598 $ 968,445 $ 2,176,687 (1) Long term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. (2) Represents obligations for interest payments on long term debt, including the effect of interest rate hedges. (3) Operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. (4) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (5) The Company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general and product liability, property, and automotive insurance. These amounts represent undiscounted estimates based on actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns. Accordingly, the Company reflects the net present value of these obligations in its consolidated balance sheets. We have other obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities or due to the nature of the account. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2009 that are included in current liabilities. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 30, 2008. Total Other (in thousands) Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 93,993 Surety bonds 13,844 $ 107,837 A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses. In conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some of our commercial customers. The majority of our receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. AutoZone has recorded a reserve for this recourse. At August 30, 2008, the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of $55.4 million and the balance of the recourse reserve was $1.2 million. 24 Table of Contents Value of Pension Assets At August 30, 2008, the fair market value of AutoZones pension assets was $160.9 million, and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $156.7 million based on a May 31, 2008 measurement date. On January 1, 2003, our defined benefit pension plans were frozen. Accordingly, plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas, and no new participants may join the plans. The material assumptions for fiscal 2008 are an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0% and a discount rate of 6.90%. For additional information regarding AutoZones qualified and non qualified pension plans refer to Note I Pensions and Savings Plans in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures Selected Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value. Non GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Companys comparative year to year operating results. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors use the abovementioned non GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following reconciliation tables. Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measure: Cash Flow Before Share Repurchases and Changes in Debt The following table reconciles net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents to cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt, which is presented in the Selected Financial Data.

Stockholders equity (in thousands) was $373,758 at August 30, 2003. (3) Rent is multiplied by a factor of six to capitalize operating leases in the determination of pre tax invested capital. This calculation excludes the impact from the cumulative lease accounting adjustments recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. (4) Average of the capital lease obligations relating to vehicle capital leases entered into at the beginning of fiscal 2007 is computed as the average over the trailing 13 periods. Rent expense associated with the vehicles prior to the conversion to capital leases is included in the rent for purposes of calculating return on invested capital.

This interpretation establishes new standards for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. For additional information on the impact of adoption of FIN 48, refer to Note D Income Taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. On August 25, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, and the recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) of the plan. Refer to Note I, Pension and Savings Plans for further description of this adoption. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsors year end. We currently use a May 31 measurement date for our plans; therefore, this standard will require us to change our measurement date to our fiscal year end beginning in fiscal 2009. The impact from adopting the measurement provisions is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This new standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities and at the beginning of fiscal 2010 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have an immediate material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). This new standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 will be effective for AutoZone in fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we do not currently intend to elect to apply fair value to any financial instruments that are not already reported at fair value. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement 141R, Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R). This standard significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of business combinations in consolidated financial statements. Among other things, SFAS 141R requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date and requires the expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs. The standard is effective for us beginning August 30, 2009 (fiscal 2010) and is applicable only to transactions occurring after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, including an amendment for ARB No. 51, (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends ARB No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for us beginning August 30, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends SFAS No. 133 to change the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for AutoZone beginning in fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 161. 27 Table of Contents In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days after the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU section 411. Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and Cost of Sales We state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Included in inventory are related purchasing, storage and handling costs. Due to price deflation on the Companys merchandise purchases, the Companys inventory balances are effectively maintained under the first in, first out method as the Companys policy is not to write up inventory for favorable LIFO adjustments, resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the higher amount. The nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit. We provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs. Additionally, we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrinkage. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Vendor Allowances AutoZone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements. Monies received from vendors include rebates, allowances and promotional funds. The amounts to be received are subject to purchase volumes and the terms of the vendor agreements, which generally do not state an expiration date, but are subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in market conditions, vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell through of the related merchandise. Rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product, but only if it is reasonably certain that the required volume levels will be reached. These monies are recorded as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold. Allowances and promotional funds earned under vendor funding programs are accounted for pursuant to the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor (EITF 02 16). The majority of the vendor funds received is recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold. For arrangements that provide for reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the Company in selling the vendors products, the vendor funds are recorded as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period in which the specific costs were incurred. 28 Table of Contents Impairments In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets, such as property and equipment, covered by this standard annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. We compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists. We perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments. If impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations, the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment loss. Such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed, which could differ from actual results. Self Insurance We retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, vehicle, employee health, general and product liability and property losses; and we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. Through various methods, which include analyses of historical trends and utilization of actuaries, the Company estimates the costs of these risks. The long term portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. We believe the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. Income Taxes We accrue and pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax matters in dispute with state, federal and foreign tax authorities. We measure and record income tax contingency accruals in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to statues, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual. We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities. The remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date. These noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in the caption Other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities We have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business, such as employment matters, product liability claims and general liability claims related to our store premises. We calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities. 29 Table of Contents Pension Obligation Prior to January 1, 2003, substantially all full time employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive five year average compensation. On January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. On January 1, 2003, the Companys supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. As the plan benefits are frozen, the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels, but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances: i. Expected long term rate of return on plan assets: estimated by considering the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. ii. Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations: adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date (May 31) using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. This same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year. If such assumptions differ materially from actual experience, the impact could be material to our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk AutoZone is exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks. To date, based upon our current level of foreign operations, hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates, no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our Board of Directors. Further, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk AutoZones financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps. AutoZone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. We reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets. All of the Companys interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. We had an outstanding interest rate swap with a fair value of ($4.3) million at August 30, 2008, and $5.8 million at August 25, 2007, to effectively fix the interest rate on the $300.0 million term loan entered into during December 2004. The related gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. The Companys hedge instrument was determined to be highly effective as of August 30, 2008. 30 Table of Contents The fair value of our debt was estimated at $2.235 billion as of August 30, 2008, and $1.928 billion as of August 25, 2007, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to AutoZone for debt having the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by $15.0 million at August 30, 2008, and less than the carrying value of debt by $7.6 million at August 25, 2007. Considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, we had no variable rate debt outstanding at August 30, 2008, and $245.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 25, 2007. In fiscal 2007, at this borrowing level for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of $2.5 million, which includes the effects of the interest rate swap. The primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR. Considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, we had outstanding fixed rate debt of $2.250 billion at August 30, 2008, and $1.690 billion at August 25, 2007. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by $90.7 million at August 30, 2008, and $60.8 million at August 25, 2007. Fuel Price Risk Fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of SFAS 133 and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel and unleaded fuel exposure. We did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during the 2008 or 2006 fiscal years. During fiscal 2007 we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure. These swaps were settled within a few days of the fiscal year end and had no significant impact on cost of sales for the 2007 fiscal year. 31 Table of Contents
