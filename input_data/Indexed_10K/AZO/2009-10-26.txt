Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are the nations leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories. We began operations in 1979 and at August 29, 2009, operated 4,229 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 188 in Mexico. Each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products. At August 29, 2009, in 2,303 of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com. Additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products through www.autozone.com, and as part of our commercial sales program, through www.autozonepro.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services. Executive Summary We achieved a solid performance in fiscal 2009, delivering record earnings of $657 million and sales growth of $420 million over the prior year, excluding the 53rd week in last years results. We completed the year with strong growth in our commercial and retail businesses. We are excited about our retail business opportunities and encouraged by the increase in our commercial business, where we continued to build our internal sales force and to refine our parts assortment. There are various factors occuring within the current economy that affect both our customers and our industry, including the credit crisis and higher unemployment, which we believe when combined have aided our sales growth during the year. We continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macro economic environment. The two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. Miles driven declined for the sixteenth straight month in March, were relatively flat in April and May before increasing in June and July. We are optimistic that over the long term this trend will stabilize at low single digit increases as the number of vehicles on the road continues to increase. New vehicle sales declined significantly during 2008 and the first half of 2009, which we believe is contributing to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. In the near term, we expect this trend to continue, as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy. Also, we believe gas prices impact our customers behavior with respect to driving and maintaining their cars. With approximately ten billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the United States, each $1 dollar decrease at the pump contributes approximately $10 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month. During the summer of 2008, gas prices peaked at roughly $4 per gallon, before falling to $2 per gallon in February 2009. By the end of fiscal 2009, gas prices had risen to approximately $2.61 per gallon. During fiscal 2009, we worked hard to execute on several key initiatives as the macro environment turned in our industrys favor and we saw an increase in traffic in our stores. We significantly enhanced the utilization of our hub stores by refining and improving the product assortment in these locations while simultaneously increasing the delivery frequency to nearby stores. We accelerated our store maintenance efforts and also deployed additional capital in areas that we expect to yield benefits in the future, such as enhancing our IT infrastructure and continued additions of late model products. We also began an effort to purchase more of our new store locations rather than leasing them. Finally, we maintained our focus on developing a first class Commercial field sales organization by continuing to expand the size of our team and investing in training, tools and management programs. In this challenging environment, we continue to see sales of maintenance and failure categories perform well, while discretionary categories are being negatively impacted. Consequently, we remain focused on refining and expanding our product assortment to ensure we have the best merchandise at the right price in each of our merchandise categories. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 For the year ended August 29, 2009, AutoZone reported net sales of $6.817 billion compared with $6.523 billion for the year ended August 30, 2008, a 4.5% increase from fiscal 2008. Excluding $125.9 million of sales from the 53rd week included in the prior year, total company net sales increased 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 4.4% and sales from new stores of $165.5 million. The improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends, while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our long term trends. Higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex, costly products and commodity price increases. At August 29, 2009, we operated 4,229 domestic stores and 188 stores in Mexico, compared with 4,092 domestic stores and 148 stores in Mexico at August 30, 2008. Excluding the sales from the 53rd week in the prior year, domestic retail sales increased 7.1% and domestic commercial sales increased 4.3%. Gross profit for fiscal 2009 was $3.416 billion, or 50.1% of net sales, compared with $3.268 billion, or 50.1% of net sales for fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was positively impacted by favorable distribution costs from improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs. However, this favorability was largely offset by a shift in mix to lower margin products. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 increased to $2.240 billion, or 32.9% of net sales, from $2.144 billion, or 32.9% of net sales for fiscal 2008. Leverage from increased sales was largely offset by expenses associated with our continued enhancements to our hub stores, an acceleration of our store maintenance program, and a continued expansion of our Commercial sales force. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2009 was $142.3 million compared with $116.7 million during fiscal 2008. This increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and a higher percentage of fixed rate debt. Average borrowings for fiscal 2009 were $2.460 billion, compared with $2.024 billion for fiscal 2008 and weighted average borrowing rates were 5.4% for fiscal 2009, compared to 5.2% for fiscal 2008. Our effective income tax rate was 36.4% of pre tax income for fiscal 2009 compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2008. Refer to Note D Income Taxes for additional information regarding our income tax rate. Net income for fiscal 2009 increased by 2.4% to $657.0 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 16.8% to $11.73 from $10.04 in fiscal 2008. The impact of the fiscal 2009 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was an increase of approximately $0.78. Excluding the additional week in the prior year, net income for the year increased 5.0% over the previous year, while diluted earnings per share increased 19.7%. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007 For the year ended August 30, 2008, AutoZone reported net sales of $6.523 billion compared with $6.170 billion for the year ended August 25, 2007, a 5.7% increase from fiscal 2007. This growth was primarily driven by net sales of $166.6 million for fiscal 2008 from new stores, $125.9 million, or a 1.9% increase, from the addition of the 53rd week and a domestic same store sales (excluding 53rd week) increase of 0.4%. At August 30, 2008, we operated 4,092 domestic stores and 148 in Mexico, compared with 3,933 domestic stores and 123 in Mexico at August 25, 2007. The domestic same store sales increase was driven by higher average transaction value, partially offset by lower transaction count. Higher transaction value was primarily attributable to product price inflation due both to more complex, costly products and to commodity price increases. Transaction counts were lower due to a combination of factors, including product life cycles and deferred maintenance. Including the 53rd week, domestic retail sales increased 4.5% and domestic commercial sales increased 6.8% from prior year. ALLDATA and Mexico sales, including the 53rd week, increased over prior year, contributing 1.2 percentage points of the total increase in net sales. Gross profit for fiscal 2008 was $3.268 billion, or 50.1% of net sales, compared with $3.064 billion, or 49.7% of net sales, for fiscal 2007. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales was primarily due to an approximately 50 basis point benefit from category management efforts, including increases in average retail prices of products sold and vendor supported promotional activities. These efforts were partially offset by increased distribution expense principally relating to higher fuel costs. 20 Table of Contents Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 increased to $2.144 billion, or 32.9% of net sales, from $2.009 billion, or 32.6% of net sales for fiscal 2007. Approximately 20 basis points of the increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was due to higher employee medical expense driven by an increase in the number of catastrophic claims. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher fuel expense for our commercial fleet from increased fuel prices (approximately 6 basis points of the increase). Interest expense, net for fiscal 2008 was $116.7 million compared with $119.1 million during fiscal 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower short term rates and was offset by higher average borrowing levels over the comparable fiscal 2007 period and the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2008. Average borrowings for fiscal 2008 were $2.024 billion, compared with $1.972 billion for fiscal 2007. Weighted average borrowing rates were 5.2% at August 30, 2008, compared to 5.7% at August 25, 2007. Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% of pre tax income for fiscal 2008 compared to 36.4% for fiscal 2007. Net income for fiscal 2008 increased by 7.7% to $641.6 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 17.8% to $10.04 from $8.53 in fiscal 2007. The impact of the fiscal 2008 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008 was an increase of approximately $0.29. Excluding the additional week, net income for the year increased 5.1% over the previous year to $625.8 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 14.9% to $9.80 per share. Seasonality and Quarterly Periods AutoZones business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of March through September, in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months of December through February. During short periods of time, a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales, as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather, with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Each of the first three quarters of AutoZones fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2009, 17 weeks in 2008, and 16 weeks in 2007. Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, containing 16 weeks, represented 32.7% of annual sales and 35.9% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, containing 17 weeks, represented 33.9% of annual sales and 38.0% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, containing 16 weeks, represented 32.5% of annual sales and 36.5% of net income. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories. Net cash provided by operating activities was $923.8 million in fiscal 2009, $921.1 million in fiscal 2008, and $845.2 million in fiscal 2007. The increase over prior year was primarily due to the growth in net income and to a lesser extent, timing of income tax payments and deductions, and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors continue to finance a large portion of our inventory. Partially offsetting this increase were higher accounts receivable and the 53rd week of income in last years sales. The increase in fiscal 2008 verses fiscal 2007 was due primarily to higher net income and an increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio. We had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 96% at August 29, 2009, 95% at August 30, 2008, and 93% at August 25, 2007. Our inventory increases are primarily attributable to an increased number of stores and to a lesser extent, our efforts to update product assortment in all of our stores. Additionally, many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortment by providing extended payment terms. These extended payment terms have allowed us to grow accounts payable at a faster rate than inventory. 21 Table of Contents AutoZones primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program. From the beginning of fiscal 2007 to August 29, 2009, we have opened 551 new stores. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $263.7 million in fiscal 2009, compared to $243.2 million in fiscal 2008, and $228.7 million in fiscal 2007. We invested $272.2 million in capital assets in fiscal 2009, compared to $243.6 million in capital assets in fiscal 2008, and $224.5 million in capital assets in fiscal 2007. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to the types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores. New store openings were 180 for fiscal 2009, 185 for fiscal 2008, and 186 for fiscal 2007. We invest a portion of our assets held by the Companys wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities. We acquired $48.4 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2009, $54.3 million in fiscal 2008, and $94.6 million in fiscal 2007. We had proceeds from matured marketable securities of $46.3 million in fiscal 2009, $50.7 million in fiscal 2008, and $86.9 million in fiscal 2007. Capital asset disposals provided $10.7 million in fiscal 2009, $4.0 million in fiscal 2008, and $3.5 million in fiscal 2007. Net cash used in financing activities was $806.9 million in fiscal 2009, $522.7 million in fiscal 2008, and $621.4 million in fiscal 2007. The net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled $1.3 billion for fiscal 2009, $849.2 million for fiscal 2008, and $761.9 million for fiscal 2007. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations, and at times, by increases in debt levels. Proceeds from issuance of debt were $500.0 million for fiscal 2009, $750.0 million for fiscal 2008, and none for fiscal 2007. Debt repayments totaled $300.7 million for fiscal 2009, $229.8 million for fiscal 2008, and $5.8 million for fiscal 2007. As discussed in Note H Financing, in July 2009, we issued $500.0 million in 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015. The proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness, to prepay our $300 million term loan in August 2009 and for general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, new store openings and stock repurchases. Net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were $277.6 million for fiscal 2009 and $84.3 million for fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008, net repayments of commercial paper were $206.7 million. We expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2010, primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure. In addition to the building and land costs, our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be impacted by a prolonged tightening of the credit markets which may directly limit our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us. Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past. Credit Ratings At August 29, 2009, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from Standard Poors of BBB and a commercial paper rating of A 2. Moodys Investors Service had assigned the Company a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2 and a commercial paper rating of P 2. Fitch Ratings assigned the Company a BBB rating for senior unsecured debt and an F 2 rating for commercial paper. As of August 29, 2009, Moodys, Standard Poors and Fitch had AutoZone listed as having a stable outlook. If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense will increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will likely increase, as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit. If our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become more limited. 22 Table of Contents Debt Facilities In July, 2009, we terminated our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2010, and replaced it with an $800 million revolving credit facility. This credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short term unsecured bank loans. The credit facility may be increased to $1.0 billion at AutoZones election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval, may include up to $200 million in letters of credit, and may include up to $100 million in capital leases each fiscal year. As the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit, the Company had $410.5 million in available capacity under this facility at August 29, 2009. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage, which could range from 150 basis points to 450 basis points, depending upon our senior unsecured (non credit enhanced) long term debt rating. This facility expires in July 2012. During August 2009, we elected to prepay, without penalty, our $300 million bank term loan entered in December 2004, and subsequently amended. The term loan facility provided for a term loan, which consisted of, at our election, base rate loans, Eurodollar loans or a combination thereof. The entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan was due and payable in full on December 23, 2009, when the facility was scheduled to terminate. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on December 29, 2004, to effectively fix, based on current debt ratings, the interest rate of the term loan at 4.4%. The outstanding liability associated with the interest rate swap totaled $3.6 million, and was expensed in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses upon termination of the hedge in fiscal 2009. On June 25, 2008, we entered into an agreement with ESL Investments, Inc. (the ESL Agreement), setting forth certain understandings and agreements regarding the voting by ESL Investments, Inc., on behalf of itself and its affiliates (collectively, ESL), of certain shares of common stock of AutoZone, Inc. and related matters. Among other things, we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to increase our adjusted debt/EBITDAR target ratio from 2.1:1 to 2.5:1 no later than February 14, 2009. We met this commitment at February 14, 2009. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, capital lease obligations and annual rent times six; and we calculate EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option expenses to net income. At August 29, 2009, our adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio was 2.5:1. (The ESL agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.22 to this Form 10 K). On August 4, 2008, we issued $500 million in 6.50% Senior Notes due 2014 and $250 million in 7.125% Senior Notes due 2018 under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2008 (the Shelf Registration). That shelf registration allowed us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. On July 2, 2009, we issued $500 million in 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015 under the Shelf Registration. We used the proceeds to pay down our commercial paper borrowings, to prepay in full our $300 million term loan in August 2009, and the remainder for general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, new store openings and stock repurchases. The 6.50% and 7.125% Senior Notes issued during August 2008, and the 5.75% Senior Notes issued in July 2009, are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded. They also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if AutoZone experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. Under our other borrowing arrangements, covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. The $800 million revolving credit agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.50:1. This ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of August 29, 2009 was 4.19:1. As of August 29, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants. 23 Table of Contents Stock Repurchases During 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our Board of Directors. The program was last amended in June 2009 to increase the repurchase authorization to $7.9 billion from $7.4 billion. From January 1998 to August 29, 2009, we have repurchased a total of 115.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $7.6 billion. We repurchased 9.3 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.3 billion during fiscal 2009, 6.8 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $849.2 million during fiscal 2008, and 6.0 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $761.9 million during fiscal 2007. From August 30, 2009 to October 26, 2009, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $178.2 million. Financial Commitments The following table shows AutoZones significant contractual obligations as of August 29, 2009: Total Payment Due by Period Contractual Less than Between Between Over 5 (in thousands) Obligations 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years years Long term debt (1) $ 2,726,900 $ 277,600 $ 199,300 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,250,000 Interest payments (2) 780,175 145,338 276,425 220,237 138,175 Operating leases (3) 1,558,027 177,781 319,650 251,149 809,447 Capital leases (4) 55,703 16,932 30,132 8,639 Self insurance reserves (5) 153,602 54,307 44,840 23,673 30,782 Construction commitments 18,749 18,749 $ 5,293,156 $ 690,707 $ 870,347 $ 1,503,698 $ 2,228,404 (1) Long term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. (2) Represents obligations for interest payments on long term debt. (3) Operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. (4) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (5) The Company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general and product liability, property, and vehicle insurance. These amounts represent estimates based on actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns. Accordingly, the Company reflects the net present value of these obligations in its consolidated balance sheets. We have Pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account. As disclosed in Note K Pension and Savings Plans, our pension liability is $185.6 million and our pension assets are $115.3 million at August 29, 2009. Additionally, as disclosed in Note D Income Taxes, our tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $56.6 million at August 29, 2009. Approximately $25.9 million is classified as short term and $30.7 million is classified as long term. We did not reflect these obligations in the Financial Commitments table as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of these tax positions. 24 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 29, 2009. Total Other (in thousands) Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 111,904 Surety bonds 14,818 $ 126,722 A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses. In conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some of our commercial customers. Historically, certain of the receivables related to this credit program were sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. At August 30, 2008, we had $55.4 million outstanding under this program. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, AutoZone terminated its agreement to sell receivables to a third party. There were no amounts outstanding under this program as of August 29, 2009. Value of Pension Assets At August 29, 2009, the fair market value of AutoZones pension assets was $115.3 million, and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $185.6 million based on an August 29, 2009 measurement date. On January 1, 2003, our defined benefit pension plans were frozen. Accordingly, plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas, and no new participants may join the plans. The material assumptions for fiscal 2009 are an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0% and a discount rate of 6.24%. For additional information regarding AutoZones qualified and non qualified pension plans refer to Note K Pension and Savings Plans in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures Selected Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value. Non GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Companys comparative year to year operating results. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors use the above mentioned non GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following reconciliation tables. 25 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measure: Cash Flow Before Share Repurchases and Changes in Debt The following table reconciles net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents to cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt, which is presented in the Selected Financial Data.

SFAS 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively postretirement benefit plans) to: recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial position, and provide additional disclosures. On August 25, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions and on August 31, 2008, we adopted the measurement date provisions. The adoption of these provisions had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note K Pension and Savings Plans for further description of these adoptions. On August 31, 2008, we adopted, FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This new standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. There is a one year deferral of the adoption of this standard as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement 141R, Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R). This standard significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of business combinations in consolidated financial statements. Among other things, SFAS 141R requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date and requires the expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs. The standard is effective for us beginning August 30, 2009 and is applicable only to transactions occurring after the effective date. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends SFAS No. 133 to improve the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities by providing enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The adoption of SFAS 161 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 107 1 (FSP 107 1) and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28 1 (APB 28 1), Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, amending the disclosure requirements in SFAS 107 and APB Opinion 28. FSP 107 1 and APB 28 1 require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods in addition to annual reporting periods. These disclosures will be required commencing with our fiscal quarter beginning August 30, 2009. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events (SFAS 165), which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. Specifically, SFAS 165 sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. We adopted SFAS 165 on August 29, 2009, and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued. In June 2009, the FASB voted to approve the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Codification will be effective for us commencing with our fiscal quarter beginning August 30, 2009. The FASB Codification does not change U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but combines all authoritative standards such as those issued by the FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Emerging Issues Task Force into a comprehensive topically organized online database. 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory Reserves and cost of sales LIFO We state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for domestic merchandise and the first in, first out (FIFO) method for Mexico inventories. Due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases, our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the FIFO method. We do not write up inventory for favorable LIFO adjustments, and due to price deflation, LIFO costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by $223.0 million at August 29, 2009, calculated using the dollar value method. Inventory Obsolescence and Shrinkage Our inventory, primarily hard parts, maintenance items and accessories/non automotive products, is used on vehicles that have rather long lives; and therefore, the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit. In the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs, we record a charge (less than $15 million in each of the last three years) through cost of sales for the difference. These charges are based on managements judgment, including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods. Historically, we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory, nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates. However, we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns. Additionally, we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage, which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories. Shrinkage may occur due to theft, loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods, among other things. Throughout the year, we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates. We make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results. Over the last three years, there has been less than a 25 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate. Each quarter, we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results. To the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates, we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements. Historically, we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use. A 10% difference in our inventory reserves as of August 29, 2009, would have affected net income by approximately $3 million in fiscal 2009. 29 Table of Contents Vendor allowances AutoZone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for warranties, advertising and general promotion of vendor products. Vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory, unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the Company in selling the vendors products. Approximately 90% of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold. Based on our vendor agreements, a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases. Therefore, we record receivables for funding not yet received as we purchase inventory. During the year, we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations. We have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them. Historically, we have had minimal write offs (less than $100 thousand in any of the last three years) and these write offs were due to severed relationships. Self Insurance We retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, vehicle, employee health, general and products liability and property losses; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. Our self insurance reserve estimates totaled $158 million, $145 million, and $133 million as of the end of fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These increases are primarily reflective of our growing operations, including inflation and increases in vehicles and the number of hours worked. The assumptions made by management in estimating our self insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims, and claims incurred, but not yet reported. The actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. When estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends, and projected inflation of related factors. In recent history, we have experienced improvements in frequency and duration of claims; however, medical and wage inflation have partially offset these trends. Throughout this time, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and these trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. Management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. For example, changes in our assumptions about health care costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. For instance, a 10% change in our self insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $10 million for fiscal 2009. As we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. In recent years, we have experienced favorable claims development, particularly related to workers compensation, and have adjusted our estimates accordingly. We attribute this success to programs, such as return to work and projects aimed at accelerating claims closure. The programs have matured and proven to be successful and are therefore considered in our current and future assumptions regarding claims costs. Our liabilities for workers compensation, certain general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our balance sheet using the risk free interest rate as of the balance sheet date. If the discount rate used to calculate present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points, net income would have changed approximately $2 million at August 29, 2009. Our liability for health benefits is classified as current, as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our income tax returns are audited by state, federal and foreign tax authorities, and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time. Tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation, appeals and experience with previous similar tax positions. We regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded. As of August 29, 2009, we had approximately $56.6 million reserved for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings in accordance with FIN 48 by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years; however, actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. Specifically, management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of certain tax positions. Additionally, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or must pay in excess of recognized reserves, our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected. Pension Obligation Prior to January 1, 2003, substantially all full time employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive five year average compensation. On January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. On January 1, 2003, the Companys supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. As the plan benefits are frozen, the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels, but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances: i. Expected long term rate of return on plan assets: As described more fully in Note K Pension and Savings Plans, we have assumed an 8% long term rate of return on our plan assets. This estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. We review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis, and revise it accordingly. Additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets. At August 29, 2009, our plan assets totaled $115 million in our qualified plan. We have no assets in our nonqualified plan. A 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense/income by approximately $570 thousand for the qualified plan. ii. Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations: This rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. This same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year. For fiscal 2009, we assumed a discount rate of 6.24%. A decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate at August 29, 2009 would impact annual pension expense/income by approximately $1.9 million for the qualified plan and $30 thousand for the nonqualified plan. 31 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk AutoZone is exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks. To date, based upon our current level of foreign operations, no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our Board of Directors. Further, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk AutoZones financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps. AutoZone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. We reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets or liabilities. All of the Companys interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. We had an outstanding interest rate swap with a negative fair value of $4.3 million at August 30, 2008, to effectively fix the interest rate on the $300 million term loan entered into during December 2004. During the current fiscal year, we prepaid the term loan and terminated the interest rate swap; as a result, at August 29, 2009, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. For further discussion, see Note G Derivative Financial Instruments. The fair value of our debt was estimated at $2.853 billion as of August 29, 2009, and $2.235 billion as of August 30, 2008, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to AutoZone for debt having the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by $126.5 million at August 29, 2009, and less than the carrying value of debt by $15.0 million at August 30, 2008. We had $277.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 29, 2009, and considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, no variable rate debt outstanding at August 30, 2008. In fiscal 2009, at this borrowing level for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of $2.8 million, which includes the effects of the interest rate swap. The primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR. We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $2.449 billion at August 29, 2009, and considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, $2.250 billion at August 30, 2008. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by $105.9 million at August 29, 2009, and $90.7 million at August 30, 2008. Fuel Price Risk Fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of SFAS 133 and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure. In fiscal year 2009, we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our unleaded fuel exposure. We did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during the 2008 fiscal year and during fiscal year 2007, we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our unleaded and diesel fuel exposures. As of August 29, 2009, we had an outstanding liability of less than one hundred thousand dollars associated with our unleaded fuel swap and no outstanding fuel swap contracts at August 25, 2007. The swaps during fiscal years 2009 and 2007 had no significant impact on our results of operations in either year. 32 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. The Company and its subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies. Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material. The Companys primary foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars. The Company generally views as long term its investments in the Mexican subsidiaries, which have the Mexican peso as the functional currency. As a result, the Company generally does not hedge these net investments. The net investment in Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year end exchange rates was $215.4 million at August 29, 2009 and $160.8 million at August, 30, 2008. The potential loss in value of the Companys net investment in Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at August 29, 2009 and August, 30, 2008 amounted to $19.6 million and $14.6 million, respectively. This change would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the equity section of the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. During 2009, exchange rates with respect to the Mexican peso decreased by approximately 30% with respect to the U.S. dollar. The resulting foreign currency translation losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 33 Table of Contents
