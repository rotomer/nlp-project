Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are the nations leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories. We began operations in 1979 and at August 28, 2010, operated 4,389 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 238 in Mexico. Each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products. At August 28, 2010, in 2,424 of our domestic stores and 173 of our Mexico stores, we also have a commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com. Additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products through www.autozone.com, and as part of our commercial sales program, through www.autozonepro.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services. Executive Summary We achieved a strong performance in fiscal 2010, delivering record earnings of $738 million and sales growth of $546 million over the prior year. We completed the year with strong growth in our commercial and retail businesses. We are excited about our retail business opportunities and encouraged by the increase in our commercial business, where we continue to build our internal sales force and to refine our parts assortment. There are various factors occurring within the current economy that affect both our customers and our industry, including the impact of the recent recession, the credit crisis and higher unemployment. As consumers cash flows have decreased due to these factors, we believe consumers have become more likely to keep their current vehicles longer and perform repair and maintenance in order to keep those vehicles well maintained. Our belief is supported by industry data showing an increase in the average age of vehicles on the road and recent declines in new car sales, which we believe have led to an increase in demand for the products that we sell. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future. Our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message, store staffing, and product assortment. We continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macro economic environment. Also, we believe changes in gas prices impact our customers behavior with respect to driving and maintaining their cars. With approximately ten billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the United States, each $1 dollar decrease at the pump contributes approximately $10 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month. Given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease in the future, nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods. The two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. 19 Table of Contents Miles Driven We believe that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. Prior to the recession, we had seen a close correlation between annual miles driven and our annual net sales; however, this correlation has not existed in the recent short term recessionary period. Since the beginning of the fiscal year and through July 2010 (latest publicly available information), miles driven were relatively flat as compared to the comparable prior year period. Throughout this period and contrary to the correlation experienced prior to the recession, sales have grown at an increased rate, while miles driven have grown at a slower rate than what we have historically experienced. We believe that the impact of changes in other factors, primarily an increase in seven year old or older vehicles, more than offset the impact of miles driven. As the economy continues to recover, we believe that annual miles driven will return to pre recession low single digit growth rates, and the correlation between annual miles driven and the annual sales growth of our industry should return. Seven Year Old or Older Vehicles Since 2008, new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels, which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. We estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12,500 miles each year. In seven years, the average miles driven equates to approximately 87,500 miles. Our experience is that at this point in a vehicles life, most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating. According to data provided by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association, the number of seven year old or older vehicles increased by approximately 2.2% during the 2009 calendar year as compared to the 2008 calendar year. As the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases, we expect an increase in demand for the products that we sell. In the near term, we expect this trend to continue, as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy. Results of Operations Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 For the fiscal year ended August 28, 2010, we reported net sales of $7.363 billion compared with $6.817 billion for the year ended August 29, 2009, an 8.0% increase from fiscal 2009. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 5.4% and sales from new stores of $203.4 million. The improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends, while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our long term trends. Higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex, costly products and commodity price increases. At August 28, 2010, we operated 4,389 domestic stores and 238 stores in Mexico, compared with 4,229 domestic stores and 188 stores in Mexico at August 29, 2009. We reported a domestic retail sales increase of 6.9% and a domestic commercial sales increase of 13.8% for fiscal 2010. Gross profit for fiscal 2010 was $3.712 billion, or 50.4% of net sales, compared with $3.416 billion, or 50.1% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to leveraging distribution costs due to higher sales and operating efficiencies (19 basis points). Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 increased to $2.392 billion, or 32.5% of net sales, from $2.240 billion, or 32.9% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The reduction in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales, partially offset by higher pension expense (17 basis points) and the continued investment in the hub store initiative (16 basis points). Interest expense, net for fiscal 2010 was $158.9 million compared with $142.3 million during fiscal 2009. This increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period. Average borrowings for fiscal 2010 were $2.752 billion, compared with $2.460 billion for fiscal 2009 and weighted average borrowing rates were 5.3% for fiscal 2010, compared to 5.4% for fiscal 2009. Our effective income tax rate was 36.4% of pre tax income for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.4% for fiscal 2009. Net income for fiscal 2010 increased by 12.4% to $738.3 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 27.6% to $14.97 from $11.73 in fiscal 2009. The impact of the fiscal 2010 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 was an increase of approximately $0.74. 20 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 For the year ended August 29, 2009, we reported net sales of $6.817 billion compared with $6.523 billion for the year ended August 30, 2008, a 4.5% increase from fiscal 2008. Excluding $125.9 million of sales from the 53rd week included in the prior year, total company net sales increased 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 4.4% and sales from new stores of $165.5 million. The improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends, while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our long term trends. Higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex, costly products and commodity price increases. At August 29, 2009, we operated 4,229 domestic stores and 188 stores in Mexico, compared with 4,092 domestic stores and 148 stores in Mexico at August 30, 2008. Excluding the sales from the 53rd week in the prior year, domestic retail sales increased 7.1% and domestic commercial sales increased 4.3%. Gross profit for fiscal 2009 was $3.416 billion, or 50.1% of net sales, compared with $3.268 billion, or 50.1% of net sales, for fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was positively impacted by favorable distribution costs from improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs. However, this favorability was largely offset by a shift in mix to lower margin products. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 increased to $2.240 billion, or 32.9% of net sales, from $2.144 billion, or 32.9% of net sales for fiscal 2008. Leverage from increased sales was largely offset by expenses associated with our continued enhancements to our hub stores (17 basis points), an acceleration of our store maintenance program (9 basis points), and a continued expansion of our commercial sales force (7 basis points). Interest expense, net for fiscal 2009 was $142.3 million compared with $116.7 million during fiscal 2008. This increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and a higher percentage of fixed rate debt. Average borrowings for fiscal 2009 were $2.460 billion, compared with $2.024 billion for fiscal 2008 and weighted average borrowing rates were 5.4% for fiscal 2009, compared to 5.2% for fiscal 2008. Our effective income tax rate was 36.4% of pre tax income for fiscal 2009 compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2008. Net income for fiscal 2009 increased by 2.4% to $657.0 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 16.8% to $11.73 from $10.04 in fiscal 2008. The impact of the fiscal 2009 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was an increase of approximately $0.78. Excluding the additional week in the prior year, net income for the year increased 5.0% over the previous year, while diluted earnings per share increased 19.7%. Seasonality and Quarterly Periods Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of February through September, in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months of December and January. During short periods of time, a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales, as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather, with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2010, 16 weeks in 2009, and 17 weeks in 2008. Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, containing 16 weeks, represented 33.2% of annual sales and 36.4% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, containing 16 weeks, represented 32.7% of annual sales and 35.9% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, containing 17 weeks, represented 33.9% of annual sales and 38.0% of net income. 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,196.3 million in fiscal 2010, $923.8 million in fiscal 2009, and $921.1 million in fiscal 2008. The increase over prior year was primarily due to higher net income of $81.3 million and improvements in accounts payable as our cash flows from operating activities continue to benefit from our inventory purchases being largely financed by our vendors. The increase in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the growth in net income, timing of income tax payments and deductions, and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors finance a large portion of our inventory. Partially offsetting this increase were higher accounts receivable and the 53rd week of income in fiscal 2008. We had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 106% at August 28, 2010, 96% at August 29, 2009, and 95% at August 30, 2008. Our inventory increases are primarily attributable to an increased number of stores and to a lesser extent, our efforts to update product assortment in all of our stores. Many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortment by providing extended payment terms. These extended payment terms have allowed us to continue to grow accounts payable at a faster rate than inventory. Our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued new store development program. From the beginning of fiscal 2008 to August 28, 2010, we have opened 578 new stores. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $307.4 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $263.7 million in fiscal 2009, and $243.2 million in fiscal 2008. We invested $315.4 million in capital assets in fiscal 2010, compared to $272.2 million in capital assets in fiscal 2009, and $243.6 million in capital assets in fiscal 2008. The increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores. New store openings were 213 for fiscal 2010, 180 for fiscal 2009, and 185 for fiscal 2008. We invest a portion of our assets held by the Companys wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities. We acquired $56.2 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2010, $48.4 million in fiscal 2009, and $54.3 million in fiscal 2008. We had proceeds from marketable securities of $52.6 million in fiscal 2010, $46.3 million in fiscal 2009, and $50.7 million in fiscal 2008. Capital asset disposals provided $11.5 million in fiscal 2010, $10.7 million in fiscal 2009, and $4.0 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash used in financing activities was $883.5 million in fiscal 2010, $806.9 million in fiscal 2009, and $522.7 million in fiscal 2008. The net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled $1.1 billion for fiscal 2010, $1.3 billion for fiscal 2009, and $849.2 million for fiscal 2008. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations, and at times, by increases in debt levels. Proceeds from issuance of debt were $26.2 million for fiscal 2010, $500.0 million for fiscal 2009, and $750.0 million for fiscal 2008. There were no debt repayments for fiscal 2010; debt repayments were $300.7 million for fiscal 2009, and $229.8 million for fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness, to prepay our $300 million term loan in August 2009 and for general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, store openings and stock repurchases. Proceeds from the debt issuance in fiscal 2008 were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, store openings and stock repurchases. Net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were $155.4 million for fiscal 2010 and $277.6 million for fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2008, net repayments of commercial paper were $206.7 million. We expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2011, with our investment being directed primarily to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure. The amount of our investments in our new store program is impacted by different factors, including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment), located in the United States or Mexico, or located in urban or rural areas. During fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 16%, 12% and 9%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Our mix of store openings has moved away from build to suit leases (lower cost) to ground leases and land purchases (higher cost), resulting in increased capital expenditures during the previous three years, and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending August 27, 2011. In addition to the building and land costs, our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us. Certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us, allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate. 22 Table of Contents Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past. For the fiscal year ended August 28, 2010, our after tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 27.6% as compared to 24.4% for the comparable prior year period. ROIC is calculated as after tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by average invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). ROIC increased primarily due to increased after tax operating profit. We use ROIC to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. Debt Facilities In July 2009, we terminated our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2010, and replaced it with an $800 million revolving credit facility. This credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short term unsecured bank loans. The credit facility may be increased to $1.0 billion at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval, may include up to $200 million in letters of credit, and may include up to $100 million in capital leases each fiscal year. As the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit, we had $331.1 million in available capacity under this facility at August 28, 2010. Under the revolving credit facility, we may borrow funds consisting of Eurodollar loans or base rate loans. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate, defined as the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus the applicable percentage, which could range from 150 basis points to 450 basis points, depending upon our senior unsecured (non credit enhanced) long term debt rating. Interest accrues on base rate loans at the prime rate. We also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility. The revolving credit facility expires in July 2012. The revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.50:1. This ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of August 28, 2010 was 4.27:1. In June 2010, we entered into a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $100 million. The letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit facility. As of August 28, 2010, we have $100.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility, which expires in June 2013. During August 2009, we elected to prepay, without penalty, the $300 million bank term loan entered in December 2004, and subsequently amended. The term loan facility provided for a term loan, which consisted of, at our election, base rate loans, Eurodollar loans or a combination thereof. The entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan would be due and payable in full on December 23, 2009, when the facility was scheduled to terminate. Interest accrued on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on December 29, 2004, to effectively fix, based on current debt ratings, the interest rate of the term loan at 4.4%. The outstanding liability associated with the interest rate swap totaled $3.6 million, and was expensed in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses upon termination of the hedge in fiscal 2009. 23 Table of Contents On July 2, 2009, we issued $500 million in 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015 under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2008 (the Shelf Registration). Also, on August 4, 2008, we issued $500 million in 6.50% Senior Notes due 2014 and $250 million in 7.125% Senior Notes due 2018 under the Shelf Registration. The Shelf Registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. In fiscal 2009, the Company used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness, to prepay our $300 million term loan in August 2009 and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the debt issuance in fiscal 2008 were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The 5.75% Senior Notes issued in July 2009 and the 6.50% and 7.125% Senior Notes issued during August 2008, (collectively, the Notes), are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the Notes are downgraded. They also contain a provision that repayment of the Notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. Under our revolving credit facility, covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. As of August 28, 2010, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future. Our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share based compensation expense (EBITDAR) ratio was 2.4:1 and 2.5:1 as of August 28, 2010 and August 29, 2009, respectively. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, capital lease obligations and rent times six; and we calculate EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share based compensation expense to net income. We target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. We believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels. Stock Repurchases During 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our Board of Directors. The program was amended in June 2010 to increase the repurchase authorization to $8.9 billion from $8.4 billion. From January 1998 to August 28, 2010, we have repurchased a total of 121.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $8.7 billion. We repurchased 6.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion during fiscal 2010, 9.3 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.3 billion during fiscal 2009, and 6.8 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $849.2 million during fiscal 2008. Considering cumulative repurchases as of August 28, 2010, we have $185.4 million remaining under the Board of Directors authorization to repurchase our common stock. On September 28, 2010, the Board of Directors voted to increase the authorization by $500 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from $8.9 billion to $9.4 billion. We have repurchased approximately 800 thousand shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $185.9 million during fiscal 2011. 24 Table of Contents Financial Commitments The following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of August 28, 2010: Total Payment Due by Period Contractual Less than Between Between Over (in thousands) Obligations 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Long term debt (1) $ 2,882,300 $ 632,300 $ 500,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 750,000 Interest payments (2) 617,225 140,600 245,238 155,800 75,587 Operating leases (3) 1,740,047 196,291 357,943 284,836 900,977 Capital leases (4) 92,745 21,947 44,832 25,966 Self insurance reserves (5) 158,384 60,955 43,045 22,688 31,696 Construction commitments 15,757 15,757 $ 5,506,458 $ 1,067,850 $ 1,191,058 $ 1,489,290 $ 1,758,260 (1) Long term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. (2) Represents obligations for interest payments on long term debt. (3) Operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. (4) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (5) We retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general and product liability, property, and vehicle insurance. These amounts represent estimates based on actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our consolidated balance sheets. We have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account. As of August 28, 2010, our pension liability is $211.5 million and our pension assets are valued at $117.2 million. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are $94.3 million at August 28, 2010. These amounts will be amortized into pension expense in the future, unless they are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. Additionally, our tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $46.5 million at August 28, 2010. Approximately $28.4 million is classified as current liabilities and $18.1 million is classified as long term liabilities. We did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of these tax positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 28, 2010: Total Other (in thousands) Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 107,554 Surety bonds 23,723 $ 131,277 A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses. Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures Selected Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value. 25 Table of Contents Non GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year to year operating results. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors use the above mentioned non GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance based compensation.

This ASU addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to enable vendors to account for deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit. This ASU will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into commencing with our first fiscal quarter beginning August 29, 2010. We do not expect the provisions of ASU 2009 13 to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 27 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management: Inventory Reserves and Cost of Sales LIFO We state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for domestic merchandise and the first in, first out (FIFO) method for Mexico inventories. Due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases, our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the FIFO method. We do not write up inventory for favorable LIFO adjustments, and due to price deflation, LIFO costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by $247.3 million at August 28, 2010, calculated using the dollar value method. Inventory Obsolescence and Shrinkage Our inventory, primarily hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products, is used on vehicles that have rather long lives; and therefore, the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit. In the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs, we record a charge (less than $20 million in each of the last three years) through cost of sales for the difference. These charges are based on managements judgment, including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods. Historically, we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory, nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates. However, we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns. Additionally, we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage, which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories. Shrinkage may occur due to theft, loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods, among other things. Throughout the year, we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates. We make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results. Over the last three years, there has been less than a 25 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate. Each quarter, we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results. To the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates, we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements. Historically, we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use. A 10% difference in our inventory reserves as of August 28, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2010. Vendor Allowances We receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for warranties, advertising and general promotion of vendor products. Vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory, unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the Company in selling the vendors products. Approximately 85% of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold. 28 Table of Contents Based on our vendor agreements, a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases. Therefore, we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory. During the year, we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations. We generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them. Historically, we have had minimal write offs (less than $100 thousand in any of the last three years). Self Insurance We retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general and products liability, property and vehicle insurance losses; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. Our self insurance reserve estimates totaled $156 million, $158 million, and $145 million as of the end of fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These changes are primarily reflective of our growing operations, including inflation, increases in vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate. The assumptions made by management in estimating our self insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims, and claims incurred but not yet reported. The actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. When estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends, and projected inflation of related factors. In recent history, we have experienced improvements in frequency and duration of claims; however, medical and wage inflation have partially offset these trends. Throughout this time, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and these trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. Management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. For example, changes in our assumptions about health care costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. For instance, a 10% change in our self insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $10 million for fiscal 2010. As we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. In recent years, we have experienced favorable claims development, particularly related to workers compensation, and have adjusted our estimates as necessary. We attribute this success to programs, such as return to work and projects aimed at accelerating claims closure. The programs have matured and proven to be successful and are therefore considered in our current and future assumptions regarding claims costs. Our liabilities for workers compensation, certain general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long term using the risk free interest rate as of the balance sheet date. If the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points, net income would have changed approximately $2 million for fiscal 2010. Our liability for health benefits is classified as current, as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks. 29 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our income tax returns are audited by state, federal and foreign tax authorities, and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time. Tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation, appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions. We regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded. As of August 28, 2010, we had approximately $46.5 million reserved for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings in accordance with ASC Topic 740 (formerly Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes) by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years; however, actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. Specifically, management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions. Additionally, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or must pay in excess of recognized reserves, our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected. Pension Obligation Prior to January 1, 2003, substantially all full time employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive five year average compensation. On January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. On January 1, 2003, our supplemental, unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. As the plan benefits are frozen, the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels, but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances: Expected long term rate of return on plan assets: We have assumed an 8% long term rate of return on our plan assets. This estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. We review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis, and revise it accordingly. Additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets. At August 28, 2010, our plan assets totaled $117 million in our qualified plan. Our assets are generally valued using the net asset values, which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. We have no assets in our nonqualified plan. A 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense/income by approximately $600 thousand for the qualified plan. Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations: This rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term, high quality, corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. This same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year. For fiscal 2010, we assumed a discount rate of 5.25%. A decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate at August 28, 2010 would impact annual pension expense/income by approximately $2.2 million for the qualified plan and $40 thousand for the nonqualified plan. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks. To date, based upon our current level of foreign operations, no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our Board of Directors. Further, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes. 30 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps. We have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. We reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other. Our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings. At August 28, 2010, we held forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million. These agreements, which expire in November of 2010, are used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates relating to anticipated debt transactions. It is expected that upon settlement of the agreements, the realized gain or loss will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. During fiscal 2009, we terminated an interest rate swap related to a $300 million term loan that was prepaid. As a result, at August 29, 2009, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps. The fair value of our debt was estimated at $3.182 billion as of August 28, 2010, and $2.853 billion as of August 29, 2009, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by $273.5 million and $126.5 million at August 28, 2010 and August 29, 2009, respectively. We had $459.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 28, 2010, and $277.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 29, 2009. In fiscal 2010, at this borrowing level for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of $4.6 million. The primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR. We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $2.449 billion at August 28, 2010, and August 29, 2009. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by $94.2 million at August 28, 2010. Fuel Price Risk Fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure. We did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during the 2010 fiscal year. During fiscal year 2009, we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our unleaded fuel exposure. As of August 29, 2009, we had an outstanding liability of less than one hundred thousand dollars associated with our unleaded fuel swap which had no significant impact on our results of operations. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies. Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material. Our primary foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars. We generally view our investments in the Mexican subsidiaries as long term. As a result, we generally do not hedge these net investments. The net investment in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year end exchange rates was $254.6 million at August 28, 2010 and $215.4 million at August, 29, 2009. The potential loss in value of our net investment in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at August 28, 2010 and August 29, 2009, amounted to $23.1 million and $19.6 million, respectively. Any changes in our net investment in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. During fiscal 2010, exchange rates with respect to the Mexican peso increased by approximately 1.4% with respect to the U.S. dollar. Exchange rates with respect to the Mexican peso decreased by approximately 30% with respect to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009. 31 Table of Contents
