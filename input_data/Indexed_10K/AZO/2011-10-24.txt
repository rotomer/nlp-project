Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are the nations leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. We began operations in 1979 and at August 27, 2011, operated 4,534 stores in the United States, including Puerto Rico, and 279 in Mexico. Each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products. At August 27, 2011, in 2,659 of our domestic stores, we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com and www.alldatadiy.com. Additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services. Executive Summary We achieved strong performance in fiscal 2011, delivering record net income of $849.0 million, a 15.0% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $710.4 million, a 9.6% increase over the prior year. We completed the year with strong growth in our commercial and retail businesses. We are pleased with the results of our retail business and encouraged by the increase in our commercial business, where we continue to build our internal sales force and continue to refine our parts assortment. There are various factors occurring within the current economy that affect both our customers and our industry, including the impact of the recent recession, continued high unemployment and other challenging economic conditions. As consumers cash flows have decreased due to these factors, we believe consumers have become more likely to keep their current vehicles longer and perform repair and maintenance in order to keep those vehicles well maintained. Our belief is supported by industry data showing an increase in the average age of vehicles on the road and declines in new car sales over recent years as compared to historical levels, which we believe have led to an increase in demand for the products that we sell. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future. More recently, we believe changes in gas prices have adversely impacted our customers behavior with respect to driving and maintaining their cars. With approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the United States, each $1 dollar decrease at the pump contributes approximately $11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month. In fiscal 2011, unleaded gas prices increased by $0.95 per gallon, finishing the fourth quarter at $3.63 per gallon (on a national level). During the comparable prior year period, unleaded gas prices increased only $0.07 per gallon finishing the fourth quarter at $2.68 per gallon. We believe the increase in gas prices is reducing discretionary spending for all consumers, and, in particular, our customers. Given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease in the future, nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods. During fiscal 2011, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 83% of total sales, with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers. While we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years, we did experience a slight decline in sales of maintenance and discretionary categories. We believe maintenance and discretionary related products were impacted by higher gas prices during the latter half of the year. We remain focused on refining and expanding our product assortment to ensure we have the best merchandise at the right price in each of our categories. 20 Table of Contents Our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message, store staffing, and product assortment. We continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. Miles Driven We believe that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. Prior to the recession, we had seen a close correlation between annual miles driven and our annual net sales; however, this correlation has not existed in the recessionary period. Since the beginning of the fiscal year and through July 2011 (latest publicly available information), miles driven were relatively flat as compared to the comparable prior year period. Throughout this period and contrary to the correlation experienced prior to the recession, sales have grown at an increased rate, while miles driven have declined or grown at a slower rate than what we have historically experienced. We believe that the impact of changes in other factors, primarily an increase in the average age of vehicles, more than offset the impact of miles driven. Over the long term, we believe that annual miles driven will return to pre recession low single digit growth rates, and the correlation between annual miles driven and the annual sales growth of our industry should return. Seven Year Old or Older Vehicles Since 2008, new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels, which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. We estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12,500 miles each year. In seven years, the average miles driven equates to approximately 87,500 miles. Our experience is that at this point in a vehicles life, most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating. According to data provided by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association, as of December 2010, the average age of vehicles on the road is 10.6 years as compared to 10.3 years as of December 2009. As the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases, we expect an increase in demand for the products that we sell. Although we have seen a slight improvement in new car sales during fiscal 2011, in the near term, we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase, as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy. Results of Operations Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2011, we reported net sales of $8.073 billion compared with $7.363 billion for the year ended August 28, 2010, a 9.6% increase from fiscal 2010. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 6.3% and sales from new stores of $216.8 million. The improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value and, to a lesser extent, higher transaction count trends. Higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to more complex, costly products and commodity price increases. At August 27, 2011, we operated 4,534 domestic stores and 279 stores in Mexico, compared with 4,389 domestic stores and 238 stores in Mexico at August 28, 2010. We reported a domestic retail sales increase of 6.8% and a domestic commercial sales increase of 22.3% for fiscal 2011. Gross profit for fiscal 2011 was $4.119 billion, or 51.0% of net sales, compared with $3.712 billion, or 50.4% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower shrink expense (32 basis points) and higher merchandise margins (26 basis points). Increased penetration of Duralast product sales, as well as retail price increases on commodity based products, drove the higher merchandise margins, which were partially offset by increased penetration of commercial sales. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 increased to $2.625 billion, or 32.5% of net sales, from $2.392 billion, or 32.5% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The slight increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was the result of higher fuel costs (20 basis points) and increased incentive compensation costs (17 basis points), partially offset by leverage due to higher sales volumes. 21 Table of Contents Interest expense, net for fiscal 2011 was $170.6 million compared with $158.9 million during fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period; partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates. Average borrowings for fiscal 2011 were $3.103 billion, compared with $2.752 billion for fiscal 2010 and weighted average borrowing rates were 5.1% for fiscal 2011, compared to 5.3% for fiscal 2010. Our effective income tax rate was 35.9% of pre tax income for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.4% for fiscal 2010. Net income for fiscal 2011 increased by 15.0% to $849.0 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 30.0% to $19.47 from $14.97 in fiscal 2010. The impact of the fiscal 2011 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 was an increase of approximately $1.15. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 For the fiscal year ended August 28, 2010, we reported net sales of $7.363 billion compared with $6.817 billion for the year ended August 29, 2009, an 8.0% increase from fiscal 2009. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 5.4% and sales from new stores of $203.4 million. The improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends, while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our long term trends. Higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex, costly products and commodity price increases. At August 28, 2010, we operated 4,389 domestic stores and 238 stores in Mexico, compared with 4,229 domestic stores and 188 stores in Mexico at August 29, 2009. We reported a domestic retail sales increase of 6.9% and a domestic commercial sales increase of 13.8% for fiscal 2010. Gross profit for fiscal 2010 was $3.712 billion, or 50.4% of net sales, compared with $3.416 billion, or 50.1% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to leveraging distribution costs due to higher sales and operating efficiencies (19 basis points). Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 increased to $2.392 billion, or 32.5% of net sales, from $2.240 billion, or 32.9% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The reduction in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales, partially offset by higher pension expense (17 basis points) and the continued investment in the hub store initiative (16 basis points). Interest expense, net for fiscal 2010 was $158.9 million compared with $142.3 million during fiscal 2009. This increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period. Average borrowings for fiscal 2010 were $2.752 billion, compared with $2.460 billion for fiscal 2009 and weighted average borrowing rates were 5.3% for fiscal 2010, compared to 5.4% for fiscal 2009. Our effective income tax rate was 36.4% of pre tax income for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.4% for fiscal 2009. Net income for fiscal 2010 increased by 12.4% to $738.3 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 27.6% to $14.97 from $11.73 in fiscal 2009. The impact of the fiscal 2010 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 was an increase of approximately $0.74. Seasonality and Quarterly Periods Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of February through September, in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months of December and January. During short periods of time, a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail; thereby increasing sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales, as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather, with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico. 22 Table of Contents Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2011, 2010, and 2009. Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 represented 32.7% of annual sales and 35.5% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 represented 33.2% of annual sales and 36.4% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 represented 32.7% of annual sales and 35.9% of net income. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.292 billion in fiscal 2011, $1.196 billion in fiscal 2010, and $923.8 million in fiscal 2009. The increase over prior year was primarily due to higher net income of $110.7 million and timing of income tax deductions, offset by inventory purchases. During fiscal 2011, cash flows from operating activities continue to benefit from our inventory purchases being financed by our vendors. The increase in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the growth in net income and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors financed a large portion of our inventory. We had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 112% at August 27, 2011, 106% at August 28, 2010, and 96% at August 29, 2009. Our inventory increases are primarily attributable to an increased number of stores and to a lesser extent, our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores. Many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms. These extended payment terms have allowed us to continue to grow accounts payable at a faster rate than inventory. Our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued new store development program. From the beginning of fiscal 2009 to August 27, 2011, we have opened 581 new stores. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $319.0 million in fiscal 2011, compared to $307.4 million in fiscal 2010, and $263.7 million in fiscal 2009. We invested $321.6 million in capital assets in fiscal 2011, compared to $315.4 million in capital assets in fiscal 2010, and $272.2 million in capital assets in fiscal 2009. The increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores. New store openings were 188 for fiscal 2011, 213 for fiscal 2010, and 180 for fiscal 2009. We invest a portion of our assets held by the Companys wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities. We acquired $43.8 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2011, $56.2 million in fiscal 2010, and $48.4 million in fiscal 2009. We had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $43.1 million in fiscal 2011, $52.6 million in fiscal 2010, and $46.3 million in fiscal 2009. Capital asset disposals provided $3.3 million in fiscal 2011, $11.5 million in fiscal 2010, and $10.7 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $973.8 million in fiscal 2011, $883.5 million in fiscal 2010, and $806.9 million in fiscal 2009. The net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled $1.467 billion for fiscal 2011, $1.124 billion for fiscal 2010, and $1.300 billion for fiscal 2009. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations, and at times, by increases in debt levels. Proceeds from issuance of debt were $500.0 million for fiscal 2011; there were no debt issuances in fiscal 2010 and $500.0 million for fiscal 2009. Repayments of debt for fiscal 2011 were $199.3 million; there were no debt repayments for fiscal 2010, and $300.7 million for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2011, we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay our $199.3 million term loan in November 2010, to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, store openings and stock repurchases. Proceeds from the debt issuance in fiscal 2009, were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness, to prepay our $300.0 million term loan in August 2009 and for general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, store openings and stock repurchases. Net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowings were $141.5 million for fiscal 2011, $181.6 million for fiscal 2010 and $277.6 million for fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2012, we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2011, and more consistent with growth rates experienced in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Our investment is expected to be directed primarily to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure. The amount of our investments in our new store program is impacted by different factors, including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment), located in the United States or Mexico, or located in urban or rural areas. During fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and 23 Table of Contents fiscal 2009, our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 2%, 16% and 12%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Our mix of store openings has moved away from build to suit leases (lower initial capital investment) to ground leases and land purchases (higher initial capital investment), resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years, and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending August 25, 2012. In addition to the building and land costs, our new store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us. Certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us, allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate. Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past. For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2011, our after tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 31.3% as compared to 27.6% for the comparable prior year period. ROIC is calculated as after tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by average invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). ROIC increased primarily due to increased after tax operating profit. We use ROIC to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. Debt Facilities In September 2011, we amended and restated our $800 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2012. The capacity under the revolving credit facility was increased to $1.0 billion. This credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short term, unsecured bank loans. The capacity of the credit facility may be increased to $1.250 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval, may include up to $200 million in letters of credit, and may include up to $175 million in capital leases each fiscal year. Under the revolving credit facility, we may borrow funds consisting of Eurodollar loans or base rate loans. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate, defined as the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus the applicable percentage, as defined in the revolving credit facility, depending upon our senior, unsecured, (non credit enhanced) long term debt rating. Interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility. We also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility. The revolving credit facility expires in September 2016. The revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.50:1. This ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of August 27, 2011 was 4.44:1. As the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit, we had $200.7 million in available capacity under our previous revolving credit facility at August 27, 2011. Assuming the amended and restated revolving credit facility had been executed as of our balance sheet date, we would have had $400.7 million in available capacity under the facility at August 27, 2011. In June 2010, we entered into a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $100 million. The letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit facility. As of August 27, 2011, we have $92.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility, which expires in June 2013. 24 Table of Contents On November 15, 2010, we issued $500 million in 4.000% Senior Notes due 2020 under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2008 (the Shelf Registration). The Shelf Registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. During November 2010, we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay the principal due relating to the $199.3 million in 4.750% Senior Notes that matured on November 15, 2010, to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. The 5.750% Senior Notes issued in July 2009 and the 6.500% and 7.125% Senior Notes issued during August 2008, (collectively, the Notes), are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the Notes are downgraded. The Notes, along with the 4.000% Senior Notes issued in during November 2010, also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. Under our revolving credit facility, covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. These covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. As of August 27, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future. For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2011, our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share based compensation expense (EBITDAR) ratio was 2.4:1 as compared to 2.4:1 as of the comparable prior year end. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, capital lease obligations and rent times six; and we calculate EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share based compensation expense to net income. We target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. We believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels. Stock Repurchases During 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our Board of Directors (the Board). The program was amended in June 2011 to increase the repurchase authorization to $10.4 billion from $9.9 billion. From January 1998 to August 27, 2011, we have repurchased a total of 127.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $10.2 billion. We repurchased 5.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.467 billion during fiscal 2011, 6.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.124 billion during fiscal 2010, and 9.3 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.300 billion during fiscal 2009. Considering cumulative repurchases as of August 27, 2011, we have $218.6 million remaining under the Board of Directors authorization to repurchase our common stock. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2011, the Board voted to increase the authorization by $750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from $10.4 billion to $11.15 billion. We have repurchased approximately 527 thousand shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $169.7 million during fiscal 2012. 25 Table of Contents Financial Commitments The following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of August 27, 2011: Total Payment Due by Period Contractual Less than Between Between Over (in thousands) Obligations 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Long term debt (1) $ 3,317,600 $ 567,600 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 750,000 Interest payments (2) 684,282 155,870 260,237 142,550 125,625 Operating leases (3) 1,851,453 209,778 382,786 309,983 948,906 Capital leases (4) 89,649 25,296 47,043 17,310 Self insurance reserves (5) 163,267 55,896 44,687 24,093 38,591 Construction commitments 23,851 23,851 $ 6,130,102 $ 1,038,291 $ 1,734,753 $ 1,493,936 $ 1,863,122 (1) Long term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. (2) Represents obligations for interest payments on long term debt. (3) Operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. (4) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (5) Self insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our consolidated balance sheets. We have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account. During fiscal 2011, we made contributions of $34.1 million to the pension plan. We expect to make contributions of approximately $7 million during fiscal 2012; however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets. As of August 27, 2011, our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is $241.6 million and our pension assets are valued at $156.9 million, resulting in a net pension obligation of $84.8 million. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are $107.0 million at August 27, 2011. The balance in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future, unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. Additionally, our tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $35.1 million at August 27, 2011. Approximately $8.2 million is classified as current liabilities and $26.9 million is classified as long term liabilities. We did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of these tax positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 27, 2011: Total Other (in thousands) Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 96,594 Surety bonds 26,335 $ 122,929 A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses. 26 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures Selected Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value. Non GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year to year operating results. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board use the above mentioned non GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following reconciliation tables.

ASU 2010 28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment analysis if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists based on a qualitative assessment of adverse factors. We do not expect the provisions of ASU 2010 28 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. This update will be effective for our fiscal year ending August 25, 2012. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which amends ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. The purpose of ASU 2011 04 is to clarify the intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and to change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. We do not expect the provisions of ASU 2011 04 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. This update will be effective as of our third quarter ending May 5, 2012. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income. The objective of ASU 2011 05 is to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The update will require entities to present items of net income, items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements, and entities will no longer be allowed to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity. Reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income will be presented separately on the face of the financial statements. We do not expect the provisions of ASU 2011 05 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. This update will be effective for our fiscal year ending August 31, 2013. In August 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, which amends ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The purpose of ASU 2011 08 is to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. Entities will assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value. In instances where the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, entities will perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We do not expect the provisions of ASU 2011 08 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. This update will be effective for our fiscal year ending August 31, 2013. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the Audit Committee of our Board. The following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management: Inventory Reserves and Cost of Sales LIFO We state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for domestic merchandise and the first in, first out (FIFO) method for Mexico inventories. Due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases, our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the FIFO method. We do not write up inventory for favorable LIFO adjustments, and due to price deflation, LIFO costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by $253.3 million at August 27, 2011, calculated using the dollar value method. 29 Table of Contents Inventory Obsolescence and Shrinkage Our inventory, primarily hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non automotive products, is used on vehicles that have rather long lives; and therefore, the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit. In the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs, we record a charge (less than $20 million in each of the last three years) through cost of sales for the difference. These charges are based on managements judgment, including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods. Historically, we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory, nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates. However, we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns. Additionally, we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage, which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories. Shrinkage may occur due to theft, loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods, among other things. Throughout the year, we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates. We make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results. Over the last three years, there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate. Each quarter, we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results. To the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates, we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements. Historically, we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use. A 10% difference in our inventory reserves as of August 27, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2011. Vendor Allowances We receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for warranties, advertising and general promotion of vendor products. Vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory, unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the Company in selling the vendors products. Approximately 87% of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold. Based on our vendor agreements, a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases. Therefore, we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory. During the year, we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations. We generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them. Historically, we have had minimal write offs (less than $500 thousand in any of the last three years). Self Insurance Reserves We retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general and products liability, property and vehicle liability; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. Our self insurance reserve estimates totaled $159.3 million at August 27, 2011, and $156.0 million at August 28, 2010. This change is primarily reflective of our growing operations, including inflation, increases in vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate. 30 Table of Contents The assumptions made by management in estimating our self insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims, and claims incurred but not yet reported. The actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. When estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends, and projected inflation of related factors. In recent history, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. Management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. For example, changes in our assumptions about health care costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. For instance, a 10% change in our self insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $10 million for fiscal 2011. As we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. In fiscal 2011, we have experienced favorable claims development in our older policy years, partially offset by increased severity and frequency of claims in the current policy year, and have adjusted our estimates as necessary. Prior to fiscal 2011, we experienced favorable claims development, particularly related to workers compensation claims. We attribute this success to programs, such as return to work, and projects aimed at accelerating claims closure. The programs have matured and proven to be effective and are therefore considered in our current and future assumptions regarding claims costs. Our liabilities for workers compensation, certain general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long term using the risk free interest rate as of the balance sheet date. If the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points, net income would have been affected by approximately $2 million for fiscal 2011. Our liability for health benefits is classified as current, as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks. Income Taxes Our income tax returns are audited by state, federal and foreign tax authorities, and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time. Tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation, appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions. We regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded. As of August 27, 2011, we had approximately $35.1 million reserved for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years; however, actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. Specifically, management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions. Additionally, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or must pay in excess of recognized reserves, our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected. 31 Table of Contents Pension Obligation Prior to January 1, 2003, substantially all full time employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive five year average compensation. On January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. On January 1, 2003, our supplemental, unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. As the plan benefits are frozen, the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels, but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances: Expected long term rate of return on plan assets: For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2011, we have assumed an 8% long term rate of return on our plan assets. This estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. We review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis, and revise it accordingly. Additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets. For the fiscal year ending August 25, 2012, we expect to assume a long term rate of return on our plan assets of 7.5% due to a change in our asset allocation. At August 27, 2011, our plan assets totaled $157 million in our qualified plan. Our assets are generally valued using the net asset values, which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. We have no assets in our nonqualified plan. A 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense/income by approximately $780 thousand for the qualified plan. Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations: This rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term, high quality, corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. This same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year. For fiscal 2011, we assumed a discount rate of 5.13%. A decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate at August 27, 2011 would impact annual pension expense/income by approximately $2 million for the qualified plan and $30 thousand for the nonqualified plan. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks. To date, based upon our current level of foreign operations, no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the Board. Further, we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps. We have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. We reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other. Our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders deficit as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings. 32 Table of Contents As of August 28, 2010, we held two forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended August 28, 2010, we entered into a third forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $100 million, bringing the total notional amount of all outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps to $400 million. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the $500 million Senior Note debt issuance during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The swaps were benchmarked based on the 3 month LIBOR. The three forward starting interest rate swaps expired in November 2010 and resulted in a loss of $7.4 million, net of tax, which has been deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. The hedges remained highly effective until they expired; therefore, no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings. At August 27, 2011, we had no outstanding interest rate hedge instruments. The fair value of our debt was estimated at $3.633 billion as of August 27, 2011, and $3.182 billion as of August 28, 2010, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by $281.0 million and $273.5 million at August 27, 2011 and August 28, 2010, respectively. We had $601.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 27, 2011, and $459.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 28, 2010. In fiscal 2011, at this borrowing level for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of approximately $6 million. The primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR. We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $2.750 billion at August 27, 2011, and $2.449 billion at August 28, 2010. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $112 million at August 27, 2011. Fuel Price Risk From time to time, we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results. Historically, the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure. However, we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments; and therefore, the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment. We did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010. During fiscal year 2009, we used a derivative financial instrument to economically hedge the commodity cost associated with our unleaded fuel. The notional amount of the contract was 2.5 million gallons and terminated August 31, 2009. The loss on the fuel contract for fiscal 2009 was $2.3 million. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities functional currencies. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies. Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material. Our primary foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars. We generally view our investments in the Mexican subsidiaries as long term. As a result, we generally do not hedge these net investments. The net investment in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year end exchange rates was $292.2 million at August 27, 2011 and $254.6 million at August, 28, 2010. The potential loss in value of our net investment in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at August 27, 2011 and August 28, 2010, amounted to approximately $27 million and approximately $23 million, respectively. Any changes in our net investment in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. During fiscal 2011, exchange rates with respect to the Mexican peso increased by approximately 4.3% with respect to the U.S. dollar. Exchange rates with respect to the Mexican peso increased by approximately 1.4% with respect to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2010. 33 Table of Contents
