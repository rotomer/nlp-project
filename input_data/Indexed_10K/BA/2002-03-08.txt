Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Information required by this item is included on pages 39 58 of the Companys 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally short term investments, fixed rate notes receivable attributable to customer financing, and debt obligations issued at a fixed rate. Historically, the Company has not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes when selling short term investments or fixed rate notes receivable. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the current holdings of short term investments and fixed rate notes, as well as underlying swaps, the exposure to interest rate risk is not material. Fixed rate debt obligations issued by the Company are generally not callable until maturity. The Company is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. As a general policy, the Company substantially hedges foreign currency commitments of future payments and receipts by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts. Less than two percent of receipts and expenditures are contracted in foreign currencies, and the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange is not material. For further information on quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Note 1 on pages 59 61 and Notes 23 26 on pages 75 77 of the Companys 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders.
