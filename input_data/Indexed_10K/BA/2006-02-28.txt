Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacturing, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second largest defense contractor in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world. Our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses Commercial Airplanes and Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services and to open new frontiers in aerospace. We are focused on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS is a defense systems business that integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications and space to deliver capability driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to overlay the strong positions in Commercial Airplanes and IDS with a simultaneously intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others cyclicality. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and reducing our customer financing exposures. Boeing Technology, our advanced research and development unit, provides new systems, technologies and processes to position us for future growth. Connexion by BoeingSM makes an airplane seem more like the office or home with internet connection anytime and anywhere. Our financial results improved significantly in 2005 over 2004. Revenues grew by 5 percent, operating earnings grew by 40%, operating margin increased by 1.3 percentage points and fully diluted earnings per share grew by 39%. We continued to invest in key growth programs and Research and Development expense grew by 17% to $2.2 billion, primarily reflecting increased spending on our new 787 aircraft. We generated operating cash flow of $7.0 billion after contributing $1.9 billion to our pension plans. We reduced debt by $1.5 billion and repurchased more than 45 million shares. Our contractual backlog grew 46% to $160 billion, driven by 76% growth at Commercial Airplanes while our total backlog grew 30% to $205 billion. Our major businesses delivered strong performance in 2005. Commercial Airplanes grew revenues by 8% to $22.7 billion while operating earnings increased by 90% to $1.4 billion or 6.3% of revenues compared with operating margins of 3.6% of revenues in 2004. IDS revenues grew by 1% to a record $30.8 billion, operating earnings increased 33% to $3.9 billion and operating earnings as a percent of revenues were 12.6% in 2005 up from 9.6% in 2004. A gain of $569 million from the sale of Rocketdyne in 2005 increased IDS operating margin by 1.8%. BCC grew revenue by 1% and increased operating earnings by 27%. The operating earnings growth at our major businesses was partially offset by higher expenses for pension and share based plans. We expect strong growth in Commercial Airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand. We are ramping up commercial aircraft production and are focused on successfully executing our backlog. We expect IDS revenue growth to moderate as we anticipate that the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) budget will remain relatively flat over the next several years. We are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer focused growth. 19 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues Higher consolidated revenues in 2005 were primarily due to the growth at Commercial Airplanes driven by higher new aircraft deliveries, increased spares and aircraft modifications, and higher used aircraft sales. IDS revenues remained stable in 2005 after strong growth in 2004. BCC revenues were essentially unchanged in 2005. Consolidated revenues also increased in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase was driven by strong growth at IDS defense and intelligence businesses. Despite increased new aircraft deliveries, Commercial Airplanes revenues declined in 2004. The decline is primarily due to delivery mix as more single aisle aircraft and fewer twin aisle aircraft were delivered in 2004. BCC revenues were down slightly in 2004. Operating Earnings Our 2005 operating earnings increased primarily due to strong operating performance by our business segments, which are discussed in the Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition on page 27, partially offset by higher pension and share based plan expenses. Sharply higher operating earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 were primarily due to higher operating earnings by IDS. Included in 2004 results is a charge of $555 million related to the United States Air Force (USAF) 767 tanker program and expenses incurred to end production of the 717 aircraft. Included in 2003 results are goodwill impairment charges of $572 million recorded at IDS and $341 million recorded at Commercial Airplanes. In addition, 2003 earnings were further impacted by a second quarter charge of $1,030 million, of which $835 million was attributable to the Delta IV program and $195 million to Boeing Satellite Systems incurring additional costs as a result of satellite program complexities. The following table shows operating earnings and corporate items not allocated to our segments: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Commercial Airplanes $ 1,432 $ 753 $ 707 Integrated Defense Systems 3,890 2,925 766 Boeing Capital Corporation 232 183 91 Other segment (334 ) (535 ) (379 ) Items not allocated to segments (2,408 ) (1,319 ) (787 ) Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,812 $ 2,007 $ 398 The most significant items not allocated to segments are shown in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Pension and post retirement (expense)/income $ (851 ) $ (258 ) $ 206 Share based plans expense (852 ) (576 ) (456 ) Deferred compensation expense (265 ) (72 ) (68 ) Other (440 ) (413 ) (469 ) Total items not allocated to segments $ (2,408 ) $ (1,319 ) $ (787 ) Pension and other post retirement accounting differences represent difference between costs recognized under GAAP in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. Higher pension and post retirement amounts in 2005 are primarily related to higher amortization of actuarial losses and net settlement and curtailment losses due to 2005 divestitures. The increase in 2004 from 2003 is due to higher GAAP pension expense in 2004 reflecting higher amortization of 20 Table of Contents actuarial losses. The increase in 2005 share based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock. The increase in 2005 deferred compensation plans expense is also due to the increase in our stock price. Income Taxes The 2005 effective income tax rate of 9.1% differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 1998 2001, Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extraterritorial Income (ETI) tax benefits, reversal of valuation allowances, and other provision adjustments. The 2004 effective income tax rate of 7.1% differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to FSC and ETI tax benefits, tax benefits from a settlement with the IRS for the years 1986 1997, tax benefits associated with state tax audit settlements, and other provision adjustments. For further discussion related to Income Taxes see Note 5. Net Earnings Net earnings increased in 2005 compared to 2004 largely due to higher operating earnings. Interest and debt expense was lower as we continued to pay down our debt in 2005. Net earnings increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher operating earnings which was partially offset by lower other income and higher income taxes. Additionally, included in 2004 net earnings is a $42 million net gain on BCCs sale of a substantial portion of its Commercial Financial Services business. Other income primarily consists of interest income. Other income included interest of $100 million in 2005, $219 million in 2004 and $397 million in 2003 related to federal income tax settlements for prior years. Additionally in 2005, other income included higher income from marketable securities and an asset impairment charge for certain investments in technology related funds and partnerships. We early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R as of January 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recorded an increase in net earnings of $21 million, net of taxes of $12 million, as a cumulative effect of accounting change. For Performance Shares awarded in 2005, the fair value of each award is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model instead of the grant date market price used for previous awards. Additionally, we now amortize compensation cost for share based awards granted after January 1, 2005 for retirement eligible employees using the non substantive vesting approach instead of amortizing over the stated vesting period (See Note 18). Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and foreign government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog from 2004 to 2005 primarily relates to new orders for the 737, 777, and 787. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in IDS contractual backlog. The increase in contractual backlog from 2003 to 2004 related primarily to new orders for the 777 and 787. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in IDS contractual backlog. 21 Table of Contents Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and foreign government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2005 is mainly due to strong sales in C 17 and F 15 programs for multi year contracts awarded in prior years. For segment reporting purposes, we include airplanes ordered by other segments in Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog. Commercial Airplanes relieves contractual backlog upon delivery of these airplanes to other segments. IDS contractual backlog includes modifications to be performed on intracompany airplane purchases from Commercial Airplanes. IDS contractual backlog is reduced upon delivery to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary sources of our liquidity and capital resources include cash flow from operations and substantial unused borrowing capacity through commercial paper programs, long term capital markets and revolving credit line agreements. The primary factors that affect our investment requirements and liquidity position, other than operating results associated with current sales activity, include the following: timing of new and derivative aircraft programs requiring both high developmental expenditures and initial inventory buildup; growth and contractions in business cycles; customer financing assistance; the timing of federal income tax payments/refunds and contributions to our pension plans as well as interest, debt and dividend payments; our stock repurchase plan; internal investments; and acquisitions and divestitures. Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net earnings $ 2,572 $ 1,872 $ 718 Non cash items 3,310 3,047 3,137 Changes in working capital 1,118 (1,415) (1,079) Net cash provided by operating activities 7,000 3,504 2,776 Net cash (used)/ provided by investing activities (98 ) (1,446 ) 60 Net cash used by financing activities (4,657) (3,487) (536) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (37 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2,208 (1,429 ) 2,300 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 3,204 4,633 2,333 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 5,412 $ 3,204 $ 4,633 Non cash items Non cash items in earnings primarily include depreciation, share based plans expense, impairments, pension expense, and gains/losses on dispositions. Corresponding amounts are listed in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Working capital During the year ended December 31, 2005, our investment in working capital decreased. This decrease is primarily due to the following: lower pension contributions in 2005 compared to 2004, decreased investment in customer financing, and higher advances and billings in excess of related costs. These decreases in working capital were partially offset by increased investment in inventories. 22 Table of Contents Working capital includes customer financing transactions primarily in the form of notes receivable, sales type/finance leases and property subject to operating leases. These transactions occur as the result of customer financing activities associated with items recorded in inventory. The origination and subsequent principal collections for some of these transactions were previously presented as investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consistent with the presentation by BCC in their stand alone financial statements. Effective for the year ended December 31, 2004, we changed the classification of the cash flow effects of customer financing transactions based on views expressed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff. The amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with current year presentation. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the net impact on operating cash flow was $589 million, ($421) million and ($1.3) billion, respectively, for customer financing transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received federal income tax refunds totaling $738 million (of which $145 million represents interest). These refunds related to the settlement of federal income tax audits for the 1987 2001 tax years. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we contributed $1.9 billion and $4.4 billion to our pension plans which are included in operating cash flow. Almost all of the 2005 and 2004 contributions were voluntary to improve the funded status of our plans. Investing activities In 2005, cash used for investing activities decreased by $1.3 billion compared to 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher net contributions in 2004 to investment grade fixed income securities partially offset by lower proceeds from business dispositions in 2005 and higher Property, plant and equipment additions in 2005. During 2004, we invested $3.0 billion of cash in an externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments. The portfolio is diversified and highly liquid and primarily consists of investment fixed income instruments (U.S. dollar debt obligations of the United States Treasury, other government agencies, corporations, mortgage backed and asset backed securities). As of December 31, 2005, the portfolio had an average duration of 1.6 years. We do not intend to hold these investments to maturity, nor do we intend to actively and frequently buy and sell these securities with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in price. During 2005, we received $1.7 billion of cash proceeds from dispositions. This is primarily related to the sale of our Commercial Airplanes operations in Wichita, Kansas, and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma and the sale of Rocketdyne. During 2004, we received cash of $2.0 billion from the sale of a substantial portion of BCCs Commercial Financial Services business. Property, plant and equipment additions increased by approximately $0.3 billion to $1.5 billion in 2005. Financing activities Cash used by financing activities increased to $4.6 billion in 2005 from $3.5 billion in 2004 primarily due to a $2.1 billion increase in share repurchases partially offset by lower debt repayments. During 2005, we repurchased 45,217,300 shares at an average price of $63.60 pursuant to our open market share repurchase program, and 33,360 shares in stock swaps. During 2004, 14,708,856 shares were repurchased at an average price of $51.09 pursuant to our open market share repurchase program, and 50,657 shares were repurchased in stock swaps. There were no share repurchases in 2003. There were no debt issuances during 2005 and 2004. We issued approximately $1 billion of debt in 2003 to refinance corporate debt that matured in 2002 and 2003. Additionally, in 2003, we received proceeds of $1 billion under our September 13, 2002 shelf registration. On July 26, 2004, BCC redeemed $1 billion face value of its outstanding senior notes, which had a carrying value of $999 million. BCC recognized a net loss of $42 million related to this early debt redemption (See Note 16). Debt maturities were $1.3 billion in 2005, $1.1 billion in 2004, and $1.8 billion in 2003. 23 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moodys Standard &Poors Long term: Boeing/BCC A+ A3 A Short term: Boeing/BCC F 1 P 2 A 1 On January 25, 2006, Moodys placed both Boeing and BCCs credit ratings (Senior Unsecured Long term ratings and Short term ratings) under review for possible upgrade. Capital Resources We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity. Throughout 2005 and at December 31, 2005, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We believe we have substantial borrowing capacity. Currently, we have $3.0 billion ($1.5 billion exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing limits under revolving credit line agreements. (See Note 16). In November 2005, we rolled over the 364 day revolving credit facility, reducing it from $2.0 billion to $1.5 billion. Currently, there is $750 million allocated to BCC. We also rolled over the 5 year credit facility we established in November 2003, maintaining the total size of $1.5 billion, of which $750 million remains allocated to BCC. We also have $1.0 billion that remains available from a shelf registration filed with the SEC on March 23, 2004 and BCC has an additional $3.4 billion available for issuance. We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. 24 Table of Contents Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2005, and the estimated timing thereof. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 13years 35years After 5years Long term debt (including current portion) $ 10,489 $ 1,136 $ 2,018 $ 1,194 $ 6,141 Interest on debt* 6,859 638 1,067 913 4,241 Capital lease obligations 210 53 87 18 52 Operating lease obligations 1,995 283 381 260 1,071 Purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position: Production related 58,532 24,599 22,060 9,169 2,704 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 6,847 629 1,349 1,446 3,423 Purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position 7,952 6,625 455 467 405 Total contractual obligations $ 92,884 $ 33,963 $ 27,417 $ 13,467 $ 18,037 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2005. Variable rate debt was approximately 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2005. Purchase obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without a substantial penalty. Long term debt, interest on debt, capital leases, and operating leases are shown in the above table regardless of whether they meet the characteristics of purchase obligations. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 24% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts. Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Pension and other postretirement benefits Pension cash requirements is an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to the ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contribution to the one plan that is funded through a trust. Production related Production related purchase obligations include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises due to the extended production planning horizon for many of our products, including commercial aircraft, military aircraft and other products where 25 Table of Contents delivery to the customer occurs over an extended period of time. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts from customers, and or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from such customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial participation agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers in foreign countries to effect economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies, as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology, or other forms of assistance to the foreign country. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our foreign customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2005, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2005, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $6.3 billion that extend through 2019. In cases where we satisfy our commitments through the purchase of supplies and the criteria described in purchase obligations are met, amounts are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, the foreign country or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 21. Commercial commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2005, as well as an estimate of when these commitments are expected to expire. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 3,957 $ 3,719 $ 112 $ $ 126 Aircraft financing commercial commitments 13,496 872 6,672 1,997 3,955 Total commercial commitments $ 17,453 $ 4,591 $ 6,784 $ 1,997 $ 4,081 Related to the issuance of certain standby letters of credit and surety bonds included in the above table, we received advance payments of $274 million as of December 31, 2005. 26 Table of Contents Aircraft financing commercial commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option for deliveries scheduled through the year 2012. Based on historical experience, it is not anticipated that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers. (See Note 21). Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita, Kansas and Fulton County, Georgia to finance the purchase and or construction of real and personal property (See Note 21). Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the primary driver of air traffic growth, remained resilient in the face of rising energy prices in 2005. As a result, worldwide passenger traffic growth continued above the long term trend in 2005 following double digit growth in 2004. Traffic growth outpaced capacity increases pushing world load factors to historical highs. Industry forecasts predict above average traffic growth through at least 2007, although disease outbreaks, increasing armed conflict or terrorist attacks, and global economic imbalances represent ongoing risks. Crude oil prices have almost doubled since the beginning of 2004. In addition, the price differential between oil and jet fuel rose to historically high levels in 2005, triple the average over the last 20 years. Although economic indicators show that the world economy has adjusted to the current higher oil price levels without significant slowdown, the rise in jet fuel prices is outpacing airlines ability to increase revenues through fare hikes and fuel surcharges and is pressuring less efficient airlines in particular. Worldwide, many airlines continue to report operating profits although performance varies significantly by region and business model. Industry financials generally show increasing unit revenues and some improvement in fares. Combined with progress on cost cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements, these trends are helping many airlines remain profitable despite rising fuel prices and intense competition. Although the industrys aggregate financial health remains under the shadow of the U.S. network carriers whose financial difficulties are forecast to push the industry into losses of $6 billion in 2005, the many airlines that are profitably growing to meet increased demand are acquiring new capacity from manufacturers. The pace of air traffic rights liberalization between countries has been brisk during the past year with many new air service agreements having been signed or announced. High growth markets including China and India announced multiple new agreements spurring the opening of new routes. In addition, the United States and European Union made significant advances towards open skies late in 2005. Continued liberalization is an important factor in the growth and network development of commercial aviation. Looking forward, our 20 year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger traffic, and 6% per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth of 3%. Based on long term global economic growth projections, and factoring in the increasingly competitive environment, increasing utilization levels of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $2.1 trillion market for 25,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years. While factors such as terrorism and increased ticket charges for security have had significant impact over the span of several years, they have not historically affected the longer term macro trends in the world economy, and therefore, our long term market outlook. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields 27 Table of Contents worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns. Approximately two thirds of Commercial Airplanes third party sales and contractual backlog are from customers based outside the United States. We face aggressive international competitors that are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100 seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. The decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies in 2004 put pressure on competitors revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs, thereby improving their longer term competitive posture. Airbus is implementing such initiatives targeting more than 10% reduction in costs by 2006. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen as it has in 2005, Airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network for airlines throughout the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins. While we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction activities, events may occur that will prevent us from achieving planned results. We continue to explore strategic options related to our operations at various sites to focus on large scale systems integration, which is where we are most competitive and can add the most value to our airplanes and services. Production Disruption Caused by Labor Strike We delivered 29 fewer than expected airplanes due to the IAM strike, during 2005. This reduced revenue by approximately $2 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. New Airline Bankruptcies Northwest Airlines, Inc. (Northwest) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Commercial Airplanes does not expect a material impact on revenues or operating results due to these bankruptcy filings. (See Note 10). Divestitures On June 16, 2005 we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets at our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma under an asset purchase agreement to a new entity, which was subsequently named Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. (Spirit) and is owned by Onex Partners LP. (See Note 8). 28 Table of Contents Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 22,651 $ 21,037 $ 22,408 % of Total Company Revenues 41 % 40 % 44 % Operating Earnings $ 1,432 $ 753 $ 707 Operating Margins 6.3 % 3.6 % 3.2 % Research and Development $ 1,302 $ 941 $ 676 Contractual Backlog* $ 124,132 $ 70,449 $ 63,929 * Note: Commercial Airplanes backlog at December 31, 2005 has been reduced by $7.8 billion to reflect the planned change in accounting for concessions effective January 1, 2006. Had December 31, 2004 reflected this method of accounting, Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog would have been reduced by $4.9 billion to $65.5 billion. See Note 1. Revenues The increase in revenue of approximately $1.6 billion in 2005 from 2004 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries including model mix changes of $1.0 billion, used airplane sales of $302 million and aircraft modification, spares and other of $300 million. The decline in revenue of $1.4 billion in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to new airplane model mix of $1.2 billion and net reductions of $132 million in other products. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: Model 2005 2004 2003 717 13 (5) 12 (6) 12 (11) 737 Next Generation 212 * 202 * 173 * 747 13 15 19 (1) 757 2 11 14 767 10 * 9 (1) 24 (5) 777 40 36 39 Total 290 285 281 * Intracompany deliveries were two 767 aircraft and two 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2005, three 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2004 and three 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2003 The cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2005 2004 2003 717 150 137 125 737 Next Generation 1,834 1,622 1,420 747 1,366 1,353 1,338 757 1,049 1,047 1,036 767 935 925 916 777 539 499 463 29 Table of Contents The undelivered units under firm order* as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2005 2004 2003 717 5 18 22 737 Next Generation 1,123 771 800 747 58 27 32 757 2 13 767 30 25 25 777 288 167 159 787 287 52 * Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its Board of Directors, shareholders, government and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights. Operating earnings The $679 million increase in operating earnings in 2005 over the comparable period of 2004 was primarily attributable to earnings on increased revenue from new aircraft deliveries of $265 million and increased revenue from aircraft modification and other of $128 million. In addition, margin improved $414 million mainly due to improved cost performance, which was offset by increased research and development costs of $361 million and other period costs of $174 million, and a loss on the sale of Wichita, Tulsa and McAlester operations of $68 million. In 2004, we also had charges of $280 million resulting from the decision to complete production of the 717 program and $195 million of 767 USAF Tanker program charge. Refer to IDS Discussion on page 37. The increase of $46 million in operating earnings in 2004 from 2003 was primarily attributable to $466 million from improved program margins due to cost reduction initiatives and decreased period costs offset by lower earnings from the change in model mix of $205 million, 717 program termination charge of $280 million, 767 USAF Tanker program charge of $195 million and increased research and development expense of $265 million. Additionally, in 2003 we had a goodwill impairment charge of $341 million and a charge of $184 million resulting from the decision to complete production of the 757 program. Backlog The increase in backlog in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily relates to new orders for the 737, 777 and 787. The increase in backlog in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily related to new orders for 777 and 787. Accounting Quantity For each airplane program, we estimate the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. We refer to this estimate as the accounting quantity. The accounting quantity for each program is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout the life of a program. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Program accounting. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review and reassess our program accounting quantities on a quarterly basis in compliance with relevant program accounting guidance. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting 30 Table of Contents quantity decreases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. The estimate of total program accounting quantities and changes, if any, as of December 31 were: 717 737 Next Generation 747 757 767 777 2005 156 2,800 1,424 1,050 971 800 Additions 400 24 12 100 2004 156 2,400 1,400 1,050 959 700 Additions/(deletions) 8 200 12 (16 ) 50 2003 148 2,200 1,388 1,050 975 650 The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be addressed. The percentage of anticipated orders included in the program accounting estimates as compared to the number of cumulative firm orders* as of December 31 were as follows: 717 737 Next Generation 747 757 767 777 2005 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 155 2,957 1,424 1,049 965 827 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 3 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 0 % N/A 2004 Cumulative firm orders 155 2,393 1,380 1,049 950 666 Anticipated orders N/A 5 19 N/A 6 34 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A 0 % 1 % N/A 1 % 5 % 2003 Cumulative firm orders 147 2,220 1,370 1,049 941 622 Anticipated orders N/A N/A 17 N/A 32 28 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A 1 % N/A 3 % 5 % * Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered units under firm order (see tables in Commercial Airplanes Revenues/Operating Results discussion). Cumulative firm orders include orders that fall within the current accounting quantities as well as orders that extend beyond the current accounting quantities. Cumulative firm orders exclude program test aircraft that will not be refurbished for sale. 717 Program The accounting quantity for the 717 program has been based on firm orders since the fourth quarter of 2001. As of December 31, 2005, of the 5 remaining undelivered units, 3 units will be delivered to a single customer with uncertain financial condition. As a result, on a consolidated basis, these aircraft will be accounted for under long term operating leases as they are delivered. The value of the inventory for the undelivered aircraft as of December 31, 2005, remained realizable. On January 12, 2005, we announced our decision to complete production of the 717 airplane in 2006 due to the lack of overall market demand for the airplane. The decision is expected to result in total pre tax charges of approximately $380 million, of which $280 million was incorporated in 2004 fourth quarter and year end results. The last 717 aircraft is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2006. See Note 24. 31 Table of Contents 737 Next Generation The accounting quantity for the 737 Next Generation program increased by 400 units during 2005 as a result of the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program The 747 program accounting quantity was increased by 24 units during 2005 as a result of additional customer orders. In November 2005, we launched the 747 Advanced as the 747 8 family, which includes 747 8 International passenger airplane and the 747 8 Freighter. This launch and additional anticipated firm orders have extended the life of this program and have also solidified product strategy. 757 Program Due to lack of demand for the 757 program, a decision was made in the third quarter of 2003 to complete production of the program. Production of the 757 program ended in October 2004. The last aircraft was delivered in the second quarter of 2005. The vendor termination liability remaining in Accounts payable and other liabilities was reduced from $121 million to $62 million during 2005 due to $73 million in payments offset by an increase in estimate of $14 million. No future charges related to the 757 airplane program are expected. 767 Program During 2005 the 767 achieved some success in obtaining additional orders. As a result the accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by twelve units during 2005. Given the timing and changing requirements for new USAF tankers, the prospects for the current 767 production program to extend uninterrupted into a USAF tanker contract has diminished. We are continuing to pursue market opportunities for additional 767 sales. Despite the recent airplane orders and the possibility of additional orders, it is still reasonably possible a decision to complete production could be made in 2006. A forward loss is not expected as a result of such a decision but program margins would be reduced. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2005 as a result of the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. In May 2005 we launched the 777 Freighter. Deferred production costs Commercial aircraft inventory production costs incurred on in process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units, determined as described in Note 1 represent deferred production costs. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004 deferred production costs relate to the 777 program and there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders. The deferred production costs and unamortized tooling included in the 777 programs inventory at December 31 are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Deferred production costs $ 683 $ 703 Unamortized tooling 411 485 As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to all other commercial aircraft programs was insignificant relative to the programs balance to go cost estimates. Fleet support We provide the operators of all our commercial airplane models assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the 32 Table of Contents customer receives training, manuals and technical consulting support, and continues throughout the operational life of the aircraft. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and development We continually evaluate opportunities to improve current aircraft models, and assess the marketplace to ensure that our family of commercial jet aircraft is well positioned to meet future requirements of the airline industry. The fundamental strategy is to maintain a broad product line that is responsive to changing market conditions by maximizing commonality among our family of commercial aircraft. Additionally, we are determined to continue to lead the industry in customer satisfaction by offering products with the highest standards of quality, safety, technical excellence, economic performance and in service support. Our Research and Development spending increased $361 million during 2005 and $265 million in 2004. The increase in research and development during 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to increased spending on the 787 program and was partially offset by supplier development cost sharing payments. For 2005, 787 supplier development cost sharing payments received were $611 million compared to $205 million during 2004. We expect to receive a lesser amount of 787 supplier development cost sharing payments in 2006, which will result in an increase to our total research and development expense. We are currently focusing our new airplane product development efforts on the 787 program, which in three planned versions will seat 223 to 296 passengers in multiple class configurations. In early 2004, we received the initial launch order for the 787 and Board of Directors (BoD) approval to proceed with full development and production. Entry into service is targeted for 2008. We are also continuing to develop derivatives and features for our other programs primarily the 737, 747 8 and 777 programs. The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS is organized into four financial reporting segments: A&WS, Network Systems, Support Systems, and L&OS. The first three segments primarily address the U. S. defense market and other limited 33 Table of Contents defense spending worldwide. The fourth segment is focused on the civil and commercial space markets along with the defense market for launch capabilities. On January 27, 2006 we announced in response to a changing market and emerging defense requirements that the IDS segments will be consolidated into three capabilities driven businesses: Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems, Networks and Space Systems, and Support Systems. In addition, a new Advanced Systems unit has been created. Operations will be consolidated into three business profit and loss centers organized around capabilities. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. is faced with continuous force deployments overseas, stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the requirement both to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the recently released 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Report. All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant Federal budget deficits and an administration pledge to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade. The global war on terrorism and the national security threats posed by weapons of mass destruction demand new and improved capabilities such as persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), global precision strike, and assured access to space. Recent operations in support of the global war on terrorism have demonstrated the value of networked and fused ISR combined with advanced command, control and communications systems; interdependence across platforms, services, and Special Forces; and the leveraging effects of precise, persistent, and selective engagement. All of these enable and leverage new capabilities while allowing use of traditional capabilities more discretely and in new ways. The significance and advantage of unmanned systems to perform many of these tasks will continue to be investigated. There is also recognition that technology must be coupled with human intelligence and ground forces to generate the greatest effect. These opportunities and challenges are driving the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD), along with militaries worldwide, both friend and potential foe, to transform their forces and weapons systems as well as the way they use them. Because DoD spending makes up about half of worldwide defense spending and represented greater than 90% of IDS revenue in 2005, the trends and drivers associated with the DoD budget are critical. The DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, particularly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and weve seen that trend continue in the 2007 Presidential budget submittal, although at a moderated rate compared to the last few years. The Presidents request for fiscal year 2007 is $439.3 billion, excluding supplemental appropriations required by ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. This is a 7% increase over the enacted fiscal year 2006 funding level of $410.8 billion. Although the top line had continued to experience growth in the last couple of years, we had seen pressure on the investment accounts (Procurement and Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E)). The portion of the defense budget allocated to DoD procurement decreased between fiscal year 2004 and 2005 and again in 2006. Conversely, in the 2007 Presidential Budget request, the procurement account increased by about 10% and the RDT&E account increased by slightly more than 3% when compared to the enacted 2006 funding levels. (All projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account.) We anticipate that the overall DoD budget will remain in the range of the 2007 request or slightly lower over the next four to five years. Even though we continue to see some growth in the DoD budget, it is unlikely that the DoD will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the 2006 QDR. This imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding. 34 Table of Contents We expect the DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness, network centric operations, persistent ISR, long range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons, and continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Evolving national challenges will be met by reallocating funds within the Department. This will provide opportunities for IDS products in the future. We are already seeing the need for the military to make difficult choices between programs in an effort to fill their highest priority capability gaps. The DoD is also expected to continue to examine the force structure, including personnel and equipment requirements, in search of opportunities to improve business processes and reduce overall manpower. Programs will continually be evaluated by performance and relevancy relative to required DoD capabilities and enduring needs. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment Congress approved close to full funding of NASAs fiscal year 2005 and 2006 budget requests, including needed funds for Space Shuttle Operations, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. NASAs fiscal year 2006 appropriation of $16.6 billion is approximately equal to the fiscal year 2005 funding level. Funding at this level or a slightly higher is projected into the future as evidenced by the 2007 Presidential Budget request of $16.8 billion. NASA is continuing to pursue elements of the Vision for Space Exploration, which will provide additional opportunities. Commercial Space Environment The commercial space market has softened significantly since the late 1990s in conjunction with the downturn in the telecommunications industry. This market is now characterized by overcapacity, aggressive pricing and limited near term opportunities. Recent projections indicate these market conditions will persist until the end of this decade. We believe there will be fewer commercial satellite orders for the next few years with a slight upturn to meet replacement demand near the end of the decade, but we do not project recovery equal to the demand of the early to mid 1990s. In this extremely limited market, we see continued manufacturing overcapacity, which in turn is driving continued deterioration of pricing conditions. We will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions (e.g., DirecTV and Mobile Satellite Ventures). In the launch market, we continue to focus our Delta IV program on the government launch market only, but we offer the capabilities of the Sea Launch system, described below, in the commercial launch area. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers and is reported in the L&OS segment. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the venture conducted four successful launches. We have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist the venture in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we have the right to recover a portion of the cost from other venture partners. We believe our net exposure to loss from Sea Launch at December 31, 2005 totals $125 million. The components of this exposure are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) MaximumExposure EstablishedReserves EstimatedProceedsfromRecourse NetExposure Credit Guarantees $ 490 $ 196 $ 294 Partner Loans (Principal and Interest) 425 255 170 Advances to Provide for Future Launches 123 11 $ 112 Trade Receivable from Sea Launch 246 246 Performance Guarantees 35 1 21 13 Other Receivables from Sea Launch 36 36 $ 1,355 $ 734 $ 496 $ 125 35 Table of Contents We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2005. Delta The USAF lifted the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) suspension on March 4, 2005. (See Note 24.) After this action, we were awarded a contract to provide infrastructure sustainment related to Delta IV launches. In addition, on June 20, 2005 we submitted a proposal in response to the initial Request for Proposals for the EELV Buy III program. Buy III contracts are expected to be issued to us and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) and may ultimately include up to 24 launches and additional infrastructure sustainment funding. The cost estimates for the Delta II and Delta IV programs are based in part upon estimated quantities and timing of launch missions for existing and anticipated contracts, referred to as the Mission Manifest, to determine the allocation of fixed costs to individual launches. Revenue estimates include probable price adjustments due to contractual statement of work changes where we have established contractual entitlement. If these price adjustments do not occur, it could impact the financial performance of the Delta programs. The Mission Manifest represents managements best estimate of the launch services market taking into account all known information. Due to the volatility of the government launch market, it is possible that changes in quantity and timing of launches could occur that would change the Mission Manifest and, therefore, the financial performance of the Delta programs. We have Delta IV inventory of $1.0 billion and fixed assets of $1.0 billion that may be subject to impairment if we are unable to obtain future contracts and appropriate pricing. Based on the mission manifest (estimated quantities and timing of launch missions for existing and anticipated contracts) we believe we will recover these costs. The Delta II and IV programs are reported in the L&OS segment. Satellites As is the standard for the commercial satellite industry, contracts are fixed price in nature and include on orbit incentive payments. Many of the existing satellite programs have very complex designs including unique phased array antenna designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we have continued to experience schedule delays and cost impacts. If the issues continue, they could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the satellites creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed, which could trigger termination for default (TFD) provisions or other financially significant exposure. We have one commercial satellite program that could expose us to a TFD notification risk of $137 million. Management believes a TFD is not likely due to continued performance to contract requirements and continuing contractual efforts in process. Our satellite programs are reported in either the Network Systems or L&OS segments. See discussion of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI)/ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd. (ICO) litigation in note 24. On September 10, 2004, a group of insurance underwriters for Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications (Thuraya) requested arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), against BSSI. The Request for Arbitration alleges that BSSI breached its contract with Thuraya for sale of a 702 36 Table of Contents Satellite which experienced anomalies with its concentrator solar arrays. The claimants seek approximately $199 million (plus claims of interest, costs and fees) consisting of insurance payments made to Thuraya and further reserved the right to seek an additional $39 million currently in dispute between Thuraya and certain of its insurers. Thuraya has reserved its rights to seek uninsured losses that could increase the total amount disputed to $365 million. We believe that these claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. In certain launch and satellite sales contracts, we include provisions for replacement launch services or hardware if we do not meet specified performance criteria. We have historically purchased insurance to cover these exposures when allowed under the terms of the contract. The current insurance market reflects unusually high premium rates and also suffers from a lack of capacity to handle all insurance requirements. We make decisions on the procurement of insurance based on our analysis of risk. There is one contractual launch currently scheduled for the second quarter of 2006 for which full insurance coverage has not been procured. We estimate that the potential uninsured amount for that launch could range from $65 million to $315 million, depending on the nature of the uninsured event. Future Combat Systems On April 5, 2005 the U.S. Army announced that it plans to convert the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program from an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to a standard DoD contract. An OTA is contracted under a different congressional authority than a standard DoD contract and generally imposes fewer administrative contractual requirements. The current OTA has been modified to incorporate clauses relating to the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and the Procurement Integrity Act. We signed a Federal Acquisition Regulations based Undefinitized Contract Authorization with the Army on September 23 and definitization is scheduled for March 2006. Based on our assessment of the possible contractual changes, we do not believe there will be a significant impact to earnings, cash flow and or financial position. Future Imagery Architecture On September 28, 2005 we received a partial stop work order from the National Reconnaissance Office for the Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) program, which makes it probable that our scope of work will be reduced. In the third quarter, revised cost and fee estimates were included in our financial statements to reflect our assessment of the probable outcome. If the final cost and fee outcome is materially different than our current assessment, it could impact our financial performance. The revenue loss was immaterial in 2005. This program is included in the Network Systems segment. 767 Tanker Program Prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, we incurred substantial pre contract costs for development of one in production aircraft for the 767 Tanker program. These costs were being deferred based on our assessment that it was probable we would recover these costs when we were awarded the USAF 767 Tanker contract. The pre contract costs were being deferred and recorded in inventory based on AICPA Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, which states that costs may be deferred if they can be associated with a specific anticipated contract, and if their recoverability from that contract is probable. Our assessment of probability was based on the fact that the DoD Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 provided $100 million funding for tanker replacement and the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005 provided authorization for the procurement of 100 tanker aircraft and associated support contracts. In addition, we believed, based on our understanding of the requirements, that our 767 aircraft was the most cost effective solution that met those requirements and, therefore, that it was probable we would be awarded the USAF 767 Tanker contract. Based on prior DoD contracting practices, we also believed it was probable that we would be awarded the initial support contracts. On January 14, 2005, as a result of our 2004 year end review, we updated our assessment of the probability of securing the USAF 767 Tanker contract and announced our plan to recognize pre tax 37 Table of Contents charges totaling $275 million in our year end 2004 financial statements based on the continued delay of the contract award and the likely re competition of the contract. Commercial Airplanes share was $195 million and IDS share was $80 million. Within IDS, A&WS and Support Systems were impacted by the charge. The charge included $47 million of incurred design and development cost and $33 million for anticipated supplier penalties. Through 2005, the 767 Tanker program has orders for eight 767 Tankers, four from the Italian Air Force and four from the Japan Self Defense Agency. The first aircraft for Italy will be tendered for acceptance in late 2006 and our first delivery to Japan will occur in early 2007. Work continues on the Company Sponsored Research and Development (CSR&D) effort as we entered the flight test phase of the program in 2005 and expect to complete it in 2006. The USAF is continuing to pursue a replacement for the KC 135 tanker. Funding has been included in the DoD Appropriation Act for both of its fiscal years 2005 and 2006, and has also been included in the fiscal year 2007 DoD budget request. The USAF has announced that the replacement for the KC 135 will be awarded through a competition which will be held in 2006. We remain firmly committed to the USAF Tanker program and are ready to support our customer in whatever decision is made regarding the recapitalization of the nations current aerial refueling fleet. Comanche On February 23, 2004 the U.S. Government announced plans to terminate for convenience (TFC) the RAH 66 Comanche Engineering and Manufacturing Development contract. The joint venture between us and Sikorsky Aircraft, a division of United Technologies Corporation, had a 50/50 share in program work and earnings. On March 19, 2004 the U.S. Government issued a partial TFC notification. A termination proposal was submitted to the U.S. Government on February 25, 2005. An updated proposal was submitted in January 2006 to reflect actual costs through 2005. We expect that a settlement will be reached by the end of the first quarter of 2006. The program represented less than 1% of our 2005 revenues. No material impact on our financial statements is expected. Integrated Defense Systems (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 30,791 $ 30,465 $ 27,361 % of Total Company Revenues 56 % 58 % 54 % Operating Earnings $ 3,890 $ 2,925 $ 766 Operating Margins 12.6 % 9.6 % 2.8 % Research and Development $ 855 $ 834 $ 846 Contractual Backlog $ 36,341 $ 39,151 $ 40,883 Unobligated Backlog $ 43,759 $ 47,270 $ 50,564 Since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts, or as one large multi year order or long term awards. As a result, period to period comparisons of orders and backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context IDS revenues remained stable in 2005 due to moderating defense budgets, up 1% from 2004, after strong growth of 11% in 2004 over 2003. The operating earnings increase of $965 million from 2004 to 38 Table of Contents 2005 was primarily due to higher L&OS earnings largely driven by the net gain of $578 million ($9 million of which was recognized at the Other segment) from the Rocketdyne divestiture in 2005. Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents funded work to perform, and unobligated backlog, which represents unfunded work to perform. IDS total backlog decreased 7% in 2005, from $86.4 billion to $80.1 billion, yet still remains industry leading. Given our annual revenue of almost $31 billion, we have 2.6 years worth of sales in backlog, an important indicator of future workload. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Aircraft and Weapons Systems (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 11,444 $ 11,394 $ 10,763 % of Total Company Revenues 21 % 22 % 21 % Operating Earnings $ 1,707 $ 1,636 $ 1,420 Operating Margins 14.9 % 14.4 % 13.2 % Research and Development $ 374 $ 382 $ 360 Contractual Backlog $ 19,161 $ 18,256 $ 19,352 Unobligated Backlog $ 12,006 $ 17,197 $ 24,176 Revenues A&WS revenues remained stable between 2004 and 2005 primarily due to increased deliveries on F 15 and Apache and higher volume on C 40 and F 22. This was offset by decreased deliveries on F/A 18 and lower volume on Chinook, V 22, and the Comanche termination. Revenues grew 6% from 2003 to 2004 due to increased deliveries on F/A 18 and Apache and higher volume on F 22 and Chinook. This was partially offset by fewer deliveries on T 45 and lower volume as a result of the Comanche termination in 2004. Deliveries of units for new build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications were as follows: Aircraft and Weapon Systems 2005 2004 2003 C 17 Globemaster 16 16 16 F/A 18E/F Super Hornet 42 48 44 T 45TS Goshawk 10 7 12 F 15E Eagle 6 3 4 C 40A Clipper 2 3 1 AH 64 Apache 12 3 Operating Earnings A&WS operating earnings increased 4% between 2004 and 2005 even though revenues were stable. In addition to continued strong performance, the 767 Tanker program CSR&D effort in 2005 was reduced as compared to 2004 and operating earnings in 2004 were negatively impacted by the charges discussed above related to the USAF Tanker program. 39 Table of Contents Operating earnings grew 15% from 2003 to 2004 partly due to the revenue growth mentioned above and partly due to significant performance improvements from contract close out activity and lean initiatives in 2004, partially offset by the 2004 767 Tanker charges. Research and Development The A&WS segment continues to focus its research and development where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large scale integration capabilities to provide transformational solutions to meet the war fighters enduring needs. Spending has remained consistent over the past three years. Research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures, system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies across a broad spectrum of capabilities designed to enhance situational awareness and survivability, increase mission effectiveness and interoperability, and improve affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Continued research and development investments in unmanned systems have enabled the demonstration of multi vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high performance unmanned combat air vehicles. Research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes, among other things, precision guidance and multi mode targeting. Research and development investments in the Global Tanker Transport Aircraft program represent a significant opportunity to provide state of the art refueling capabilities to domestic and international customers. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the F/A 18E/F Super Hornet, F 15E Eagle, AH 64 Apache, CH 47 Chinook and C 17 Globemaster III. Backlog A&WS total backlog decreased 12% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to sales on C 17 and F/A 18 from multi year contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by additional F 15 and Chinook orders. Total backlog decreased 19% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to sales on C 17 and F/A 18 from multi year contracts awarded in prior years. Network Systems (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 11,264 $ 11,221 $ 9,198 % of Total Company Revenues 21 % 21 % 18 % Operating Earnings $ 638 $ 969 $ 645 Operating Margins 5.7 % 8.6 % 7.0 % Research and Development $ 285 $ 234 $ 195 Contractual Backlog $ 6,228 $ 10,190 $ 11,715 Unobligated Backlog $ 28,316 $ 26,097 $ 22,907 Revenues Network Systems revenues remained stable between 2004 and 2005 as significant growth in FCS and Airborne Command and Control programs such as MMA and 737 Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) was offset by lower volume in Proprietary, Ground based Midcourse Defense (GMD), and the completion of the Homeland Security contract. Revenues grew 22% from 2003 to 2004 due to strong growth in FCS, GMD, Proprietary, and Airborne Command and Control programs, partially offset by lower volume in Homeland Security. Operating Earnings Network Systems operating earnings decreased 34% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to revised cost and fee estimates in 2005 resulting from technical and quality issues on Proprietary, GMD, 737 AEW&C, and a military satellite program. 40 Table of Contents Earnings increased 50% from 2003 to 2004 partly due to the revenue growth mentioned above; improved performance in Homeland Security and Proprietary partially offset by revised cost and fee estimates on a military satellite program and GMD in 2004; and due to a $55 million pre tax charge taken in 2003 on the Resource 21 joint venture when NASA did not award us an imagery contract. Research and Development The Network Systems research and development funding remains focused on the development of Communications and Command & Control capabilities that support a network centric architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include Joint Tactical Radio System, Global Positioning System, and Transformational Communications System. Investments were also made to support various Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance business opportunities including MMA, AEW&C aircraft, and concepts that will lead to the development of next generation space intelligence systems. A major contributor to our support of these DoD transformation programs is the investment in the Boeing Integration Center (BIC) and extended network of modeling, simulation and analysis capabilities where our Network Centric Operations concepts are developed in partnership with our customers. Significant upgrades were made in 2005 to the Virtual Warfare Center in St Louis and several other smaller facilities. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network centric capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in Global Missile Defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. Backlog Network Systems total backlog decreased 5% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to sales in 2005 from large multi year orders received in prior years on FCS, GMD, and MMA, partially offset by orders for Proprietary programs. Total backlog increased 5% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to additional orders for FCS and the initial MMA award in 2004. Support Systems (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 5,342 $ 4,881 $ 4,408 % of Total Company Revenues 10 % 9 % 9 % Operating Earnings $ 765 $ 662 $ 455 Operating Margins 14.3 % 13.6 % 10.3 % Research and Development $ 80 $ 57 $ 59 Contractual Backlog $ 8,366 $ 6,505 $ 5,882 Unobligated Backlog $ 1,185 $ 1,573 $ 1,297 Revenues Support Systems revenues grew 9% from 2004 to 2005 due to increased volume in Integrated Support programs such as C 17, F 15 Korea, AC 130, and CV 22, partially offset by lower volume in Maintenance, Modification & Upgrade (MM&U) programs like KC 135. Revenues grew 11% from 2003 to 2004 due to increased volume in Supply Chain Services programs such as Apache spares, Integrated Support programs like C 17, and Training & Support Systems programs such as Fixed Wing and Rotorcraft. Operating Earnings Support Systems operating earnings grew 16% from 2004 to 2005 partly reflecting the revenue increase mentioned above, partly due to continued performance improvements 41 Table of Contents in 2005 in Training & Support Systems, MM&U, and Supply Chain Services programs and partly due to a 767 Tanker $18 million pre tax write off of pre contract costs in 2004 due to a slip in the award of the USAF contract. Earnings grew 45% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the significant performance improvements from contract close out activities and lean initiatives in 2004 as well as the increased revenue mentioned above, partially offset by the 2004 pre tax charge on the 767 Tanker program mentioned above. Research and Development Support Systems continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including Engineering and Logistic Services, MM&U, Supply Chain Services, Training and Support Systems, and Advanced Logistics Services, as well as on moving into the innovative Network Centric Logistics (NCL) areas. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative and disciplined tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C 17 Globemaster Sustainment partnership, the F/A 18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming (FIRST) program, and the F 15 Singapore Performance Based Logistics contract. Backlog Support Systems total backlog increased 18% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to orders in Supply Chain Services and Engineering and Logistics Services, partially offset by sales throughout the segment. Total backlog increased 13% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to orders in Life Cycle Customer Support programs, partially offset by sales throughout the segment. Launch & Orbital Systems (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 2,741 $ 2,969 $ 2,992 % of Total Company Revenues 5 % 6 % 6 % Operating Earnings $ 780 $ (342 ) $ (1,754 ) Operating Margins 28.5 % (11.5 )% (58.6 )% Research and Development $ 116 $ 161 $ 232 Contractual Backlog $ 2,586 $ 4,200 $ 3,934 Unobligated Backlog $ 2,252 $ 2,403 $ 2,184 Revenues L&OS revenues decreased 8% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to launch slips caused by the strike by the IAM and the Rocketdyne divestiture in 2005 and a favorable TFC settlement on a commercial satellite program in 2004. This was partially offset by higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005. Revenues remained stable from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the favorable TFC settlement in 2004 mentioned above offset by lower satellite and launch deliveries and milestone completions in 2004 compared to 2003. Deliveries of production units were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Delta II 2 4 4 Delta IV 2 Commercial/Civil Satellites 3 2 3 42 Table of Contents Operating Earnings The L&OS operating earnings improvement from 2004 to 2005 was driven by the net gains on the sale of Rocketdyne $578 million, ($9 million of which was recognized at the Other segment) and EDD ($25 million), gain from the sale of a parcel of land at our Seal Beach, California facility, and higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005. The operating losses recorded in 2004 were caused by performance issues in the satellite business due to cost growth from technical and quality issues and write offs of slow moving satellite inventory and also by cost growth on our Delta IV program, partially offset by the favorable TFC settlement mentioned above. The earnings improvement from 2003 to 2004 was primarily driven by two significant events in 2003. First, a goodwill impairment charge of $572 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 as a result of an internal reorganization whereby the SFAS No. 142 reportable segments, operating segments, and reporting unit designations changed, causing significantly different relationships between reporting unit carrying values and fair values. Specifically, the new L&OS reporting unit was created by combining six pre existing reporting units. The carrying value of one of these reporting units, Boeing Satellite Systems, exceeded its fair value resulting in the goodwill balances at this reporting unit being fully impaired during 2002. However, the carrying values of the other five reporting units were less than their fair values, so the goodwill balances at these reporting units were not impaired during 2002. In addition, the Board of Directors in early 2003 approved our long range business plan which included downward revisions to cash flow projections for the L&OS reporting unit. The combination of these factors resulted in the newly created L&OS reporting unit having a carrying value that exceeded its fair value, prompting recognition of the goodwill impairment charge. In addition, 2003 earnings were further impacted by a second quarter charge of $1,030 million, of which $835 million was attributable to the Delta IV program caused by a combination of factors. The most significant driver was the requirement to spread fixed costs of the Delta IV program over a reduced number of anticipated launches as a result of continued weakness in the commercial space launch market, resulting in an earnings impact of $412 million. Secondly, the program experienced cost growth of $360 million primarily related to payload integration and launch support costs. In each of these cases, the additional costs were not billable under the respective contracts. In addition, the remaining $63 million of the charge resulted from our determination that it was no longer probable that our U.S. Government customer would agree to price increases for change orders in connection with existing contracted and awarded Delta IV launches. The remaining $195 million of the 2003 charge related to Boeing Satellite Systems incurring additional costs as a result of satellite program complexities. These complexities caused technical and quality issues resulting in schedule delays, cost impacts, and late delivery penalties which were not billable under the respective contract. The 2003 results also include the adjustments made to equity investments in Ellipso, SkyBridge and Teledesic resulting in a net write down of $27 million. Divestitures On February 28, 2005, we completed the stock sale of EDD to L 3 Communications. On August 2, 2005, we completed the sale of the Rocketdyne business to United Technologies Corporation (UTC). See Note 8. Investments We are a 50/50 partner with Lockheed in a joint venture called United Space Alliance, which is responsible for all ground processing of the Space Shuttle fleet and for space related operations with the USAF. United Space Alliance also performs modifications, testing and checkout operations that are required to ready the Space Shuttle for launch. United Space Alliance operations are performed under cost plus type contracts. Our proportionate share of joint venture earnings is recognized as income from operating investments in the consolidated statements of operations. The operating earnings resulting from this venture for 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $72 million, $70 million, and $52 million, respectively. We have also entered into an agreement with Lockheed to create a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance (ULA). ULA will combine the production, engineering, test and launch operations 43 Table of Contents associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Martin Atlas rockets. It is expected that ULA will reduce the cost of meeting the critical national security and NASA expendable launch vehicle needs of the United States. The closing of the ULA transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including government and regulatory approval in the United States and internationally. On August 9, 2005, Boeing and Lockheed received clearance regarding the formation of ULA from the European Commission. On October 24, 2005, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requested additional information from us and Lockheed related to ULA in response to the pre merger notice under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR) submitted by the parties. The FTCs second request extends the period that the FTC is permitted to review the transaction under the HSR Act. Upon completion of the transaction, ULA would be reported as an equity method investment. We do not expect this agreement to have a material impact to our earnings, cash flows and or financial position for 2006. If the conditions to closing are not satisfied and the ULA transaction is not consummated by March 31, 2006, either we or Lockheed Martin may terminate the joint venture agreement. Research and Development The L&OS research and development investment is currently focused on the development of key technologies and systems solutions to support our NASA customer in the development of new space exploration systems. We also continue to make prudent investments of research and development resources in the satellite manufacturing business to enhance existing designs to meet evolving customer requirements. Finally, continued research and development investment was used to complete anomaly resolution on the Delta IV vehicle. Backlog L&OS total backlog decreased 27% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to reduced orders for satellites and Space Shuttle Return to Flight activity. Total backlog increased 8% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to large orders for DIRECTV commercial satellites and additional NASA activity, partially offset by sales throughout the segment. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends In the commercial aircraft market, BCC provides selective financing solutions to our Commercial Airplanes segment customers. In the space and defense markets, BCC primarily structures financing solutions for our IDS segment customers. BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 totaled $9.2 billion, which was substantially all our commercial aircraft. While worldwide traffic levels are well above traffic levels carried by the airlines in the recent past, the effects of higher fuel prices on the airline industry continue to impact commercial aircraft values. Recently published sources and market transactions indicate that passenger load factors are at record high levels, the supply of economically viable used aircraft is limited and, lease rates for aircraft are increasing. However, despite these positive environmental factors, values for the various aircraft types serving as collateral in BCCs portfolio generally have not increased. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. At the same time, the credit ratings of many airlines, particularly in the United States, have remained at low levels. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,900 commercial jet aircraft (10.2% of current world fleet) continue to be parked, including both in production and out of production aircraft types of which over 50% are not expected to return to service. At December 31, 2005, $2.6 billion of BCCs portfolio was collateralized by 717 aircraft. During 2005, BCC and the Other segment provided $25 million and $76 million in valuation reserves due to a decrease in the collateral value of the 717 aircraft. Should the 717 aircraft suffer an additional decline in value, such impacts could result in a potential material adverse effect on the Other Segments earnings, cash flows and or financial position. 44 Table of Contents In October 2003, Commercial Airplanes announced the decision to end production of the 757 aircraft, and the final 757 aircraft was produced in October 2004. At December 31, 2005, $1.2 billion of BCCs portfolio was collateralized by the 757 aircraft. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Other segment provided $22 million in our valuation reserve due to a decrease in the collateral value of the 757 aircraft. Should the 757 aircraft suffer a decline in value and market acceptance, such impacts could result in a potential material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and or financial position. Significant Customer Contingencies A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airline customers. Certain customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or requested lease or loan restructurings; these negotiations were in various stages as of December 31, 2005. BCC does not expect that the current bankruptcies or reorganizations of ATA Holdings Corp (ATA), Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense (VARIG), Delta or Northwest including a return of some or all of the aircraft financed will have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and or financial position. United Airlines, Inc. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, United Airlines, Inc. (United) accounted for $1.1 billion (11.7%) of BCCs total portfolio. At December 31, 2005, United was BCCs second largest customer based on portfolio carrying value. At December 31, 2005, the United portfolio was secured by security interests in two 767 aircraft and 13 777 aircraft and by an ownership and security interest in five 757 aircraft. At December 31, 2005, United was current on all of its obligations related to these 20 aircraft. On February 1, 2006, United emerged from bankruptcy and has assumed all our financing which were restructured in September 2003 as part of the bankruptcy proceeding. ATA Holdings Corp. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, ATA accounted for $253 million and $705 million (2.7% and 7.3%) of BCCs total portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the ATA portfolio consisted of six operating leases for 757 aircraft and a note receivable. On October 26, 2004, ATA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, on December 29, 2004, BCC entered into an agreement in principle with ATA whereby ATA agreed to continue to lease 12 757 aircraft under restructured terms and agreed to return eight of the 12 757 aircraft during the second half of 2005 and early 2006. ATA is obligated to pay rent on all aircraft until returned. BCC concurrently entered into an agreement with Continental Airlines (Continental) to lease each of these eight 757 aircraft as they are returned by ATA. In February 2005, following completion of certain conditions, BCC reclassified the 12 757 aircraft from finance leases to operating leases. On July 14, 2005, the bankruptcy court approved the assumption of 11 of the restructured 757 aircraft leases by mutual agreement between BCC and ATA, one 757 aircraft lease was rejected and the aircraft returned to accommodate BCCs timely re leasing of the aircraft to Continental. The bankruptcy court order also approved a settlement agreement setting forth BCCs deficiency claim for the four 757 aircraft to be retained by ATA and a process for determining the amount of our deficiency claims for the remaining eight 757 aircraft that will be returned to BCC. During 2005, six of the eight aircraft were returned and subsequently delivered to Continental. The remaining two aircraft were returned to BCC and delivered to Continental in January 2006. Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, VARIG accounted for $270 million and $400 million (2.9% and 4.1%) of BCCs total portfolio. At December 31, 2005 the VARIG portfolio consisted of two 737 aircraft and six MD 11 aircraft. We exercised early lease termination rights and took possession of two MD 11 aircraft in the second quarter of 2005 with a carrying value of $73 million. The aircraft were subsequently sold to another customer. On June 17, 2005, VARIG filed a request for reorganization which was granted on June 22, 2005 by Brazilian Reorganization Courts. In 45 Table of Contents October 2005, VARIG returned one MD 11 aircraft which was immediately re leased to another customer. In December 2005, VARIGs reorganization plan was approved both by the creditors and the Brazilian Reorganization Court. In recent years, VARIG has repeatedly defaulted on its obligations under leases with BCC, which has resulted in deferrals and restructurings, some of which are ongoing. Delta Air Lines, Inc. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Delta accounted for $118 million and $146 million (1.3% and 1.5%) of BCCs total portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the Delta portfolio consisted of two EETCs secured by 17 767 aircraft, 18 737 aircraft and 13 757 aircraft. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Delta retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject the restructuring terms with its creditors and return aircraft, including BCC aircraft. To date, none of the aircraft securing BCCs investments have been rejected or returned. Although Delta has affirmed its obligations for the two EETCs in the bankruptcy court, Delta still reserves the right to reject or return the aircraft. Northwest Airlines, Inc. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Northwest accounted for $494 million and $295 million (5.4% and 3.0%) of BCCs total portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the Northwest portfolio consisted of notes receivable on three 747 aircraft, three 757 aircraft, and three additional notes receivable, as well as an EETC secured by 11 A319 aircraft, three A330 aircraft and six 757 aircraft and an ETC secured by one 747 aircraft. On September 14, 2005, Northwest filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Northwest retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject the restructuring terms with its creditors and return aircraft, including BCC aircraft. Northwest has filed a motion to reject leases or return certain aircraft. Although Northwest has identified one 747 aircraft financed by an ETC in which BCC owns an interest as being subject to potential rejection, this aircraft has not yet been rejected or returned. In October 2005, Northwest requested a restructuring of certain obligations and BCC is currently negotiating restructuring terms. As a result of the current financial difficulties of Northwest, BCC has deemed the EETC and ETC to be other than temporarily impaired. During the third quarter of 2005, we reduced the carrying values of these investments to their estimated fair values of $26 million and recorded an asset impairment charge of $24 million. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 966 $ 959 $ 991 % of Total Company Revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % Operating Earnings $ 232 $ 183 $ 91 Operating Margins 24 % 19 % 9 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of interest from financing receivables and notes, lease income from equipment under operating lease, investment income, and gains on disposals of investments. BCCs revenues were essentially unchanged in 2005. The decrease in revenue in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily attributable to lower new business volume. Operating Earnings BCCs operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. The increase in 2005 operating earnings was primarily due to a lower asset impairment expense and the absence of debt redemption costs partially offset by increased depreciation expense. 46 Table of Contents As summarized in the following table, during the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized pre tax expenses of $132 million, of which $34 million related to BCC, in response to the deterioration in the credit worthiness of BCCs airline customers, airline bankruptcy filings and the continued decline in the commercial aircraft and general equipment asset values. For the same period in 2004, we recognized pre tax expenses of $165 million in response to the deterioration, of which $68 million related to BCC.

During 2005, BCC recorded a net recovery through the provision for losses of $25 million. This amount consisted of a net benefit of $26 million as a result of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc.s (Hawaiian) emergence from bankruptcy (including a partial offset by a decline in the collateral value of the 717 aircraft leased to Hawaiian), a benefit of $16 million as a result of the repayment of certain notes and a net provision of $17 million. During 2004, BCC also recorded a net recovery through the provision for losses of $38 million. This amount consisted of the mitigation of collateral exposure with certain customers and a net benefit due to refinements in the methodology for measuring collateral values, offset by certain impaired receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2005, BCC recorded customer financing related asset impairment charges of $13 million due to the reduction of estimated future cash flows. In addition, BCC recorded an impairment charge of $20 million related to a Commercial Financial Services (CFS) asset, which was not subject to the purchase and sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC). During the year ended December 31, 2005, BCC reduced the carrying value of certain of its EETCs and an ETC due to an other than temporary impairment of $53 million, partially offset by the fair value of other collateral available to BCC in the amount of $27 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, BCC recognized customer financing related charges totaling $27 million as a result of declines in market values and projected future rents for aircraft and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2004, BCC also recognized a charge of $79 million which consisted of $47 million related to an other than temporary impairment of a held to maturity investment in ATA maturing in 2015, and $32 million related to the impairment of a D tranche EETC which finances aircraft with Delta. BCC carefully monitors the relative value of aircraft equipment since we remain at substantial economic risk to significant decreases in the value of aircraft equipment and their associated lease rates. At December 31, 2005 2004 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 9,206 $ 9,680 % of Total Receivables in Valuation Allowance 2.0 % 4.2 % Debt $ 6,322 $ 7,024 Debt to Equity Ratio 5.0 to 1 5.0 to 1 47 Table of Contents BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 decreased from December 31, 2004 due to normal portfolio run off, the impact of restructuring certain finance leases to operating leases resulting in a $200 million charge off to the allowance, the sale of certain portfolio assets, and prepayments. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, BCC had $47 million and $37 million of assets that were held for sale or re lease, which, as of December 31, 2005, included $36 million of assets currently under lease. Of the remaining $11 million and $37 million of assets held for sale or re lease at December 31, 2005 and 2004, $6 million and $25 million had firm contracts to be placed on lease. Additionally, leases with a carrying value of approximately $363 million are scheduled to terminate in the next 12 months. The related aircraft are being remarketed, of which $238 million were identified with firm contracts in place at December 31, 2005, to be sold or placed on lease. Other Segment Other segment operating losses were $334 million during 2005 as compared to losses of $535 million during 2004. Major factors contributing to results for the other segment are described below. During 2003 and 2004, we delivered a total of five 767 aircraft to a joint venture named TRM Aircraft Leasing Co. Ltd. (TRM). Such arrangement was accounted for as an operating lease due to additional financing and expense sharing arrangements with TRM. As a result, as of December 31, 2004, we deferred lease income of $379 million. During April 2005, we terminated our ongoing obligations to TRM and also received full payment from TRM for the financing arrangement and recognized the remaining deferred lease income of $369 million and repayment for the financing arrangement of $42 million as revenue and charged the remaining net asset value to Cost of services. This transaction resulted in earnings before income taxes of $63 million in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2005. (See Note 15) In 2005, we recorded provisions for customer financing losses of $98 million, which consisted of losses of $76 million and $22 million, due to the decrease in the collateral values of the 717 and 757, respectively. In 2004, such provisions were $82 million due to deteriorated airline credit ratings and depressed aircraft values. Additionally, charges of $13 million were recognized in 2004 related to the decline in lease rates on certain aircraft. In 2005, we sold real property and equipment which resulted in a pretax gain of $29 million reported in the other segment. During 2004, we recorded depreciation of $61 million related to a demolished building and incurred an additional $18 million pretax loss related to accounting for various real property transactions. In 2005, our research and development costs recorded at Boeing Technology decreased by approximately $32 million primarily due to cost reduction strategies implemented across the business units during the year. Critical Accounting Policies and Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding 48 Table of Contents contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. Government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contracts sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. During all of 2005, IDSs gross margin performance fell within the historical range of plus or minus 1.0% change to gross margin. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2005 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1.0%, it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately $308 million. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the forecasted market and corresponding production rates. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are recognized on a prospective basis. 49 Table of Contents Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. Our recent experience has been that estimated changes due to accounting quantity, model mix, escalation, and cost performance adjustments have resulted in changes over the course of a year to the combined cost of sales percentages of all commercial airplane programs within a range of plus or minus 1%. If combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2005 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased income for 2005 by approximately $190 million. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade in commitments The fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such as, model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets to which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, (1) the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long term storage, (2) the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements, or (3) the scrap market. Collateral valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly collateral valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Based on the best market information available at the time, it is probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade in commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $72 million and $116 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Accounts payable and other liabilities included $22 million and $25 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, which represents the exposure related to these trade in commitments. Had the estimate of trade in value used to calculate our obligation related to probable trade in commitments been 10% higher or lower than our actual assessment, using a measurement date of December 31, 2005, Accounts payable and other liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately $5 million. We continually update our assessment of the likelihood of our trade in aircraft purchase commitments and continue to monitor all these commitments for adverse developments. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re lease When events or circumstances indicate (and no less than annually), we review the carrying value of all aircraft and equipment under operating lease and held for sale or re lease for potential impairment. We evaluate assets under operating lease or held for re lease for impairment when the expected undiscounted cash flow over the remaining useful life is less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow. A key assumption is the expected future lease rates. We also include assumptions about lease terms, end of economic life value of the aircraft or equipment, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset and estimated proceeds from future asset sales. We state assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. 50 Table of Contents When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of asset impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on these assets been 10% lower, we estimate that the asset impairment expense would have increased by approximately $46 million during 2005. We are unable to predict the magnitude or likelihood of any future impairments. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing, however, the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market. The lower of cost or market assessment is performed quarterly using the process described in the Used aircraft under trade in commitments section. Allowance for losses on receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, results of individual credit reviews and the general state of the economy and airline industry. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase/decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. We review the adequacy of the allowance by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate (i.e. the credit adjusted collateral exposure). We determine the collateral value by calculating the median values obtained from third party equipment appraisers industry data. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Credit ratings are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based on public information and information obtained directly from our customers. In recognition of the uncertainty of the ultimate loss experience and relatively long duration of the portfolio, a range of reasonably possible outcomes of the portfolios credit adjusted collateral exposure is calculated by varying the applicable default rate by approximately plus or minus 15%. The resulting range of the allowance necessary to cover credit adjusted collateral exposure as of December 31, 2005, was approximately $240 million to $307 million. Lease Residual Values Equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the lease term or projected economic life of the asset. At December 31, 2005, the projected residual value of total equipment under operating leases was $2.6 billion. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases. For example, a change in the estimated residual values of 1% could result in a cumulative pre tax earnings impact of $26 million as of December 31, 2005, to be recognized over the remaining term of the lease portfolio. 51 Table of Contents Goodwill impairment Due to various acquisitions, goodwill has historically constituted a significant portion of our long term assets. We perform our goodwill impairment test annually, on April 1, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions, and are subject to review and approval by our senior management and Board of Directors. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of our previous impairment test, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements. Postretirement plans The liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the expected long term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). We use a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of our September 30 annual measurement date. This rate is determined based on a review of long term, high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that match projected benefit payments of our major U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds. (See Note 17) In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2005 (in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Dollars Dollars Projected benefit obligation (pensions) (1,370 ) 1,570 Net periodic pension cost (160 ) 150 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (180 ) 200 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (15 ) 15 Net periodic pension costs include an underlying expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets. This expected return on assets assumption is derived from an extensive study conducted by our Trust Investments group and its actuaries on a periodic basis. The study includes a review of 52 Table of Contents actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes with consideration given to the related investment strategy. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long term prospective return. The expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit (income)/cost for the upcoming plan year. Pension income or expense is sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2005 pension income by approximately $103 million. Net periodic pension cost also includes an amortization of unrecognized gains and losses and changes in liabilities due to plan amendments. The amount of unrecognized gains and losses can be significant and can significantly increase (or decrease) future net periodic pension cost. The funded status of pension plans is sensitive to the discount rate and actual returns on assets. Changes in the funded status may have significant immediate impacts on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of a new measurement date. At present, our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position includes a prepaid pension asset, which primarily represents losses that have not yet been recognized. In the normal course of events, the loss will be recognized over a period of years and the prepaid pension asset will be correspondingly reduced. However, under certain economic conditions, we could be required to recognize all or a substantial portion of the recognized loss in a single accounting period. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87 requires recognition of a minimum liability equal to the excess (if any) of a pension plans accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) over its assets. The ABO is the actuarial present value of the plans obligation for benefits earned to date but without credit for expected future salary increases. When a plan has an unfunded ABO, or required minimum liability, it is also required to recognize any prepaid pension asset (if any) in excess of unrecognized prior service cost. Because the companys prepaid pension asset is significant, it is possible that under certain circumstances such as poor actual return on pension assets or low discount rate, several or all of our pension plans could become underfunded and we would have to recognize an additional liability equal to the amount underfunded plus the prepaid pension asset. Such a recognition could result in a significant reduction of our equity in the form of a reduction in Other comprehensive income. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash that we would contribute to the pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law (ERISA) and discretionary contributions made to improve the plans funded status. Net periodic costs for other postretirement plans include an assumption of the medical cost trend. To determine the medical trend we look at a combination of information including our future expected medical costs, recent medical costs over the past five years, and general expectations in the industry. The assumed medical cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2005 (in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 712 (624 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 62 (53 ) 53 Table of Contents Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In September 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty (EITF 04 13). EITF 04 13 defines when a purchase and a sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same line of business should be considered a single nonmonetary transaction subject to Accounting Principles Board Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. The Task Force agreed this Issue should be applied to new arrangements entered into in reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2006, and to all inventory transactions that are completed after December 15, 2006, for arrangements entered into prior to March 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of EITF 04 13 on our financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF 04 5). EITF 04 5 provides guidance as to when a general partner, or the general partners as a group, control a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. EITF 04 5 is effective as of June 29, 2005 for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified. EITF 04 5 is effective as of January 1, 2006 for all other limited partnerships. Our adoption of the provisions of EITF 04 5 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43. This Standard requires that certain abnormal costs be recognized as current period charges rather than as a portion of the inventory cost, and that fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facility. The provisions of this Standard apply prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred after January 1, 2006. While we believe this Standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements, the impact of adopting these new rules is dependent on events that could occur in future periods, and cannot be determined until the event occurs in future periods. Contingent Items Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance. Major contingencies are discussed below. Government investigations We are subject to various U.S. Government investigations, including those related to procurement activities and the alleged possession and misuse of third party proprietary data, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted. Such proceedings involve, or could involve claims by the Government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of these disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, except as set forth in Note 24 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other contingencies We are also a defendant in suits filed by Lockheed, ICO Global Communications, Ltd. and several of our employees. See Note 24. 54 Table of Contents We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites discussed. Such requirements have resulted in our being involved in legal proceedings, claims and remediation obligations since the 1980s. We routinely assess, based on in depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and of recoveries from insurance carriers. Our policy is to immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on our best estimate within a range of potential exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such activities have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on us. With respect to results of operations, related charges have averaged less than 1% of historical annual revenues. Although not considered likely, should we be required to incur remediation charges at the high level of the range of potential exposure, the additional charges would be less than 3% of historical annual revenues. Because of the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminated sites and circumstances, the potential exists for environmental remediation costs to be materially different from the estimated costs accrued for identified contaminated sites. However, based on all known facts and expert analyses, we believe it is not reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in additional costs that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or to our operating results and cash flow trends. We have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2005 and approximately $3.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally investments, fixed rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes. Additionally, Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC) uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the current holdings of investments, as well as related swaps, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material for these instruments. The investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue, do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt. The principal source of BCCs market risk relates to interest rate changes. This risk is managed by matching the profile of BCCs liabilities with the profile of assets. In a state of perfect matching, assets would be funded by debt of an equivalent term and other attributes. Perfect matching is impractical and inefficient given the irregular and unexpected amortization of some assets compared to how capital markets function as a source of funding. The ensuing exposure to mismatch risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives. We do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 55 Table of Contents Every quarter BCC uses duration based measures and analysis to estimate the impact of changes in interest rates. Potential changes in the net fair value of assets, liabilities and derivatives are calculated based on the amount and timing of projected cash flows. It is important to note that these measures and sensitivity analysis are estimates and tools that depend on the assumptions and parameters used in the related models. These models must be complemented by the experience and judgment of management. Although the assets, liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded, based on an immediate, one time, 100 basis point increase in market rates at December 31, 2005, BCC estimated that the tax adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by $15 million compared to a decrease of $7 million at December 31, 2004. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2005, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by $28.0 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. Commodity price risk We are subject to commodity price risk relating principally to energy used in production. We periodically use commodity derivatives, such as fixed price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes of commodities. Commodity price exposure related to unhedged contracts is not material. 56 Table of Contents
