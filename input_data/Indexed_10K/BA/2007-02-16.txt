Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacturing, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second largest defense contractor in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world. Our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses Commercial Airplanes and Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS is a defense systems business that integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications and space to deliver capability driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses with a simultaneously intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others cyclicality. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and managing overall financial exposures. In 2006, our revenues grew by 15 percent. Earnings from operations increased 7%. We continued to invest in key growth programs as Research and Development expense grew by 48% to $3.3 billion, reflecting increased spending on the 787 and 747 8 programs and lower cost sharing payments from suppliers. We generated operating cash flow of $7.5 billion driven by operating and working capital performance. We reduced debt by $1.2 billion and repurchased 25 million common shares. Our contractual backlog grew 35% to $217 billion, driven by 40% growth at Commercial Airplanes while our total backlog grew 22% to $250 billion. At the end of 2006, we implemented new accounting rules for pensions and other post retirement benefits, which together with the annual remeasurement of our pension plans reduced our shareholders equity by $6.5 billion. This decrease did not affect cash flows or the funded status of our benefit plans. We expect continued growth in Commercial Airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand by ramping up commercial aircraft production. We expect IDS revenue to be slightly lower in 2007 and anticipate that the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) budget growth will moderate over the next several years. We are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer focused growth. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Commercial Airplanes $ 28,465 $ 21,365 $ 19,925 Integrated Defense Systems 32,439 31,106 30,739 Boeing Capital Corporation 1,025 966 959 Other 299 657 275 Accounting differences/eliminations (698 ) (473 ) (498 ) Total revenues $ 61,530 $ 53,621 $ 51,400 18 Table of Contents Higher consolidated revenues in 2006 were primarily due to higher new commercial aircraft deliveries. IDS revenues were up moderately in 2006 as growth in Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems and Support Systems was partially offset by lower volume in Network and Space Systems. BCC revenues increased in 2006 primarily due to higher investment income and higher net gain on disposal of assets. Other segment revenues decreased in 2006 as a result of the buyout of several operating lease aircraft in the amount of $369 million in 2005. In addition, revenues decreased in Accounting differences/eliminations due to higher Commercial Airplanes intercompany deliveries in 2006. Consolidated revenues also increased in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase was due to the growth at Commercial Airplanes driven by higher new aircraft deliveries, increased spares and aircraft modifications, and higher used aircraft sales. IDS revenues remained stable in 2005 after strong growth in 2004. BCC revenues for 2005 were essentially unchanged from 2004. Earnings from Operations The following table summarizes our earnings from operations: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Commercial Airplanes $ 2,733 $ 1,431 $ 745 Integrated Defense Systems 3,032 3,919 2,936 Boeing Capital Corporation 291 232 183 Other (738 ) (363 ) (546 ) Unallocated expense (1,733 ) (2,407 ) (1,311 ) Global Settlement with U.S. Department of Justice (571 ) Earnings from operations $ 3,014 $ 2,812 $ 2,007 Our earnings from operations increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily driven by improved earnings at Commercial Airplanes and lower unallocated expense. This was partially offset by a $571 million charge for global settlement with U.S. Department of Justice (see Note 22), lower IDS earnings reflecting a $569 million net gain on the sale of our Rocketdyne business in 2005 and $770 million of charges on the Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) development program in 2006 partially offset by improved margins on other programs and a $320 million charge related to the exit of the Connexion by Boeing business recorded in Other segment (see Note 9). An increase in earnings from operations in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to strong operating performance by our business segments partially offset by higher unallocated expense. Included in 2004 results is a charge of $555 million related to the United States Air Force (USAF) 767 tanker program and expenses incurred to end production of the 717 aircraft. The most significant items included in Unallocated expense are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Pension and post retirement expense $ (472 ) $ (851 ) $ (258 ) Share based plans expense (680 ) (999 ) (627 ) Deferred compensation expense (211 ) (186 ) (54 ) Other (370 ) (371 ) (372 ) Unallocated expense $ (1,733 ) $ (2,407 ) $ (1,311 ) We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions of $1,050 million in 2006, $1,303 million in 2005, and $451 million in 2004. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the 19 Table of Contents end of the reporting period. Accordingly, earnings from operations included $746 million, $1,225 million and $335 million of pension expense in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. A portion of pension expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension expense. Unallocated pension and other post retirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under GAAP in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. Net periodic benefit cost related to pensions decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 mainly due to an absence of net settlement and curtailment charges partially offset by an increase in the amount of actuarial loss that was amortized. The increase in 2006 and 2005 deferred compensation plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price. Higher pension and post retirement amounts in 2005 compared to 2004 are primarily related to higher amortization of actuarial losses and net settlement and curtailment charges due to 2005 divestitures. The increase in 2005 share based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock. Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Earnings from operations $ 3,014 $ 2,812 $ 2,007 Other income, net 420 301 288 Interest and debt expense (240 ) (294 ) (335 ) Earnings before income taxes 3,194 2,819 1,960 Income tax expense (988 ) (257 ) (140 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 2,206 $ 2,562 $ 1,820 Other income primarily consists of interest income. Interest income was higher in 2006 and 2005 as a result of higher interest rates and higher cash and investment balances partially offset by lower interest income related to federal income tax settlements for prior years. Interest and debt expense decreased in 2006 and 2005 due to debt repayments. The effective income tax rate of 30.9% for 2006 differed from the 2005 effective income tax rate of 9.1% primarily due to the favorable 2005 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the non deduction in 2006 of the global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The effective income tax rate of 9.1% for 2005 was comparable to the 2004 effective income tax rate of 7.1%. Both 2005 and 2004 benefited from audit settlements and export tax benefits. 2006 is the final year for recognizing export tax benefits. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes see Note 6. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non U.S. government contract funding. Contractual backlog increased by $55,930 million in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increases at Commercial Airplanes of $50,144 million, which were primarily due to new orders in excess of deliveries for the 737NG, 747 and 787 airplanes, and increases at IDS of $5,786 million which were driven by funding received from new orders and existing contracts for C 17, F/A 18, Integrated Logistics Chinook support, and Proprietary. 20 Table of Contents Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Funding that is subsequently received is moved to contractual backlog. The decrease in IDS unobligated backlog of $10,584 million during 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to funding released from new orders and existing contracts on F/A 18, Future Combat Systems (FCS), C 17, and Proprietary. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Air travel growth is driven by a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Air traffic growth continues to exceed its long term trend due to strong performance of these key drivers. Global economic growth, the primary driver of air traffic growth, remained above long term trend for the third straight year in 2006. Evidence of increasing liberalization can be seen in the declining restrictions on flights between countries, increasing private ownership of airlines and reduced regulation of competition within markets. Looking forward, our 20 year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger traffic, and 6% per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increasing utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $2.6 trillion market for 27,200 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The airline industry is becoming increasingly competitive resulting in airlines focusing on increasing productivity and improving service levels. Airlines are changing many aspects of their operations including simplifying fleets, distribution, and pricing; outsourcing non essential operations; reducing labor costs and airport costs; increasing asset utilization; and developing new business models through innovations in network structure, fare structures, service levels and distribution networks. Such changes are providing new opportunities for airline industry suppliers. Worldwide, many airlines continue reporting operating profits although performance varies significantly by region and business model. Recent industry financials generally show increasing unit revenues and rising fares. Cost cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements are helping many airlines remain profitable despite intense competition and high fuel prices. Fuel costs now comprise one quarter of airline operating costs compared to less than 15% three years ago. Overall, the industry is forecast to lose half a billion dollars in 2006, but return to profitability in 2007. Many airlines that are growing to meet increased demand are acquiring new capacity from manufacturers. The industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian flu), the threat of terrorism, global economic imbalances, increasing global environmental concerns and fuel prices. Fuel prices are forecast to remain elevated and volatile in the near term due to strong demand driven by economic growth and minimal surplus capacity to cushion against supply shocks. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. 21 Table of Contents Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns. Approximately two thirds of Commercial Airplanes sales and contractual backlog are from customers based outside the United States. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100 seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies puts pressure on competitors revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer term competitive posture. Airbus has recently announced such initiatives targeting a two year reduction in its development cycle and a 20% increase in overall productivity by 2010. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, Airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins.

The years 2005 and 2004 were retroactively adjusted for comparative purposes. See Note 1. Revenues The increase in revenue of approximately $7,100 million in 2006 from 2005 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $6,820 million, increased aircraft modification and spares business of $873 million offset by $593 million primarily attributable to lower revenue from aircraft trading. The increase in revenue of $1,440 million in 2005 from 2004 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $845 million, used airplane sales of $302 million and $293 million primarily attributable to aircraft modification, and spares. Increased deliveries in 2005 were achieved despite delivering 29 fewer than expected airplanes due to the IAM strike during the month of September 2005. This resulted in approximately $2,000 million lower revenue than anticipated for 2005. 22 Table of Contents Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: 717 737 NG 747 757 767 777 Total 2006 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,136 1,380 1,049 947 604 Deliveries 5 (3) 302 * 14 12 * 65 398 2005 Cumulative Deliveries 150 1,834 1,366 1,049 935 539 Deliveries 13 (5) 212 * 13 2 10 * 40 290 2004 Cumulative Deliveries 137 1,622 1,353 1,047 925 499 Deliveries 12 (6) 202 * 15 11 9 (1) 36 285 * Intracompany deliveries were two 767 aircraft and eight 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2006, two 767 aircraft and two 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2005 and three 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2004. Earnings from Operations The $1,302 million increase in earnings from operations in 2006 over the comparable period of 2005 was primarily attributable to earnings of $1,781 million on increased revenue from new aircraft deliveries and $315 million in increased earnings primarily attributable to aircraft modifications. In addition cost performance improved by $226 million. Such items were offset by increased research and development costs of $1,088 million. In 2005 we had a loss on the sale of Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma operations of $68 million. The IAM strike resulted in lower operating earnings in 2005 due to 29 fewer than expected airplane deliveries. The $686 million increase in earnings from operations in 2005 over the comparable period of 2004 was primarily attributable to earnings on increased revenue from new aircraft deliveries of $265 million and $135 million of increased revenue primarily attributable to aircraft modification. In addition, margin improved $414 million mainly due to improved cost performance, which was offset by increased research and development costs of $361 million and other period costs of $174 million, and a loss on the sale of Wichita, Tulsa and McAlester operations of $68 million. In 2004, we also had charges of $280 million resulting from the decision to complete production of the 717 program and $195 million of the 767 USAF Tanker program charge. Backlog The backlog increase in 2006 related to orders in excess of deliveries for 737NG, 747 and 787, while the increase in 2005 related to orders in excess of deliveries for 737NG, 777 and 787. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. 23 Table of Contents The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: Program 717 737 NG 747 757 767 777 787 2006 Program accounting quantities 156 3,200 1,449 1,050 985 900 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 1,560 116 28 299 448 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 155 3,696 1,496 1,049 975 903 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 8 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 1 % N/A 2005 Program accounting quantities 156 2,800 1,424 1,050 971 800 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 5 1,123 58 30 288 287 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 2 155 2,957 1,424 1,049 965 827 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 3 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 0 % N/A 2004 Program accounting quantities 156 2,400 1,400 1,050 959 700 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 18 771 27 2 25 167 52 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 2 155 2,393 1,380 1,049 950 666 Anticipated orders N/A 5 19 N/A 6 34 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A 0 % 1 % N/A 1 % 5 % * The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2008. 1 Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its Board of Directors, shareholders, government and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights. 2 Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 737 Next Generation The accounting quantity for the 737 Next Generation program increased by 400 units during 2006 due to the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program In November 2005, we launched the 747 8 family, which includes the 747 8 Intercontinental passenger airplane and the 747 8 Freighter. This launch and additional firm orders have extended the life of this program and have also solidified product strategy. The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units during 2006. During 2006 we completed firm configuration of the 747 8 freighter and the same is expected for the passenger version in 2007. Deliveries of the first 747 8 freighter and intercontinental passenger airplane are targeted for late 2009 and late 2010. 767 Program During 2005 and 2006 the 767 program obtained additional orders, including 10 firm orders during 2006. In addition, on February 5, 2007, a customer announced its plans to order 27 767 300 Extended Range Freighters. We continue pursuing market opportunities for additional 767 sales. 24 Table of Contents 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2006 as a result of the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 787 Program As we progress toward first flight and entry into service of the 787, we continue to manage pressures with respect to weight, schedule, and supplier implementation as they arise. There are inherent risks associated with the development and production of any new airplane, which can impact expectations. But we still continue to expect delivery of the 787 on schedule and in accordance with our contractual obligations. We are preparing for the first test flight of the 787 in 2007, and for entry into service in 2008. A key milestone of the program was achieved in 2006 with the initial flight of the first 747 400 Large Cargo Freighter (LCF), called the DreamLifter. These specially modified freighters will transport major composite structures of the 787 airplanes. Other key events during 2006 were the first shipment of a major assembly between supplier partners and the introduction of a digital computer simulation of the entire 787 production and assembly process. Completed programs 717 Program On January 12, 2005, we announced our decision to complete production of the 717 aircraft during 2006 due to the lack of overall market demand. The final 717 was delivered in the second quarter of 2006. 757 Program Production of the 757 program ended in October 2004. The last aircraft was delivered in the second quarter of 2005. For additional information regarding termination liabilities remaining in Accounts payable and other liabilities for these two programs see Note 23. Deferred production costs Deferred production costs represent commercial aircraft inventory production costs incurred on in process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units using program accounting. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005 deferred production costs relate to the 777 program and there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders. The deferred production costs and unamortized tooling included in the 777 programs inventory at December 31 are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Deferred production costs $ 871 $ 683 Unamortized tooling 329 411 As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to all other commercial aircraft programs was insignificant relative to the programs balance to go cost estimates. Fleet support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. 25 Table of Contents Research and development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense increased $1,088 million and $361 million in 2006 and 2005. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The increase in 2006 was due to higher spending of $636 million, primarily on 787 and 747 8, and $452 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. The increase during 2005 was primarily due to increased spending on the 787 program and was partially offset by supplier development cost sharing payments. During the second and third quarters of 2006, we increased our research and development expense forecasts for 2006 and 2007 to reflect increasing pressures on the 787 program as well as modified and increased scope on the 747 8 program to support customer expectations. We are also continuing to develop derivatives and features for our other programs primarily the 737 and 777 programs. Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS consists of three capabilities driven businesses: Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems (PE&MS), Network and Space Systems (N&SS), and Support Systems. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. is faced with continuous force deployments overseas, stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the requirement both to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report (QDR). All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant Federal budget deficits and an administration pledge to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade. Because U.S. DoD spending makes up about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately 84% of IDS revenue in 2006, the trends and drivers associated with the U.S. DoD budget are critical. The U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, particularly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although the growth rate had moderated in recent years, the 2008 submittal equates to an 11% increase over the projected 2007 enacted level. The Presidents request for fiscal year 2008 is $481 billion, excluding the additional $142 billion request to continue the fight in the Global War on Terror (GWOT) in fiscal year 2008. In the past emergency supplementals had been used to cover the on going costs of the GWOT. In addition to the fiscal year 2008 budget request the President also submitted a fiscal year 2007 Emergency Supplemental requesting $93 billion to cover operations in the GWOT for the remainder of fiscal year 2007. This Supplemental is in addition to the $70 billion previously provided by Congress. The Procurement account continues to see growth with a request of $102 billion, a 25% increase over 2007, while the 26 Table of Contents Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) account remains flat at $75 billion. (All projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account and without accounting for Supplemental funding.) Even though we continue to see some growth in the U.S. DoD budget, it is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the 2006 QDR. This imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness, network centric operations, persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, long range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons, and continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Consolidation of contractor provided U.S. Government launch capabilities was completed with the formation of the United Launch Alliance L.L.C. (ULA) joint venture in 2006. This consolidation was driven by the limited schedule of government launches as well as the downturn in the commercial launch market. Launch contractors had built business cases around the government market being supplemented by a robust commercial market, but as the commercial market declined these business cases were re evaluated. The U.S. Government has an assured access to space policy which requires that two separate vehicles be available for use. The ULA joint venture is intended to provide this assurance. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment NASA has had stable but very little growth in their funding in this decade. NASAs fiscal year 2006 appropriation of $16.6 billion was approximately equal to the fiscal year 2005 funding level, and presently the agency is operating under a Continuing Resolution in 2007. NASAs budget remains focused on needed funds for Space Shuttle Operations, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. We anticipate funding levels to remain in the $16 billion range in the near future. NASA is continuing to pursue elements of the Vision for Space Exploration, which will provide additional opportunities. Commercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade. The market remains extremely competitive however, with overcapacity across the overall industry and strong pressure on pricing. We will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions. Integrated Defense Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 32,439 $ 31,106 $ 30,739 % of Total Company Revenues 53 % 58 % 60 % Operating Earnings $ 3,032 $ 3,919 $ 2,936 Operating Margins 9.3 % 12.6 % 9.6 % Research and Development $ 791 $ 855 $ 834 Contractual Backlog $ 42,291 $ 36,505 $ 39,296 Unobligated Backlog $ 33,424 $ 44,008 $ 47,472 27 Table of Contents Since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts, or as one large multi year order or long term award. As a result, period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues IDS revenues increased 4% in 2006 and 1% in 2005 as growth in both PE&MS and Support Systems was partially offset by lower volume in N&SS. Operating Earnings IDS operating earnings decreased by $887 million in 2006 from 2005 reflecting a $569 million net gain on the sale of Rocketdyne in 2005 and $770 million of charges on the AEW&C development program in 2006 partially offset by improved margins on other programs. Operating earnings increased by $983 million in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to the net gain on the Rocketdyne sale in 2005 in addition to stable performance in the commercial satellite business compared to 2004, when losses were recorded resulting from cost growth due to technical and quality issues and write downs of slow moving inventory. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. IDS total backlog decreased 6% in 2006, from $80,513 million to $75,715 million, primarily due to decreases in unobligated backlog of $10,584 million which resulted from funding released from new orders and existing contracts on F/A 18, FCS, C 17, and Proprietary, offset by increases in contractual backlog of $5,786 million which were driven by funding received from new orders and existing contracts for C 17, F/A 18, Integrated Logistics Chinook support, and Proprietary. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Ground based Midcourse Defense (GMD), FCS, P 8A (P 8A, formerly Multi mission Maritime Aircraft), Proprietary programs, Airborne Laser, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Family of Beyond Line of Sight Terminals, and the E/A 18G. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed, which could trigger termination for default provisions, the loss of satellite on orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEW&C, 767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation. 28 Table of Contents Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 14,350 $ 13,510 $ 12,835 % of Total Company Revenues 23 % 25 % 25 % Operating Earnings $ 1,238 $ 1,755 $ 1,697 Operating Margins 8.6 % 13.0 % 13.2 % Research and Development $ 404 $ 440 $ 420 Contractual Backlog $ 24,988 $ 21,815 $ 21,539 Unobligated Backlog $ 9,194 $ 15,189 $ 20,885 Revenues PE&MS revenues increased 6% in 2006 and 5% in 2005 primarily due to additional aircraft deliveries and other volume. The revenue growth of $840 million in 2006 was driven by higher deliveries of F 15 and Apache and higher volume of P 8A, F 22, and Chinook, partially offset by reduced revenues of AEW&C. The revenue growth of $675 million in 2005 was driven by higher deliveries on F 15 and Apache and higher volume and milestone completions on P 8A and AEW&C, partially offset by fewer deliveries on F/A 18 and lower volume resulting from the Comanche termination. Deliveries of new build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 C 17 Globemaster III 16 16 16 F/A 18E/F Super Hornet 42 42 48 T 45 Training Systems 13 10 7 F 15 Eagle 12 6 3 CH 47 Chinook 2 C 40 Clipper 1 2 3 AH 64 Apache 31 12 3 Total New Build Production Aircraft 117 88 80 Operating Earnings PE&MS operating earnings decreased $517 million in 2006 driven by the $770 million AEW&C charges mentioned above, which were partially offset by earnings from revenue growth, favorable contract mix, and reduced Company Sponsored Research & Development (CSR&D) expenditures on the 767 Tanker program. Operating earnings increased 3% in 2005 driven by earnings from revenue growth and reduced CSR&D expenditures on 767 Tankers in 2005 and charges recorded in 2004 to write off pre contract development costs on the 767 USAF Tanker program. Research and Development The PE&MS segment continues to focus its research and development resources where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large scale integration capabilities to provide transformational solutions to meet the war fighters enduring needs. Research and Development has remained consistent over the past several years. Research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures, system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers capabilities in the areas of situational awareness and survivability. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability, and improving affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Continued research and development investments in unmanned technology and systems have enabled the demonstration of multi vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high performance unmanned combat air vehicles. Research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes, among other things, precision guidance and multi mode targeting. Research and development investments in the Global Tanker Transport Aircraft program represent a significant 29 Table of Contents opportunity to provide state of the art refueling capabilities to domestic and non U.S. customers. Investments were also made to support various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance business opportunities including P 8A and AEW&C aircraft. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the F/A 18E/F Super Hornet, F 15E Eagle, AH 64 Apache, CH 47 Chinook and C 17 Globemaster III. Backlog PE&MS total backlog decreased 8% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to deliveries and sales on F/A 18 and F 15 from multi year contracts awarded in prior years. Total backlog decreased 13% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to deliveries and sales on C 17, F/A 18 and P 8A, and partially offset by additional F 15 and Chinook orders. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on PE&MS operations include the following: AEW&C During 2006 we recorded charges of $770 million on our international Airborne Early Warning and Control program. This development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia and Peace Eagle in Turkey, consists of a 737 700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle includes four aircraft. This is an advanced and complex fixed price development program involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. The second quarter charge of $496 million included estimated additional program costs and reductions in expected pricing caused by technical complexities which resulted in schedule delays and cost growth and increased the risk of late delivery penalties. The financial impact recorded in that quarter resulted from a detailed analysis of flight test data along with a series of additional rigorous technical and cost reviews after flight testing ramped up. The hardware and software development and integration had not progressed as quickly as we planned, resulting in the delivery for the first two aircraft being delayed 15 months. We reorganized the program to improve systems engineering and integration and we strengthened the leadership team in both program management and engineering. In the fourth quarter of 2006, after a revised estimate of technical progress by us and our subcontractors, we determined that program subsystems and software development had not matured as we had anticipated earlier in the year. We recorded a charge of an additional $274 million, reflecting further program delays of up to six months. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the most recent cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed. C 17 As of December 31, 2006, we have delivered a total of 159 of the 190 C 17s ordered by the U.S. Air Force, with final deliveries scheduled for 2009. Despite pending orders, which would extend deliveries of the C 17 to mid 2009, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2007 to suspend work on long lead items from suppliers and or to complete production of the C 17 if further orders are not received. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a production shut down, including any recovery that would be available from the government. 767 Tanker Program The 767 Tanker Program has orders for eight 767 Tankers, four from the Italian Air Force and four from the Japan Self Defense Agency. The USAF is continuing to pursue a replacement for the KC 135 tanker and has identified it as its top acquisition priority for 2007. In addition, the Pentagon requested funding for the development phase of the program in its 2008 budget request in February 2007. We remain firmly committed to the USAF Tanker program and are ready to support our customer in whatever decision is made regarding the recapitalization of the nations current aerial refueling fleet. 30 Table of Contents Network and Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 11,980 $ 12,254 $ 13,023 % of Total Company Revenues 19 % 23 % 25 % Operating Earnings $ 958 $ 1,399 $ 577 Operating Margins 8.0 % 11.4 % 4.4 % Research and Development $ 301 $ 334 $ 357 Contractual Backlog $ 8,001 $ 6,324 $ 10,923 Unobligated Backlog $ 23,723 $ 27,634 $ 25,019 Revenues N&SS revenues decreased 2% in 2006 and 6% in 2005 as significant growth in FCS and higher Delta IV volume were offset by lower volume in Proprietary and GMD as well as the divestiture of our Rocketdyne business. Additional impacts resulted from fewer milestone completions in our commercial satellite business in 2006 and the completion of a Homeland Security contract in 2005. Launch and new build satellite deliveries were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Delta II 2 2 4 Delta IV 3 Commercial/Civil Satellites 4 3 2 Operating Earnings N&SS operating earnings decreased $441 million from 2005 to 2006 and increased $822 million from 2004 to 2005 driven by significant items in all three periods. The decrease from 2005 to 2006 was driven by the $569 million net gain on the Rocketdyne sale and higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005, partially offset by increased earnings in the FCS program in 2006. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was driven by the favorable Rocketdyne and Delta IV impacts in 2005 mentioned above, while losses were recorded in our commercial satellite business in 2004 caused by performance issues due to cost growth from technical and quality issues and write offs of slow moving inventory. N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $71 million, $72 million, and $70 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Divestitures On February 28, 2005, we completed the stock sale of EDD to L 3 Communications. On August 2, 2005 we completed the sale of our Rocketdyne business to United Technologies Corporation. See Note 9 Exit Activity and Divestitures. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications and command and control capabilities that support a network centric architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include JTRS, FCS, GPS, and Transformational Communications System. Investments were also made to support concepts that will lead to the development of next generation space intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network centric capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. Backlog N&SS total backlog decreased 7% from 2005 to 2006 driven by sales from a multi year order received in prior years on FCS. Total backlog decreased 6% from 2004 to 2005 driven by sales from multi year orders received in prior years on GMD and FCS, partially offset by new orders on Proprietary programs. 31 Table of Contents Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on N&SS operations include the following: United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we completed the transaction with Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) to create a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. (ULA). ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. In connection with the transaction, we contributed assets and liabilities of $1,609 million and $695 million, respectively, to ULA. These amounts are subject to adjustment pending final review of the respective parties contributions. Any difference between the book value of our investment and our proportionate share of ULAs net assets would be recognized ratably in future years. We also entered into an inventory supply agreement with ULA that provides for the purchase by ULA from us of Boeing Delta inventories totaling $1,860 million by March 31, 2021. We and Lockheed each will provide ULA with initial cash contributions of up to $25 million, and we each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements. In connection with the transaction, we and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. Government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non recoverability of $1,375 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to the inventory supply agreement. In addition, in the event ULA is unable to obtain re pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ULA and to which we believe ULA is entitled, we will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to $322 million in pre tax losses. ULA is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. N&SS 2006 revenues include $727 million related to Delta rockets and formation of ULA will reduce N&SS revenues in 2007. We do not expect ULA to have a material impact to our earnings, cash flows, or financial position for 2007. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the venture conducted five successful launches. We have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we believe we can recover a portion of the cost (estimated at $486 million) through guarantees from the other venture partners. The components of this exposure are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) EstimatedMaximumExposure EstablishedReserves EstimatedProceedsfromRecourse EstimatedNetExposure Credit Guarantees $ 471 $ 188 $ 283 Partner Loans (Principal and Interest) 451 271 180 Advances to Provide for Future Launches 76 $ 76 Trade Receivable from Sea Launch 311 289 22 Performance Guarantees 33 20 13 Other Receivables from Sea Launch 45 38 3 4 $ 1,387 $ 786 $ 486 $ 115 We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2006. We suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to Sea Launch down to zero in 2001 and accruing our obligation for third party guarantees on Sea Launch indebtedness. We 32 Table of Contents are not obligated to provide any further financial support to the Sea Launch venture. However, in the event that we do extend additional financial support to Sea Launch in the future, we will recognize suspended losses as appropriate. A Sea Launch Zenit 3SL vehicle, carrying a Boeing built satellite, experienced an anomaly during launch on January 30, 2007. The impact to Sea Launch operations, including the remaining launches scheduled for 2007 is not yet known. Based on our preliminary assessment, we do not believe that this anomaly will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Satellites The Boeing built NSS 8 satellite was declared a total loss due to an anomaly during launch on January 30, 2007. The NSS 8 satellite was insured for $200 million. We believe the NSS 8 loss was the result of an insured event and have so notified our insurance carriers. See the discussions of Boeing Satellite International, Inc. (BSSI) litigation/arbitration with ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd., Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications, Telesat Canada, and Space Communications Corporation in Note 22. Support Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 6,109 $ 5,342 $ 4,881 % of Total Company Revenues 10 % 10 % 10 % Operating Earnings $ 836 $ 765 $ 662 Operating Margins 13.7 % 14.3 % 13.6 % Research and Development $ 86 $ 81 $ 57 Contractual Backlog $ 9,302 $ 8,366 $ 6,834 Unobligated Backlog $ 507 $ 1,185 $ 1,568 Revenues Support Systems revenues increased 14% in 2006 and 9% in 2005 driven by growth throughout the segment. The increase of $767 million in 2006 was due to higher Integrated Logistics (IL) volume on programs such as C 17 and increased program volume resulting from Aviall, which we acquired in the third quarter; higher International program volume resulting from our increased ownership in Alsalam Aircraft Co. (Alsalam); and volume on Maintenance, Modification, & Upgrade (MM&U) programs such as AC 130. The increase of $461 million in 2005 was due to higher volume on MM&U programs such as F 15 and AC 130 and IL programs such as Chinook and C 17. In the second quarter of 2006 we increased our ownership interest in Alsalam, which operates as a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul facility for various military and commercial aircraft. As a result, we began consolidating Alsalams financial statements, which generated revenues of $137 million during the last three quarters of 2006. Operating Earnings Support Systems operating earnings increased 9% in 2006 and 16% in 2005 driven by the revenue increases mentioned above in addition to a different contract mix. Research and Development Support Systems continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including Engineering and Logistic Services, MM&U, Supply Chain Services, Training and Support Systems, and Advanced Logistics Services, as well as on moving into the innovative Network Centric Logistics areas. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative and disciplined tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these 33 Table of Contents investment strategies include the C 17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A 18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, and the F 15 Singapore Performance Based Logistics contract. Backlog Support Systems total backlog increased 3% from 2005 to 2006 driven by a large IL order for Chinook support. Total backlog increased 14% from 2004 to 2005 driven by orders for new business offsetting sales on various IL programs. Boeing Capital Corporation Segment Business Environment and Trends BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2006 totaled $8,034 million, which was substantially collateralized by our commercial aircraft. While worldwide traffic levels are well above those in the past, the effects of higher fuel prices continue to impact the airline industry. At the same time, the credit ratings of some airlines, particularly in the United States, have remained at low levels. Despite positive factors including passenger load at record high levels, a limited supply of economically viable used aircraft and, increasing lease rates, values as measured by reference to published reports from multiple external appraisers for the various aircraft types that are collateral in BCCs portfolio generally have not increased. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,850 commercial jet aircraft (9.9% of current world fleet) continue to be parked, including both in production and out of production aircraft types of which over 50% are not expected to return to service. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. At December 31, 2006, $2,590 million and $1,171 million of BCCs portfolio was collateralized by 717 and 757 aircraft. During 2006, BCC recognized an expense of $15 million to increase the valuation allowance resulting from a decrease in the collateral value of the 717 aircraft. See Note 10. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 1,025 $ 966 $ 959 Operating Earnings $ 291 $ 232 $ 183 Operating Margins 28 % 24 % 19 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of interest from financing receivables and notes, and lease income from equipment under operating lease. BCCs revenues increased $59 million in 2006, primarily due to an increase in investment income of $40 million from the sale or repayment at maturity of certain investments and a higher gain on the sale of aircraft and certain investments in notes receivable of $23 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in interest and lease income due to decreases in the weighted average balance of the related portfolio. BCCs revenues were essentially unchanged in 2005 compared with 2004. Operating earnings BCCs operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings increased by $59 million in 2006 primarily due to increased revenues. The increase in operating earnings in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to a lower asset impairment expense and the absence of debt redemption costs partially offset by increased depreciation expense. 34 Table of Contents Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC: (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 8,034 $ 9,206 Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables 2.4 % 2.0 % Debt $ 5,590 $ 6,322 Debt to Equity Ratio 5.0 to 1 5.0 to 1 BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2006 decreased from December 31, 2005 due to portfolio run off and sale of certain portfolio assets. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, BCC had $259 million and $47 million of assets that were held for sale or re lease of which $253 million and $6 million had firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, leases with a carrying value of approximately $144 million are scheduled to terminate in the next 12 months and the related aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. Finance Restructurings Delta Air Lines, Inc. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta) accounted for $135 million and $161 million of BCCs total assets. At December 31, 2006, the Delta portfolio consisted of an investment in an Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) secured by 12 aircraft. Delta retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As of December 31, 2006, Delta has made the contractually required payments relating to the remaining EETC held by BCC. BCC does not expect that the Delta bankruptcy, including the possible return of some or all of the aircraft financed, will have a material effect on its future earnings, cash flows and or financial position. Northwest Airlines, Inc. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Northwest Airlines, Inc. (Northwest) accounted for $349 million and $494 million of BCCs total assets. At December 31, 2006, the Northwest portfolio consisted of notes receivable on six aircraft and two additional notes receivable. Northwest retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On November 8, 2006, the bankruptcy court approved the restructured terms of certain obligations relating to the notes receivable. At December 31, 2006, Northwest is current on payments relating to the notes receivable held by BCC. We do not expect the Northwest bankruptcy, including the impact of any restructurings, to have a material effect on our future earnings, cash flows and or financial position. In addition to the customers discussed above, certain other customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and or financial position. Other Segment Other segment operating losses were $738 million during 2006 as compared to losses of $363 million in 2005. Major factors contributing to operating results of the segment are described below. During the third quarter of 2006, we announced that we would exit the Connexion by Boeing high speed broadband communications business having completed a detailed business and market 35 Table of Contents analysis. Our decision resulted in a pre tax charge of $320 million (See Note 9). We have not reached final settlements with all customers or suppliers. We do not believe the final settlements will have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and or financial position. In 2006, the Other segment recorded valuation allowances for customer financing losses of $24 million due to deteriorated airline credit ratings and depressed aircraft values. In 2005, such provisions were $98 million, which consisted of losses of $76 million and $22 million, due to decreases in the collateral values of the 717 and 757, respectively. In 2006, the Other segment recorded an increase in environmental expense of $68 million primarily related to a write down of previously capitalized environmental costs. In 2005, the Other segment recognized earnings of $63 million associated with the buyout of several operating lease aircraft by a customer. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net earnings $ 2,215 $ 2,572 $ 1,872 Non cash items 3,097 3,494 3,126 Changes in working capital 2,187 934 (1,494 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 7,499 7,000 3,504 Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities (3,186 ) (98 ) (1,446 ) Net cash used by financing activities (3,645 ) (4,657 ) (3,487 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 38 (37 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 706 2,208 (1,429 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 5,412 3,204 4,633 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 6,118 $ 5,412 $ 3,204 Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $499 million to $7,499 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to working capital improvements which were partially offset by lower Net earnings. The working capital improvements in 2006 compared with 2005 reflect $1,340 million of lower pension contributions in 2006. Working capital reductions in 2006 also reflect higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders, decreased investment in customer financing, and low income tax payments which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liability. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $7,000 million in 2005 from $3,504 million in 2004 primarily due to lower pension contributions, decreased investment in customer financing, and higher advances and billings in excess of related costs, partially offset by increased investment in inventories. Investing activities Cash used for investing activities increased to $3,186 million in 2006 from $98 million in 2005. The increase is primarily due to our investment of $1,738 million in the 2006 acquisition of Aviall, Inc. (Aviall), net of $42 million of cash acquired, and $458 million of assumed debt, in an all cash merger. The assumed debt was subsequently repaid on the acquisition closing date. In 2005, we received proceeds of $1,676 million, primarily from the disposition of our Commercial Airplanes 36 Table of Contents operations in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, and the sale of Rocketdyne. In 2004, we received proceeds of $2,017 million from the sale of substantially all of the assets related to BCCs Commercial Financial Services business. During 2004, we invested $3,000 million of cash in an externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments. The portfolio is diversified and highly liquid and primarily consists of investment fixed income instruments (U.S. dollar debt obligations of the United States Treasury, other government agencies, corporations, mortgage backed and asset backed securities). As of December 31, 2006, our externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments had an average duration of 1.6 years. The investments are classified as available for sale. Financing activities Cash used by financing activities decreased to $3,645 million in 2006 from $4,657 million in 2005 primarily due to lower common share repurchases. Cash used by financing activities increased by $1,170 million in 2005 from $3,487 million in 2004 primarily due to a $2,125 million increase in common share repurchases partially offset by lower debt repayments. During 2006, we repurchased 21,184,202 shares at an average price of $80.18 in our open market share repurchase program, 3,749,377 shares at an average price of $80.28 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 49,288 shares in stock swaps. During 2005 and 2004, 45,217,300 shares and 14,708,856 shares were repurchased at an average price of $63.60 and $51.09 in our open market share repurchase program, and 33,660 shares and 50,657 shares were repurchased in stock swaps. In 2006, we repaid $1,681 million of debt, including $713 million of debt held at BCC and $458 million of debt assumed in the Aviall acquisition. In 2005 and 2004, we repaid $1,378 million and $2,208 million of debt. Repayments in 2004 included BCCs redemption of $1,000 million face value of its outstanding senior notes, which had a carrying value of $999 million. BCC recognized a net loss of $42 million related to this early debt redemption. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moodys Standard &Poors Long term: Boeing/BCC A+ A2 A+ Short term: Boeing/BCC F 1 P 1 A 1 On March 15, 2006, Moodys Investors Service upgraded its ratings on debt securities issued by Boeing and BCC. The short term rating was changed to P 1 from P 2 and the long term rating was changed to A2 from A3. On May 11, 2006, Standard & Poors revised its outlook on Boeing and BCC to positive from stable. On November 3, 2006, Standard & Poors increased the long term debt ratings for Boeing and BCC to A+ from A, citing substantial cash flow and expectations that a balanced capital allocation will continue to be pursued. Capital Resources We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity. Throughout 2006 and at December 31, 2006, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We believe we have substantial borrowing capacity. Currently, we have $3,000 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. In 2006, we rolled over the 364 day revolving credit facility, reducing it from $1,500 million to $1,000 million. 37 Table of Contents Currently, there is $500 million allocated to BCC. We also rolled over the 5 year credit facility, increasing it from $1,500 million to $2,000 million, of which $1,000 million is allocated to BCC. We have $1,000 million that remains available from a shelf registration filed with the SEC on March 23, 2004, and BCC has an additional $3,421 million available for issuance, which is due to expire in November 2008. We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. We and Lockheed have agreed to make available to ULA a line of credit in the amount of up to $200 million each as may be necessary from time to time to support ULAs Expendable Launch Vehicle business during the five year period following December 1, 2006. ULA did not request any funds under the line of credit as of December 31, 2006. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158), which required recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, with a corresponding after tax adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The adoption of SFAS 158, together with the annual remeasurement of our pension plans, resulted in a net $6,509 million decrease in Shareholders equity. This decrease does not affect cash flows or the funded status of our benefit plans. The covenants for our debt and credit facilities were amended to exclude the impacts of SFAS No. 158. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2006, and the estimated timing thereof. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 13years 35years After 5years Long term debt (including current portion) $ 9,405 $ 1,322 $ 1,260 $ 1,519 $ 5,304 Interest on debt* 6,195 557 992 814 3,832 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 7,330 675 1,432 1,549 3,674 Capital lease obligations 153 59 31 20 43 Operating lease obligations 1,064 239 301 164 360 Purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position 86,254 34,926 35,076 11,940 4,312 Purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position 10,632 9,394 518 344 376 Total contractual obligations $ 121,033 $ 47,172 $ 39,610 $ 16,350 $ 17,901 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2006. Variable rate debt was approximately 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2006. Pension and other postretirement benefits Pension cash requirements is an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contribution to the one plan that is funded through a trust. 38 Table of Contents Purchase obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 16% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts. Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial participation agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2006, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2006, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $7.7 billion that extend through 2019. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a country outside the U.S. or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 19. 39 Table of Contents Commercial commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 4,368 $ 2,849 $ 1,381 $ 3 $ 135 Aircraft financing commercial commitments 10,164 1,534 5,525 3,025 80 Total commercial commitments $ 14,532 $ 4,383 $ 6,906 $ 3,028 $ 215 Related to the issuance of certain standby letters of credit and surety bonds included in the above table, we received advance payments of $2,869 million as of December 31, 2006. Aircraft financing commercial commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option for deliveries based on estimated earliest funding dates. Based on historical experience, it is not anticipated that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers (See Note 19). Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita, Kansas and Fulton County, Georgia to finance the purchase and or construction of real and personal property (See Note 19). Critical Accounting Policies and Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. Government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contracts sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the 40 Table of Contents underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2006 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1.0%, it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately $324 million. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the forecasted market and corresponding production rates. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are recognized on a prospective basis. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2006 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for 2006 by approximately $243 million. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade in commitments The fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such as, model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. Trade in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. This process begins years before the return of the aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. 41 Table of Contents Based on the best market information available at the time, it is probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade in commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $19 million and $72 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Accounts payable and other liabilities included $22 million at December 31, 2005, which represents the exposure related to these trade in commitments. Had the estimate of trade in value used to calculate our obligation related to probable trade in commitments been 10% lower than our actual assessment, using a measurement date of December 31, 2006, Accounts payable and other liabilities would have increased by approximately $2 million. We continually update our assessment of the likelihood of our trade in aircraft purchase commitments and continue to monitor all these commitments for adverse developments. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re lease When events or circumstances indicate, we evaluate assets under operating lease or held for re lease for impairment utilizing an expected undiscounted cash flow analysis. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intention to hold or dispose of an asset before the end of its economic useful life, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the aircraft or equipment, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of asset impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on these assets we evaluate for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that no additional impairment expense would have been recognized as of December 31, 2006. We are unable to predict the likelihood of any future impairments. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing, however, the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market. Allowance for losses on receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of reasonably possible and probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit reviews. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Had the applicable cumulative default rate been changed by plus or minus 15%, excluding impaired customers for which the default rate is maintained at 100%, we estimate that the allowance would have been higher or lower by approximately $34 million. Lease residual values Equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the lease term or projected economic life of the asset. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases. For example, a change in the estimated residual values of 1% as of December 31, 2006 could result in a cumulative pre tax earnings impact of $20 million to be recognized over time. 42 Table of Contents Goodwill impairment Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of our previous impairment test, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements. Postretirement plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all our employees. We also have postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the expected long term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense. In addition, as result of our adoption of SFAS 158, changes in assumptions could significantly increase or decrease Shareholders Equity (net of taxes) at future measurement dates. We use a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of our September 30 annual measurement date. Changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to Shareholders Equity as of the measurement date. In future reporting periods, the adjustment for a change in the discount rate will be recognized in Other comprehensive loss in the period in which it occurs. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2006 (in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Dollars Dollars Projected benefit obligation (pensions) (1,271 ) 1,555 Net periodic pension cost (145 ) 165 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (181 ) 212 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (14 ) 15 43 Table of Contents Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2006 pension income by approximately $108 million. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return are reflected in Shareholders Equity (net of taxes) as of our annual measurement date. In future reporting periods, the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return will be recognized in Other comprehensive loss in the period in which it occurs. The assumed medical trend rates have a significant affect on the following years expense recorded liabilities and Shareholders Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change. As of September 30, 2006 (in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 683 (652 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 127 (116 ) Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented See Note 2 in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Contingent Items Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance. Major contingencies are discussed in Note 22, including our contesting the default termination of the A 12 aircraft, employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees, and litigation/arbitration involving BSSI. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally investments, fixed rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes. Additionally, Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC) uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. The principal source of BCCs market risk relates to interest rate changes. This risk is managed by matching the profile of BCCs liabilities with the profile of assets. Any exposure to mismatch risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives. We do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Although many of the assets, liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded, if we had an immediate, one time, 100 basis point increase in market rates at December 31, 2006, we estimated that the tax adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by $9 million compared to a decrease of $15 million at December 31, 2005. 44 Table of Contents Based on the portfolio of other Boeing existing debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2006, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by $69 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 45 Table of Contents
