Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second largest defense contractor in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world. Our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses Commercial Airplanes and Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications and space to deliver capability driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others cyclicality. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. In 2007, our revenues grew by 8%. Earnings from operations increased 93%. We continued to invest in key growth programs as Research and Development expense grew by 18% to $3.9 billion, reflecting increased spending on the 787 and 747 8 programs and lower cost sharing payments from suppliers. We generated operating cash flow of $9.6 billion driven by operating and working capital performance. We reduced debt by $1.3 billion and repurchased 29 million common shares. Our contractual backlog grew 37% to $297 billion, driven by 46% growth at Commercial Airplanes while our total backlog grew 31% to $327 billion. We expect continued growth in Commercial Airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand by ramping up commercial aircraft production. We expect IDS revenue to remain relatively flat in 2008 compared with 2007 and anticipate that the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) budget growth will begin to moderate over the next several years. We are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer focused growth. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Commercial Airplanes $ 33,386 $ 28,465 $ 21,365 Integrated Defense Systems 32,080 32,439 31,106 Boeing Capital Corporation 815 1,025 966 Other 280 299 657 Accounting differences/eliminations (174 ) (698 ) (473 ) Revenues $ 66,387 $ 61,530 $ 53,621 19 Table of Contents Revenues in 2007 grew by $4,857 million, primarily due to the growth at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $4,921 million, primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and increased commercial aviation support activities. IDS revenues decreased by $359 million, primarily due to lower revenues in Network and Space Systems (N&SS) resulting from the formation of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture in 2006 and lower revenues in Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems (PE&MS), offset by growth in Support Systems. BCC revenues decreased by $210 million primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Accounting differences/eliminations changed by $524 million primarily due to fewer Commercial Airplanes intercompany deliveries when compared with 2006. Higher consolidated revenues in 2006 were primarily due to higher new commercial aircraft deliveries. IDS revenues were up moderately in 2006 as growth in PE&MS and Support Systems was partially offset by lower volume in N&SS. BCC revenues increased in 2006 primarily due to higher investment income and higher net gain on disposal of assets. Other segment revenues decreased in 2006 as a result of the buyout of several operating lease aircraft in the amount of $369 million in 2005. Accounting differences/eliminations decreased revenues due to higher Commercial Airplanes intercompany deliveries in 2006. Earnings from Operations The following table summarizes our earnings from operations: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Commercial Airplanes $ 3,584 $ 2,733 $ 1,431 Integrated Defense Systems 3,440 3,032 3,919 Boeing Capital Corporation 234 291 232 Other (243 ) (738 ) (363 ) Unallocated Expense (1,185 ) (1,733 ) (2,407 ) Settlement with U.S. Department of Justice, net of accruals (571 ) Earnings from operations $ 5,830 $ 3,014 $ 2,812 Operating earnings in 2007 improved by $2,816 million compared with 2006. The increase is partly due to the $571 million global settlement with U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DoJ) that occurred in the second quarter of 2006. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $851 million compared with the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, commercial aviation support activities and improved cost performance offset by increased research and development expense. Commercial Airplanes research and development expense increased by $572 million to $2,962 million compared with the same period 2006, primarily due to spending on the 787 and 747 8 programs. IDS earnings increased by $408 million compared with 2006. The increase is primarily due to 2006 charges of $770 million in the PE&MS segment related to Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C), partially offset by lower 2007 earnings on several programs in the PE&MS and N&SS segments. BCC operating earnings decreased $57 million reflecting lower revenues partially offset by a recovery of losses and lower expenses. Other segment earnings improved by $495 million primarily due to the absence of losses related to Connexion by Boeing, which included a charge of $320 million to exit this business in 2006. Lower unallocated expense in 2007 contributed $548 million to the 2007 earnings improvement. Operating earnings increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily driven by improved earnings at Commercial Airplanes resulting from higher revenue from new aircraft deliveries, increased earnings from commercial aviation support business and improved cost performance. Lower unallocated expense in 2006 also contributed to the 2006 earnings increase. This was partially offset by a $571 million charge for 20 Table of Contents global settlement with U.S. DoJ, lower IDS earnings reflecting a $569 million net gain on the sale of our Rocketdyne business in 2005 and $770 million of charges on the AEW&C development program in 2006 partially offset by improved margins on other programs and a $320 million charge related to the exit of the Connexion by Boeing business recorded in Other segment. The most significant items included in Unallocated expense are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Pension and other postretirement $ (686 ) $ (472 ) $ (851 ) Share based plans (233 ) (680 ) (999 ) Deferred compensation (51 ) (211 ) (186 ) Other (215 ) (370 ) (371 ) Unallocated expense $ (1,185 ) $ (1,733 ) $ (2,407 ) We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,773 million, $1,663 million and $1,852 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, earnings from operations included $1,730 million, $1,227 million and $1,893 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under GAAP in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. Pension and other postretirement expense increased during 2007 when compared with 2006 primarily due to increased overall pension costs recognized in inventory as of December 31, 2006, which are subsequently expensed in cost of sales in 2007. Pension and other postretirement expense decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 mainly due to an absence of net settlement and curtailment charges partially offset by an increase in the amount of actuarial loss that was amortized. The reduction in Share based plans expense is primarily due to lower Performance Shares outstanding during 2007 and higher expense acceleration during 2006, resulting from 12 payouts compared with six payouts in 2007. The decrease in 2006 Share based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price during 2005 which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price. Other expense decreased in 2007 partly due to reduced intercompany profit elimination as a result of fewer intercompany deliveries during 2007 compared with 2006. 21 Table of Contents Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Earnings from operations $ 5,830 $ 3,014 $ 2,812 Other income, net 484 420 301 Interest and debt expense (196 ) (240 ) (294 ) Earnings before income taxes 6,118 3,194 2,819 Income tax expense (2,060 ) (988 ) (257 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 4,058 $ 2,206 $ 2,562 Other income, which primarily consists of interest income, was higher in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of increases in average principal balances and higher average rates of return on cash and investments. Other income was higher in 2006 compared with 2005 as a result of increases in average principal balances and higher average rates of return, partially offset by lower interest income compared with 2005 related to federal income tax settlements for prior years. Interest and debt expense decreased in 2007 and in 2006, primarily due to debt repayments. The effective income tax rate of 33.7% for 2007 differed from the 2006 effective income tax rate of 30.9% primarily due to Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income exclusion tax benefits that existed in 2006, but did not recur in 2007. This was partially offset by the non deduction in 2006 of the global settlement with the U.S. DoJ and other income tax provision adjustments. The 2007 tax rate of 33.7% included enhanced Research and Development credits that exceeded the credits in 2006. The effective income tax rate of 30.9% for 2006 differed from the 2005 effective income tax rate of 9.1% primarily due to the favorable 2005 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the non deduction in 2006 of the global settlement with the U.S. DoJ. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes see Note 4. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non U.S. government contract funding. Contractual backlog increased by $80,397 million in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of increases at Commercial Airplanes of $80,900 million, which were due to new orders in excess of deliveries for all programs offset by decreases at IDS of $503 million. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Funding that is subsequently received is moved to contractual backlog. The decrease in IDS unobligated backlog of $3,502 million during 2007 compared with 2006 is primarily due to funding released from existing contracts on Future Combat Systems (FCS), Proprietary, C 17, P8 A and F 18, partially offset by increases in the F 22 program and Support Systems. 22 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment The fundamental drivers of air travel growth are a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Air traffic growth continues to exceed its long term trend due to strong performance of these key drivers. Global economic growth, the primary driver of air traffic growth, remained above long term trend for the fourth straight year in 2007. The world economy has grown at an average 3.8% annual rate since 2004 compared to the long term trend rate of 3.1%. The increasingly diversified world economy is forecast to continue above trend growth through the end of the decade although there is increased uncertainty in the near term outlook due to a slowdown in the United States economy. Increasingly liberalized and competitive air travel markets are also supporting strong traffic growth. Many bilateral air service agreements governing air traffic rights between countries are liberalizing air travel around the world particularly in high growth markets such as China and India which have signed multiple new agreements over the last several years. In addition, open skies agreements, in which all traffic rights restrictions are eliminated, continue to emerge with United States European Union open skies negotiations being the most prominent recent example. Airline ownership is also becoming more commercially driven governments are reducing ownership and control stakes, moving away from national carriers. All of these facets of liberalization are increasing competition between airlines and further stimulating demand for air travel. In this increasingly liberalized environment, airlines are offering improved service levels increasing flight frequency and airport pairs served by 5% per year since 2004. The combination of these two fundamental drivers has led to a 9% annual average increase in the number of passengers since 2003. In addition, high fuel prices are spurring strong demand to replace older, less fuel efficient airplanes. Together, these two factors have led to strong demand for new aircraft over 7,000 orders for large commercial jet aircraft over the last four years, increasing industry backlog levels to seven years of deliveries at current production rates. Fuel prices are also playing a key role in increasing the current demand for new aircraft. Strong economic growth has also led to sustained high oil and fuel prices. Between 2003 and 2007, jet fuel expense grew from 15 percent to more than 30 percent of airline operating costs. Airlines are responding by improving the fuel efficiency of their aircraft operations and reducing cost in many other areas. They are implementing more efficient (internet based) distribution systems, reducing commission payments, and drawing on their employees for participation in labor cost reduction. These initiatives, combined with strong demand, are enabling industry wide profitability despite high fuel prices. Worldwide airlines achieved a $5.6 billion net profit in 2007 and are forecast to earn $5.0 billion in 2008. Looking forward, our 20 year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger traffic, and 6% per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $2.8 trillion market for 28,600 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian flu), terrorism, global economic cycles, increased global environmental regulations and fuel prices. Fuel prices are forecast to remain elevated and volatile in the near term due to strong demand driven by economic growth and historically low surplus capacity to cushion against supply shocks. 23 Table of Contents Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns. Approximately two thirds of Commercial Airplanes sales and contractual backlog are directly from customers based outside the United States. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100 seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China, and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 130 seat aircraft market over the next few years. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in 2007 puts pressure on competitors revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer term competitive posture. Airbus has recently announced such initiatives targeting a two year reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity by 2010. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, Airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 33,386 $ 28,465 $ 21,365 % of Total company revenues 50 % 46 % 40 % Earnings from operations $ 3,584 $ 2,733 $ 1,431 Operating margins 10.7 % 9.6 % 6.7 % Research and development $ 2,962 $ 2,390 $ 1,302 Contractual backlog $ 255,176 $ 174,276 $ 124,132 Revenues The increase in revenue of $4,921 million in 2007 from 2006 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $3,369 million, increased commercial aviation support business of $1,432 million and $120 million primarily attributable to revenue from aircraft trading. 24 Table of Contents The increase in revenue of $7,100 million in 2006 from 2005 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $6,820 million, increased commercial aviation support business of $873 million offset by $593 million primarily attributable to lower revenue from aircraft trading. In 2005 we delivered 29 fewer than expected airplanes due to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) strike during the month of September 2005. This resulted in approximately $2,000 million lower revenue than anticipated for 2005. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: 717 737 NG 747 757 767 777 Total 2007 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,466 1,396 1,049 959 687 Deliveries 330 * 16 12 * 83 441 2006 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,136 1,380 1,049 947 604 Deliveries 5 (3) 302 * 14 12 * 65 398 2005 Cumulative Deliveries 150 1,834 1,366 1,049 935 539 Deliveries 13 (5) 212 * 13 2 10 * 40 290 * Intracompany deliveries were one 767 aircraft and one 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2007, two 767 aircraft and eight 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2006 and two 767 aircraft and two 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2005. Earnings from Operations The $851 million increase in earnings from operations in 2007 over the comparable period of 2006 was primarily attributable to earnings of $950 million on increased new aircraft deliveries and $304 million in increased earnings primarily attributable to commercial aviation support business. In addition cost performance improved by $169 million. These were offset by an increase in research and development costs of $572 million. The $1,302 million increase in earnings from operations in 2006 over the comparable period of 2005 was primarily attributable to earnings of $1,781 million on increased new aircraft deliveries and $315 million in increased earnings primarily attributable to commercial aviation support business. In addition cost performance improved by $226 million. Such items were offset by increased research and development costs of $1,088 million. In 2005 we had a loss on the sale of Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma operations of $68 million. The IAM strike resulted in lower operating earnings in 2005 due to 29 fewer than expected airplane deliveries. Backlog The backlog increase in 2007 related to orders in excess of deliveries for all programs, while the increase in 2006 related to orders in excess of deliveries for 737NG, 747 and 787. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. Its determination is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts. It is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. 25 Table of Contents Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: Program 717 737 NG 747 757 767 777 787 2007 Program accounting quantities 156 3,800 1,474 1,050 998 950 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 2,076 125 52 357 817 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 155 4,542 1,521 1,049 1,011 1,044 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A 2006 Program accounting quantities 156 3,200 1,449 1,050 985 900 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 1,560 116 28 299 448 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 155 3,696 1,496 1,049 975 903 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 8 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 1 % N/A 2005 Program accounting quantities 156 2,800 1,424 1,050 971 800 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 5 1,123 58 30 288 287 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 155 2,957 1,424 1,049 965 827 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 3 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 0 % N/A * The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2009. 1 Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its Board of Directors, shareholders, government and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights. 2 Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 737 Next Generation The accounting quantity for the 737 Next Generation program increased by 600 units during 2007 due to the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units during 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2007 we completed firm configuration of the 747 8 Intercontinental airplane and during 2006 we completed firm configuration of the 747 8 Freighter. While there are always risks to development, production and certification schedules in the introduction of a new commercial derivative airplane, deliveries of the first 747 8 Freighter and Intercontinental airplane are targeted for late 2009 and late 2010. 26 Table of Contents 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 13 units during 2007. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2007 as a result of the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. Firm configuration of the 777 Freighter was completed during 2006. Deliveries of the first 777 Freighter are targeted for late 2008. 787 Program We are in the very critical stages of final assembly and planning for flight test, and the risks that are always inherent in these latter stages of airplane production still remain. We continue to address challenges associated with assembly of the first airplanes, including start up issues in our factory, management of our extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work and reconciliation of the airplanes configuration with supplier and partner engineering. In January 2008 we announced that first flight of the 787 has been moved from the end of the first quarter of 2008 to around the end of the second quarter of 2008 to provide additional time to complete assembly of the first airplane. Deliveries are now expected to begin in early 2009, rather than late 2008. We continue working with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of the schedule change on the flight test program and entry into service. Fleet support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as commercial aviation support, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense increased $572 million and $1,088 million in 2007 and 2006. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The increase in 2007 was due to higher spending of $542 million, primarily on 787 and 747 8, and $30 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. We anticipate a decrease in research and development spending for 2008 primarily due to reduced 787 product development activities. 27 Table of Contents Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS consists of three capabilities driven businesses: Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems (PE&MS), Network and Space Systems (N&SS), and Support Systems. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. is faced with continuous force deployments overseas, stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and uncertainties about near peer adversary states with growing sophistication and military means. At the same time, our defense department faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the latest Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant Federal budget deficits and bipartisan objectives to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending as well as the upcoming 2008 Presidential elections. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade. Because U.S. DoD spending was about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately 84% of IDS revenue in 2007, the trends and drivers associated with the U.S. DoD budget are critical. The U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, particularly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although the growth rate had moderated in recent years, the 2009 submittal equates to a 7.5% increase over 2008. The Presidents request for fiscal year 2009 is $515 billion, excluding the additional initial request of $70 billion to continue the fight in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The Procurement account continues to see growth with a request of $104 billion, a 5% increase over 2008, while the Research, Development, Test & Evaluation account increased modestly to $80 billion, a 4% increase from the 2008 level. (All projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account and without accounting for Supplemental funding.) Over the past years, emergency supplemental requests have been used to cover the on going costs of the GWOT. In addition to the fiscal year 2008 discretionary budget request, the President also submitted supplemental requests totaling $189 billion to cover operations in the GWOT. It is anticipated that additional supplemental requests for 2009 will exceed $100 billion, including the $70 billion initially requested, and that the trend to use supplemental requests to fund the GWOT will continue. Even though we continue to see modest growth in the U.S. DoD budget, it is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the latest QDR. This imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness and network enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, long range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons as well as continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Consolidation of contractor provided U.S. government launch capabilities was completed with the formation of the ULA joint venture in 2006. This consolidation was driven by the limited schedule of government launches as well as the downturn in the commercial launch market. Launch contractors had built business cases around the government market being supplemented by a robust commercial market, but as the commercial market declined these business cases were re evaluated. The U.S. government has an assured access to space policy which requires that two separate vehicles be available for use. The ULA joint venture is intended to provide this assurance. 28 Table of Contents Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment NASA has had stable but very little growth in their funding in this decade. NASAs fiscal year 2007 appropriation of $16.6 billion was approximately equal to the fiscal year 2006 funding level. NASAs budget remains focused on needed funds for Space Shuttle Operations, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. We anticipate funding levels to remain in the $17 $18 billion range in the near future. NASA is continuing to pursue elements of the Vision for Space Exploration, which will provide additional opportunities. Commercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade. The market remains extremely competitive with overcapacity across the overall industry and strong pressure on pricing. We will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions. Integrated Defense Systems Operating Results IDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2007, the B 1 bomber program (formerly included in PE&MS) and certain Boeing Australia Limited programs (formerly included in N&SS) are included in Support Systems. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 22. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 32,080 $ 32,439 $ 31,106 % of Total company revenues 48 % 53 % 58 % Earnings from operations $ 3,440 $ 3,032 $ 3,919 Operating margins 10.7 % 9.3 % 12.6 % Research and development $ 851 $ 791 $ 855 Contractual backlog $ 41,788 $ 42,291 $ 36,505 Unobligated backlog $ 29,922 $ 33,424 $ 44,008 Since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts, or as one large multi year order or long term award. As a result, period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues IDS revenues decreased 1% in 2007 primarily due the exclusion of the government Delta volume from N&SS revenues, now a revenue component for our joint venture ULA. Decreased revenue from this exclusion and lower revenues in the PE&MS segment were partially offset by increased volume in other N&SS programs and growth in the Support Systems segment. IDS revenues increased 4% in 2006 as growth in PE&MS and Support Systems was partially offset by lower volume in N&SS. Operating Earnings IDS operating earnings increased by $408 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to $770 million of charges on the AEW&C development program in 2006. The 2007 increase was partially offset by lower earnings in the PE&MS and N&SS segments. Operating earnings 29 Table of Contents decreased by $887 million in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting a $569 million net gain on the sale of Rocketdyne in 2005 and $770 million of charges on the AEW&C development program in 2006 partially offset by improved margins on other programs. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. IDS total backlog decreased 5% in 2007, from $75,715 million to $71,710 million, primarily due to current year deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in FCS, C 17, and P 8A programs. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Airborne Laser, E/A 18G, Family of Beyond Line of Sight Terminals (JTRS), FCS, Ground based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Joint Tactical Radio System, P 8A and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed, which could trigger termination for default provisions, the loss of satellite in orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEW&C, international KC 767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, SBInet, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation. Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 13,685 $ 14,107 $ 13,308 % of Total company revenues 21 % 23 % 25 % Earnings from operations $ 1,629 $ 1,208 $ 1,720 Operating margins 11.9 % 8.6 % 12.9 % Research and development $ 447 $ 392 $ 432 Contractual backlog $ 22,957 $ 24,739 $ 21,630 Unobligated backlog $ 8,564 $ 8,962 $ 15,054 Revenues PE&MS revenues decreased 3% in 2007 compared with an increase of 6% in 2006. The decrease of $422 million in 2007 was due to reduced deliveries of the Apache and T 45 aircraft and Joint Direct Attack Munitions, partially offset by higher deliveries of Chinook and F 18 aircraft and higher volume on the P 8A program. The revenue growth of $799 million in 2006 was driven by higher deliveries of F 15 and Apache aircraft and higher volume on P 8A, F 22, and Chinook, partially offset by reduced revenues on AEW&C. 30 Table of Contents Deliveries of new build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 F/A 18 Models 44 42 42 T 45TS Goshawk 9 13 10 F 15E Eagle 12 12 6 C 17 Globemaster 16 16 16 CH 47 Chinook 10 2 AH 64 Apache 17 31 12 C 40A Clipper 3 1 2 Total New Build Production Aircraft 111 117 88 Operating Earnings PE&MS operating earnings increased by $421 million in 2007 primarily due to the 2006 charges of $770 million on the AEW&C development program, which were partially offset by lower 2007 earnings due to revised cost estimates on the international KC 767 Tanker program, lower prices on the C 17 program and revised cost and revenue estimates on the AEW&C program. Operating earnings decreased by $512 million in 2006 due to the above mentioned AEW&C charge, which was partially offset by earnings from revenue growth, favorable contract mix, and reduced Company Sponsored Research & Development expenditures on the 767 Tanker program. Research and Development The PE&MS segment continues to focus its research and development resources where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large scale integration capabilities to provide innovative solutions to meet the war fighters enduring needs. Research and development has remained consistent over the past several years. Research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures, system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers capabilities in the areas of mobility, precision effects, situational awareness and survivability. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability, and improving affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Continued research and development investments in unmanned technology and systems have enabled the demonstration of multi vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high performance unmanned combat air vehicles. Research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes, among other things, precision guidance and multi mode targeting. Research and development investments in the Global Tanker Aircraft program represent a significant opportunity to provide state of the art refueling capabilities to domestic and non U.S. customers. Investments were also made to support various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance business opportunities including P 8A and AEW&C aircraft. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the F/A 18E/F Super Hornet, F 15E Eagle, AH 64 Apache, CH 47 Chinook and C 17 Globemaster. Backlog PE&MS total backlog decreased by 6% in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to deliveries and sales on C 17, F/A 18, P 8A and F 15. These decreases were partially offset by a multi year contract for F 22 aircraft and international orders for AEW&C and F/A 18 aircraft. Total backlog decreased by 8% in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to deliveries and sales on F/A 18 and F 15 from multi year contracts awarded in prior years. 31 Table of Contents Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on PE&MS operations include the following: AEW&C During 2006 we recorded charges of $770 million on our international Airborne Early Warning & Control program. This development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia and Peace Eagle in Turkey, consists of a 737 700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle includes four aircraft. This is an advanced and complex fixed price development program involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed. International KC 767 Tanker Program During 2007, the PE&MS segment recorded charges of $152 million which were partially offset at the consolidated level. Currently the international KC 767 Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. These charges are associated with additional estimated costs for mitigating both the risks on the flight test program and the delivery risk associated with the Italy and Japan contracts. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed. C 17 As of December 31, 2007 we delivered 171 of the 190 C 17 aircraft ordered by the U.S. Air Force, with final deliveries scheduled for 2009. In June 2007, based upon continued bipartisan congressional support, including the House Armed Services Committee addition of $2.4 billion for 10 C 17s in their mark of the 2008 budget, and U.S. Air Force testimony to Congress reflecting interest in additional C 17 aircraft, we directed key suppliers to begin work on 10 aircraft beyond the 190 currently on order. As of December 31, 2007, inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers for work performed related to anticipated orders for 10 C 17 aircraft to the U.S. Air Force and anticipated international orders for 3 additional aircraft totaled approximately $215 million. It is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2008 to complete production of the C 17 if further orders are not received. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut down, including any recovery that would be available from the government. Such recovery from the government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from the second quarter direction to key suppliers to begin working on the additional 10 aircraft. Network and Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 11,696 $ 11,941 $ 12,221 % of Total company revenues 18 % 19 % 23 % Earnings from operations $ 891 $ 952 $ 1,395 Operating margins 7.6 % 8.0 % 11.4 % Research and development $ 300 $ 301 $ 334 Contractual backlog $ 9,167 $ 7,838 $ 6,324 Unobligated backlog $ 20,210 $ 23,723 $ 27,634 32 Table of Contents Revenues N&SS revenues decreased 2% in both 2007 and 2006. The decrease of $245 million in 2007 was primarily due to the exclusion of government Delta volume, now a component of our equity investment in ULA and lower FCS volume, partially offset by increased volume on SBInet and several satellite programs. The decrease of $280 million in 2006 was primarily due to lower volume in Proprietary and GMD as well as the divestiture of our Rocketdyne business, which were partly offset by significant growth in FCS and higher Delta IV volume. Additional impacts resulted from fewer milestone completions in our commercial satellite business in 2006 and the completion of a Homeland Security contract in 2005. Delta launch and new build satellite deliveries were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Delta II Commercial 3 Delta II Government 2 2 Delta IV Government 3 Satellites 4 4 3 Delta government launches are excluded from our deliveries after December 1, 2006 due to the formation of ULA. Operating Earnings N&SS operating earnings decreased by $61 million in 2007 and decreased by $443 million in 2006. The decrease in 2007 was due to lower earnings on FCS and several satellite programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher award fees on GMD and a $44 million gain on sale of Anaheim property. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to the $569 million net gain on the Rocketdyne sale and higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005, partially offset by increased earnings in the FCS program in 2006. N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $85 million, $71 million and $72 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively and equity loss of $11 million and equity earnings of $5 million from the ULA joint venture in 2007 and 2006. The ULA equity earnings and loss amounts are net of the basis difference amortization. Divestitures On February 28, 2005, we completed the stock sale of Electronic Dynamic Devices Inc. to L 3 Communications. On August 2, 2005 we completed the sale of our Rocketdyne business to United Technologies Corporation. See Note 7 Exit Activity and Divestitures. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of intelligence and surveillance systems; communications and command and control capabilities that support a network enabled architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include Joint Tactical Radio System, FCS, Global Positioning System, and Transformational Satellite Communications System. Investments were also made to support concepts that will lead to the development of next generation space intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network enabled capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. Backlog N&SS total backlog decreased by 7% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to revenues recognized on multi year orders received in prior years on FCS and Proprietary programs, partially offset by an increase in our Space Exploration programs. Total backlog decreased by 7% in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi year orders received in prior years on the FCS program. 33 Table of Contents Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on N&SS operations include the following: United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we completed the transaction with Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) to create a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. (ULA). ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. In connection with the transaction, we initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. On July 24, 2007 we and Lockheed reached agreement with respect to resolution of the final working capital and the value of the launch vehicle support contracts that each party contributed to form ULA. Effective August 15, 2007 the parties received all necessary approvals pursuant to the terms of the Consent Order and the terms of the agreement which resulted in additional contributions from both parties with Boeing agreeing to contribute an additional $97 million which did not result in a cash outflow as it will be offset against future payments due to us from ULA associated with an inventory supply agreement. Additionally, conformed accounting adjustments made by ULA resulted in adjustments to ULAs balance sheet. The book value of our investment exceeds our proportionate share of ULAs net assets. This difference will be expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $14 million annually for the next 17 years. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each committed to provide up to $25 million in additional capital contributions and we each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. In December 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non recoverability of $1,375 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to the inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA sold $443 million of inventories that were contributed by us. During 2007, ULA determined that certain Delta II inventory is not fully recoverable. As a result we recorded charges of $31 million for non recoverable Delta II inventory and $39 million for our share of the loss recorded by ULA related to Delta II. Future decisions regarding the Delta II program could reduce our earnings by up to $100 million. We also agreed to indemnify ULA in the event ULA is unable to obtain re pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ULA and to which we believe ULA is entitled. We will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to $332 million in pre tax losses related to these contracts. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers. 34 Table of Contents We have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we believe we can recover a portion of the cost (estimated at $486 million) through guarantees from the other venture partners. The components of this exposure are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) EstimatedMaximumExposure EstablishedReserves EstimatedProceedsfromRecourse EstimatedNetExposure Credit guarantees $ 457 $ 183 $ 274 Partner Loans (principal and interest) 479 287 192 Trade receivable from Sea Launch 337 334 3 Performance guarantees 33 20 13 Subcontract termination 8 8 Other receivables and Inventory 47 39 8 $ 1,361 $ 843 $ 486 $ 32 We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2007. The venture conducted zero, five and four successful launches for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. A Sea Launch Zenit 3SL vehicle, carrying a Boeing built NSS 8 satellite, experienced an anomaly during launch on January 30, 2007. The launch platform has been repaired and resumed flight operations on January 15, 2008, successfully launching a Boeing built satellite. The venture incurred losses in 2007 due to a delay in its 2007 launch manifest that was caused by the launch anomaly and unusually strong ocean currents at the launch site during November and December. The venture incurred losses in 2006 and 2005 due to the relatively low price and volume of launches, driven by a depressed commercial satellite market and oversupply of launch vehicles as well as a high level of debt and debt servicing requirements. We suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to Sea Launch down to zero in 2001 and accruing our obligation for third party guarantees on Sea Launch indebtedness. We are not obligated to provide any further financial support to the Sea Launch venture. However, in the event that we do extend additional financial support to Sea Launch in the future, we will recognize suspended losses as appropriate. In addition, we continue to look at alternative capital structures for the venture. Satellites The Boeing built NSS 8 satellite was declared a total loss due to an anomaly during launch on January 30, 2007. The NSS 8 satellite was insured for $200 million which was collected during the second and third quarter of 2007. New Skies Satellites B.V. (New Skies) declined to exercise its option to purchase a replacement spacecraft due to its assertion that we anticipatorily breached the contract. We believe that had New Skies exercised its option, we would have fulfilled our contractual responsibilities. We do not expect New Skies assertion to materially impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) litigation/arbitration with ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd., Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications, Telesat Canada, and Space Communications Corporation in Note 21. 35 Table of Contents Support Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 6,699 $ 6,391 $ 5,577 % of Total company revenues 10 % 10 % 10 % Earnings from operations $ 920 $ 872 $ 804 Operating margins 13.7 % 13.6 % 14.4 % Research and development $ 104 $ 98 $ 89 Contractual backlog $ 9,664 $ 9,714 $ 8,551 Unobligated backlog $ 1,148 $ 739 $ 1,320 Revenues Support Systems revenues increased $308 million in 2007 and $814 million in 2006, an increase of 5% and 15%. The increases were due to higher Integrated Logistics (IL) program volume resulting from the 2006 acquisition of Aviall, Inc. (Aviall) and increased revenue on the C 17 support program. Higher international program volume in 2007 was the result of our increased ownership in Alsalam Aircraft Company (Alsalam) which occurred during the second quarter of 2006. Lower volume on several Maintenance, Modification and Upgrades (MM&U) and Training Systems and Services (TS&S) programs partially offset the 2007 increases. Higher volume on several MM&U programs also contributed to the significant growth in 2006 revenues. In the second quarter of 2006 we increased our ownership interest in Alsalam, which operates as a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul facility for various military and commercial aircraft. As a result, we began consolidating Alsalams financial statements, which generated revenues of $207 million during 2007 and $137 million during the last three quarters of 2006. Operating Earnings Support Systems operating earnings increased by 5% in 2007 and increased by 9% in 2006 driven by the revenue increases mentioned above in addition to a different contract mix. Research and Development Support Systems continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, MM&U, TS&S and Advanced Logistics Support Systems, as well as on moving into the innovative Network Centric Logistics areas. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative and disciplined tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C 17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A 18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, and the F 15 Singapore Performance Based Logistics contract. Backlog Support Systems total backlog increased by 3% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to increases in TS&S programs and International Support programs which were partially offset by decreases in MM&U and IL programs. Total backlog increased by 6% in 2006 compared with 2005 driven by a large IL order for Chinook support. Boeing Capital Corporation Segment Business Environment and Trends BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2007 totaled $6,532 million, which was substantially collateralized by Boeing produced commercial aircraft. While worldwide traffic levels are well above those in the past, the effects of higher fuel prices continue to impact the airline industry. At the same time, the credit ratings of some airlines, particularly in the United States, have remained at low levels. A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airline customers. 36 Table of Contents Certain aircraft models in BCCs portfolio have recently experienced a lower rate of decline in market value and some models have experienced increases in market value. This market value condition had been due to certain positive factors including passenger load at record high levels, a limited supply of economically viable used aircraft, increasing lease rates, and increased demand from used aircraft buyers. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,600 commercial jet aircraft (8.2% of current world fleet) continue to be parked, including both in production and out of production aircraft types, of which over 60% are not expected to return to service. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 815 $ 1,025 $ 966 Earnings from operations $ 234 $ 291 $ 232 Operating margins 29 % 28 % 24 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCCs revenues decreased $210 million in 2007, resulting from lower interest income on notes receivable of $75 million, lower investment income of $50 million primarily due to the sale or repayment at maturity of certain investments in 2006 and lower net gain on disposal of assets of $47 million. BCCs revenues increased $59 million in 2006, primarily due to an increase of investment income and higher gain on the sale of aircraft and certain investments in notes receivable. Operating earnings BCCs operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $57 million in 2007 primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by lower interest expense, lower asset impairment expense and lower depreciation expense and a recovery of losses. The increase in operating earnings in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher revenues. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC: (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 6,532 $ 8,034 Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables 2.5 % 2.4 % Debt $ 4,327 $ 5,590 Debt to Equity Ratio 5.0 to 1 5.0 to 1 BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2007 decreased from December 31, 2006 due to prepayment of certain notes receivable, normal portfolio run off and sale of certain portfolio assets. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, BCC had $86 million and $259 million of 37 Table of Contents assets that were held for sale or re lease of which $86 million and $253 million had firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $292 million are scheduled to be returned off lease in the next 12 months. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and $132 million were committed at December 31, 2007. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. Finance Restructurings From time to time, certain BCC customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2007, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and or financial position. Other Segment Other segment operating losses were $243 million during 2007 as compared to losses of $738 million in 2006. The reduction of $495 million was primarily due to the absence of losses related to Connexion by Boeing, which we exited in 2006. As part of our exit from this business, we recognized a charge of $320 million in 2006, in addition to losses of $237 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We have not reached final settlements with all customers or suppliers. We do not believe the final settlements will have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and or financial position. Other segment operating losses were $738 million during 2006 as compared to losses of $363 million in 2005. The increase of $375 million was primarily due to the $320 million charge from the exit of the Connexion by Boeing business and the $68 million environmental expense recognized in 2006. The Other segment recorded $74 million of lower valuation allowances for customer financing in 2006 compared to 2005. Additionally, during 2005, the Other segment recognized earnings of $63 million associated with the buyout of several operating lease aircraft by a customer. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net earnings $ 4,074 $ 2,215 $ 2,572 Non cash items 2,835 3,097 3,494 Changes in working capital 2,675 2,187 934 Net cash provided by operating activities 9,584 7,499 7,000 Net cash used by investing activities (3,822 ) (3,186 ) (98 ) Net cash used by financing activities (4,884 ) (3,645 ) (4,657 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 46 38 (37 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 924 706 2,208 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 6,118 5,412 3,204 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 7,042 $ 6,118 $ 5,412 Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2,085 million to $9,584 million in 2007, primarily due to an increase in Net earnings. In addition, working capital improved in 2007, reflecting higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders and decreases in customer financing assets due to pre payment of certain notes receivable and normal portfolio run off, which were partially offset by an increase in inventories driven by the continued ramp up of the 787 program. 38 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $499 million to $7,499 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to working capital improvements which were partially offset by lower Net earnings. The working capital improvements in 2006 compared with 2005 reflect $1,340 million of lower pension contributions in 2006. Working capital reductions in 2006 also reflect higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders, decreased investment in customer financing, and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liability. Investing activities Cash used for investing activities increased to $3,822 million in 2007 from $3,186 million in 2006, largely due to increases in short term investments, primarily time deposits and commercial paper, partially offset by our investment in the acquisition of Aviall in 2006. At December 31, 2007 the recorded balances of time deposits and commercial paper classified as short term investments were $1,025 million and $799 million. As of December 31, 2007, our externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments had an average duration of 1.5 years. The balance, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $3,269 million and $3,180 million, of which $306 million and $257 million was classified as short term. The investments are held as available for sale. Cash used for investing activities increased to $3,186 million in 2006 from $98 million in 2005. The increase is primarily due to our investment of $1,738 million in the 2006 acquisition of Aviall, net of $42 million of cash acquired, and $458 million of assumed debt, in an all cash merger. The assumed debt was repaid on the acquisition closing date. In 2005, we received proceeds of $1,676 million, primarily from the disposition of our Commercial Airplanes operations in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, and the sale of Rocketdyne. Financing activities Cash used by financing activities increased to $4,884 million in 2007 from $3,645 million in 2006 primarily due to increased common share repurchases. Cash used by financing activities decreased to $3,645 million in 2006 from $4,657 million in 2005 primarily due to lower common share repurchases. During 2007, we repurchased 28,995,599 shares at an average price of $95.68 in our open market share repurchase program and 28,432 shares in stock swaps. During 2006, we repurchased 21,184,202 shares at an average price of $80.18 in our open market share repurchase program, 3,749,377 shares at an average price of $80.28 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 49,288 shares in stock swaps. During 2005, we repurchased 45,217,300 shares at an average price of $63.60 in our open market share repurchase program and 33,660 shares in stock swaps. In 2007, we repaid $1,406 million of debt, including $1,309 million of debt held at BCC. In 2006, we repaid $1,681 million of debt, including $713 million of debt held at BCC and $458 million of debt assumed in the Aviall acquisition. In 2005, we repaid $1,378 million of debt. There were no debt issuances during 2007, 2006, or 2005. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the recorded balance of debt was $8,217 million and $9,538 million, of which $4,327 million and $5,590 million was recorded at BCC. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moodys Standard &Poors Long term: Boeing/BCC A+ A2 A+ Short term: Boeing/BCC F1 P 1 A 1 39 Table of Contents On September 12, 2007, Fitch Ratings revised its ratings outlook to positive from stable, citing continuation of strong orders and production ramp up of large commercial aircraft, in addition to an over funded status of our pension plans, debt reduction and stronger than expected cash flows. The ratings were reaffirmed at A+ for long term borrowings and F1 for short term borrowings. On January 16, 2008, Fitch Ratings changed their outlook on the A+ rating to stable from positive, citing the impact of delays in the 787 program. Capital Resources We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity. Throughout 2007 and at December 31, 2007, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We believe we have substantial borrowing capacity. Currently, we have $3,000 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. In 2007, we renewed the 364 day revolving credit facility and the 5 year credit facility, of which $500 million and $1,000 million is allocated to BCC. BCC has an aggregate of $3,421 million available for issuance from shelf registrations filed with the SEC, which are due to expire in November 2008. We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. We and Lockheed have agreed to make available to ULA a line of credit in the amount of up to $200 million each as may be necessary from time to time to support ULAs Expendable Launch Vehicle business during the five year period following December 1, 2006. ULA did not request any funds under the line of credit as of December 31, 2007. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158), we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, with a corresponding after tax adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The 2007 annual remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement plans resulted in a net $3,441 million increase in Shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. 40 Table of Contents Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2007, and the estimated timing thereof. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 13years 35years After 5years Long term debt (including current portion) $ 8,114 $ 746 $ 1,197 $ 2,090 $ 4,081 Interest on debt* 5,607 507 910 684 3,506 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 7,403 675 1,441 1,549 3,738 Capital lease obligations 103 19 22 22 40 Operating lease obligations 1,086 221 297 158 410 Purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position 104,023 37,922 40,785 18,281 7,035 Purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position 10,827 9,829 598 396 4 Total contractual obligations $ 137,163 $ 49,919 $ 45,250 $ 23,180 $ 18,814 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2007. Variable rate debt was approximately 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2007. Income tax obligations As of December 31, 2007, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,374 million, of which $253 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $1,121 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 4. Pension and other postretirement benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to a single plan that is funded through a trust. Purchase obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 11% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts. Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement 41 Table of Contents through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial participation agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2007, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2007, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $8.9 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a country outside the U.S. or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Commercial commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2007. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 4,973 $ 4,585 $ 238 $ 1 $ 149 Aircraft financing commercial commitments 8,350 879 2,764 3,443 1,264 Total commercial commitments $ 13,323 $ 5,464 $ 3,002 $ 3,444 $ 1,413 Aircraft financing commercial commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers, see Note 13. Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita, Kansas and Fulton County, Georgia to finance the purchase and or construction of real and personal property, see Note 12. 42 Table of Contents Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21, including our contesting the default termination of the A 12 aircraft, employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees, and litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $679 million at December 31, 2007. For additional information, see Note 13. Income Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,272 million at December 31, 2007 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 4. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contracts sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future 43 Table of Contents periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2007 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1.0%, it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately $321 million. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2007 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately $278 million. Aircraft Valuation Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re lease We evaluate assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re lease for impairment when the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset is less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intentions for how long we will 44 Table of Contents hold an asset subject to operating lease before we sell the asset, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventory at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing, however, the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Two of the major factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings and collateral values. If each customers credit rating were increased or decreased by one major rating category at December 31, 2007, the allowance would have decreased by $22 million or increased by $49 million. If the collateral values were 10% lower at December 31, 2007, the allowance would have increased by $27 million. Lease residual values Equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases. If the estimated residual values declined 5% at December 31, 2007, this would result in a future cumulative pre tax earnings impact of $105 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which $10 million would be recognized in 2008. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. 45 Table of Contents The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of our previous impairment test, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements. Indefinite lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would result in an impairment charge of approximately $11 million. Postretirement plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all our employees. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the expected long term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense. In addition, as result of our adoption of SFAS 158, differences between actual and expected returns on assets, changes in assumptions, and changes in plan provisions could significantly increase or decrease Shareholders Equity (net of taxes) at future measurement dates. We use a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of our September 30 annual measurement date. Changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to Shareholders Equity as of the measurement date. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2007 (in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Dollars Dollars Projected benefit obligation (pensions) (1,263 ) 1,436 Net periodic pension cost (145 ) 155 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (168 ) 185 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (14 ) 13 Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2007 pension income by approximately $114 million. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return are reflected in Shareholders Equity (net of taxes) as of our annual measurement date. 46 Table of Contents The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following years expense recorded liabilities and Shareholders Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change. As of September 30, 2007 (in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 621 (545 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 121 (109 ) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally investments, fixed rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. The principal source of BCCs market risk relates to interest rate changes. This risk is managed by matching the profile of BCCs liabilities with the profile of BCCs assets. Exposure to mismatched risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives. We do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Although many of the assets, liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded, if we had an immediate, one time, 100 basis point increase in market rates at December 31, 2007, we estimate that the tax adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by $12 million compared to a decrease of $9 million at December 31, 2006. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing existing debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2007, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by $69 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 47 Table of Contents
