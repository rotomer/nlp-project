Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second largest defense contractor in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world. Our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses Commercial Airplanes and Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications and space to deliver capability driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others cyclicality. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Commercial Airplanes $ 28,263 $ 33,386 $ 28,465 Integrated Defense Systems 32,047 32,052 32,411 Boeing Capital Corporation 703 815 1,025 Other 567 308 327 Unallocated items and eliminations (671 ) (174 ) (698 ) Revenues $ 60,909 $ 66,387 $ 61,530 The decrease in 2008 revenues of $5,478 million is primarily due to lower revenues at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $5,123 million, primarily as a result of decreases in new airplane deliveries reflecting the effects of the labor strike, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues and higher pre strike deliveries and model mix. We delivered 104 fewer than expected airplanes due to the IAM strike during 2008. This reduced revenue by approximately $6.4 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. IDS revenues were unchanged as revenue growth in Global Services and Support (GS&S) was offset by decreases in Boeing Military Airplanes (BMA) and Network and Space Systems (N&SS). BCC revenues decreased by $112 million primarily due to lower interest income on financing receivables and notes and a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues increased by $259 million primarily due to the sale of four C 17 aircraft during 2008, that were held under an operating lease. Unallocated items and eliminations changed by $497 million, primarily due to the intercompany elimination of P 8A Poseidon program (P 8A) revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes. 20 Table of Contents Revenues in 2007 grew by $4,857 million, primarily due to the growth at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $4,921 million, primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and increased commercial aviation support activities. IDS revenues decreased by $359 million, primarily due to lower revenues in N&SS resulting from the formation of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture in 2006 and lower revenues in BMA, offset by growth in GS&S. BCC revenues decreased by $210 million primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Unallocated items and eliminations changed by $524 million primarily due to fewer Commercial Airplanes intercompany deliveries when compared with 2006. Earnings from Operations The following table summarizes our earnings from operations: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Commercial Airplanes 1,186 $ 3,584 $ 2,733 Integrated Defense Systems 3,232 3,440 3,031 Boeing Capital Corporation 162 234 291 Other (307 ) (331 ) (813 ) Unallocated items and eliminations (323 ) (1,097 ) (1,657 ) Settlement with U.S. Department of Justice, net of accruals (571 ) Earnings from operations $ 3,950 $ 5,830 $ 3,014 Operating earnings in 2008 decreased by $1,880 million compared with 2007. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $2,398 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to fewer new airplane deliveries resulting from the strike, increased program infrastructure costs related to the strike and revised schedules on 787 and 747 8, and a charge taken on the 747 8 program. Commercial Airplanes research and development expense decreased by $124 million to $2,838 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower spending on 787 partially offset by higher spending on 747 8 and lower supplier development cost sharing payments. IDS earnings decreased by $208 million compared with 2007 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from a $248 million charge taken on the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C). BCC operating earnings decreased $72 million reflecting lower revenues and a provision for losses partially offset by lower interest expense. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2008 improved by $774 million compared with 2007, which is further explained in the table below. Operating earnings in 2007 improved by $2,816 million compared with 2006. The increase is partly due to the $571 million global settlement with U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DoJ) that occurred in the second quarter of 2006. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $851 million compared with the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, commercial aviation support activities and improved cost performance offset by increased research and development expense. Commercial Airplanes research and development expense increased by $572 million to $2,962 million compared with the same period 2006, primarily due to spending on the 787 and 747 8 programs. IDS earnings increased by $409 million compared with 2006. The increase is primarily due to 2006 charges of $770 million in the BMA segment related to AEW&C, partially offset by lower 2007 earnings on several programs in the BMA and N&SS segments. BCC operating earnings decreased $57 million reflecting lower revenues partially offset by a recovery of losses and lower expenses. Other segment earnings improved by $482 million primarily due to the absence of losses related to Connexion by Boeing, which included a charge of $320 million to exit this business in 2006. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2007 contributed $560 million to the 2007 earnings improvement, which is further explained in the table below. 21 Table of Contents The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Pension and other postretirement $ (287 ) $ (686 ) $ (472 ) Share based plans (149 ) (233 ) (680 ) Deferred compensation benefit/(expense) 223 (51 ) (211 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (110 ) (127 ) (294 ) Total $ (323 ) $ (1,097 ) $ (1,657 ) We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,132 million, $1,773 million and $1,663 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, earnings from operations included $1,203 million, $1,730 million and $1,227 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. Pension and other postretirement expense decreased during 2008 when compared with 2007 primarily due to a decrease in overall pension costs compared to the same period in the prior year. Pension and other postretirement expense increased during 2007 when compared with 2006 primarily due to increased overall pension costs recognized in inventory as of December 31, 2006, which were subsequently expensed in cost of sales in 2007. The reduction in Share based plans expense is primarily due to the expiration of certain Performance Shares during 2008 and higher expense acceleration during 2007, resulting from six payouts compared with zero payouts in 2008. The reduction in Share based plans expense during 2007 is primarily due to lower Performance Shares outstanding in 2007 and higher expense acceleration during 2006, resulting from 12 payouts compared with six payouts in 2007. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. Other unallocated items and expense includes a charge related to satellite litigation of $100 million, offset by lower performance based compensation in 2008. Other unallocated items and expense in 2007 decreased as a result of reduced intercompany profit elimination as a result of fewer intercompany deliveries than the previous year. 22 Table of Contents Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Earnings from operations $ 3,950 $ 5,830 $ 3,014 Other income, net 247 484 420 Interest and debt expense (202 ) (196 ) (240 ) Earnings before income taxes 3,995 6,118 3,194 Income tax expense (1,341 ) (2,060 ) (988 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 2,654 $ 4,058 $ 2,206 Other income, which primarily consists of interest income, was lower in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances. Other income was higher in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of increases in average principal balances and higher average rates of return on cash and investments. Interest and debt expense remained flat in 2008 but decreased in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to debt repayments. The effective income tax rates were 33.6% and 33.7% for 2008 and 2007. The effective income tax rate of 33.7% for 2007 differed from the 2006 effective income tax rate of 30.9% primarily due to Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income exclusion tax benefits that existed in 2006, but did not recur in 2007. This was partially offset by the non deduction in 2006 of the global settlement with the U.S. DoJ and other income tax provision adjustments. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes see Note 4. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non U.S. government contract funding. Contractual backlog increased by $26,896 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of increases at Commercial Airplanes of $23,399 million, which were due to new orders in excess of deliveries for our 737NG, 767, 777 and 787 programs. IDS contractual backlog increased by $3,497 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to international orders for F 15 and C 17 aircraft. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in total Unobligated backlog during 2008 is primarily due to decreases at IDS of $2,174 million compared with 2007 primarily due to funding of existing multi year contracts including the F/A 18, Future Combat Systems (FCS), and F 22 programs. These decreases were partially offset by multi year procurement contracts awarded on the V 22 and Chinook programs. The decrease in total Unobligated backlog during 2007 is primarily due to decreases at IDS of $3,492 million compared with 2006 primarily due to funding of existing multi year contracts on FCS, Proprietary, C 17, P 8A and F/A 18, partially offset by increases in the F 22 program and several GS&S programs. 23 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment For the worlds airlines, 2008 was a challenging year characterized by volatility of several key operational factors including oil prices, economic growth, exchange rates and financing terms. In the first half of the year, airlines focused on adapting to spiking oil prices which peaked close to $150/barrel in July. In the second half of 2008, the focus turned to the implications of the global credit crisis and recession as fuel prices fell below $40/barrel for the first time since 2004. Air traffic growth declined toward the end of the year as higher fares to cover higher fuel costs earlier in the year and the economic slowdown reduced demand for air travel. The impact to airline operations and profitability was dramatic. Globally, over 25 airlines entered bankruptcy, and airlines curtailed capacity growth by cutting unprofitable routes and flights, reducing utilization, and parking older generation airplanes. Following its first profitable year since 2000 in 2007, the airline industry fell back into losses in 2008 led by U.S. airlines. U.S. airlines were most exposed to the fuel price shock due to limited hedging and a weakening dollar, but as the demand environment deteriorated, airlines in all regions faced lower profit outlooks by the end of 2008. The near term outlook is highly uncertain due to the volatility of key drivers such as economic growth and fuel prices. Near term air traffic growth forecasts vary significantly but generally indicate minimal to negative growth in 2009. Early 2009 airline schedules show a 2% 3% decline in world capacity as airlines attempt to match capacity with air travel demand. Profitability forecasts for 2009 also range widely both at the global as well as regional levels. Airlines continue to cut non fuel costs including distribution, labor and overhead but significant uncertainty remains around fuel prices and revenues. From time to time certain customers may request cancelations, modifications, or rescheduling of their existing orders to meet revised fleet plans. Whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted, the type of aircraft, how much compensation is paid to us for costs already incurred and our ability to reschedule other orders to replace those canceled, modified, or rescheduled. The fundamental drivers of air travel growth are a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Beyond the near term market uncertainties, our 20 year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger traffic, and 6% per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $3.2 trillion market for 29,400 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian flu), terrorism, and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. 24 Table of Contents Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns. Approximately 10% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog in dollar terms is with U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100 seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China, and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 150 seat aircraft market over the next few years. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in 2007 puts pressure on competitors revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing, and or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 28,263 $ 33,386 $ 28,465 % of Total company revenues 46 % 50 % 46 % Earnings from operations $ 1,186 $ 3,584 $ 2,733 Operating margins 4.2 % 10.7 % 9.6 % Research and development $ 2,838 $ 2,962 $ 2,390 Contractual backlog $ 278,575 $ 255,176 $ 174,276 Revenues Year over year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2008vs 2007 2007vs 2006 New airplane sales $ (4,876 ) $ 3,369 Aircraft trading (264 ) 120 Commercial aviation services business 17 1,432 Total $ (5,123 ) $ 4,921 25 Table of Contents The decrease in revenue of $5,123 million in 2008 from 2007 is primarily attributable to lower new airplane deliveries. The IAM strike resulted in 104 airplane deliveries moving out of 2008 which reduced 2008 revenues by $6,406 million. The strike impact was partially offset by higher intercompany revenues of $804 million, and higher pre strike deliveries, net of model mix changes, of $726 million. Aircraft trading activity decreased by $264 million as a result of fewer sales of used aircraft. Revenues in commercial aviation services business increased by $17 million driven by increased spares and services revenue offset by decreased passenger to freighter conversions. The increase in revenue of $4,921 million in 2007 from 2006 is attributable to increased new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $3,369 million, increased commercial aviation services business of $1,432 million and increased aircraft trading activity of $120 million. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: 717 737 NG 747 767 777 Total 2008 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,756 1,410 969 748 Deliveries 290 * 14 10 * 61 375 2007 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,466 1,396 959 687 Deliveries 330 * 16 12 * 83 441 2006 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,136 1,380 947 604 Deliveries 5 (3) 302 * 14 12 * 65 398 * Intercompany deliveries were two 767 aircraft and two 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2008, one 767 aircraft and one 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2007 and two 767 aircraft and eight 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2006. Earnings from Operations Earnings from operations decreased by $2,398 million in 2008 when compared with 2007, a decrease in operating margins of 6.5 percentage points to 4.2%. Lower new airplane deliveries, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues, reduced earnings by $1,400 million. A charge for a reach forward loss on the 747 program resulting from increases to estimated costs for development and production of 747 8 derivatives reduced 2008 earnings by $685 million. Infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747 8 schedule delays and infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike reduced earnings by $287 million. The 787 and 747 8 schedule delays resulted in production programs receiving larger allocations of current and future infrastructure costs and reduced margins on 2008 deliveries, while the program infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike decreased margins on airplanes delivered during the second half of the year. Increased period cost and other performance reduced earnings by $108 million. A reduction in commercial aviation services volume and mix related earnings of $42 million was primarily due to a decrease in volume on passenger to freighter conversion programs. Lower research and development costs improved earnings by $124 million. Earnings from operations increased by $851 million in 2007 when compared with 2006, an increase in operating margins of 1.1 percentage points to 10.7%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in new airplane deliveries of $950 million, improved cost performance of $169 million and commercial aviation services business increase of $304 million. These were offset by increased research and development costs of $572 million. 26 Table of Contents Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The backlog increase in 2008 related to orders in excess of deliveries for our 737NG, 767, 777 and 787 programs, while the increase in 2007 related to orders in excess of deliveries for all programs. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts and is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts. It is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. 27 Table of Contents The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: Program 737 NG 747 767 777 787 2008 Program accounting quantities 4,200 1,499 1,023 1,050 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 2,270 114 70 350 910 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 5,026 1,524 1,039 1,098 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 2007 Program accounting quantities 3,800 1,474 998 950 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,076 125 52 357 817 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 4,542 1,521 1,011 1,044 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 2006 Program accounting quantities 3,200 1,449 985 900 * Undelivered units under firm orders 1,560 116 28 299 448 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 3,696 1,496 975 903 Anticipated orders N/A N/A 8 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A 1 % N/A * The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2010. 1 Undelivered units are not adjusted for cancellations subsequent to December 31, 2008. 2 Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 737 Next Generation The accounting quantity for the 737 Next Generation program increased by 400 units during 2008 due to the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program In November 2008, we announced a revised schedule for the delivery of the 747 8 Freighter and Intercontinental airplanes. Deliveries of the first 747 8 Freighter moved from the fourth quarter of 2009 into the third quarter of 2010. Delivery of the 747 8 Intercontinental moved from the fourth quarter of 2010 into the second quarter of 2011. The schedule change was caused by design changes, limited availability of engineering resources and the recent IAM strike. In the third quarter of 2008, we increased our cost estimates to incorporate the anticipated schedule delay and design changes and reduced margins on the 747 program to zero. We experienced further cost growth in the fourth quarter and recorded a charge of $685 million to recognize a reach forward loss. The charge is primarily related to higher than anticipated costs due to late changes to wing design which drove new load requirements into the fuselage and created other statement of work changes for our suppliers. Design and load changes also reduced commonality with 747 400 and resulted in increased costs for components and systems. Higher pension costs, infrastructure cost shifts, delays in transitioning certain components to suppliers and higher internal production costs also increased cost estimates. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, this remains a development program, with the associated inherent risks. 28 Table of Contents The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units in 2008. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 25 units during 2008. On February 29, 2008, the U.S. Air Force announced it had chosen a competitors bid over our proposed 767 derivative to build 179 replacement tankers for the Air Forces aging KC 135 fleet of air to air refueling tankers. On March 11, 2008, we filed a formal protest with the Government Accountability Office, citing irregularities with the process of the tanker competition and the evaluation of the competitors bids. On June 18, 2008, the Government Accountability Office sustained our protest of the contract award. On September 10, 2008, the Department of Defense notified the Congress and the two competing contractors, Boeing and Northrop Grumman, that it was terminating the current competition for a U.S. Air Force airborne tanker replacement. We anticipate that the tanker competition will re open in 2009. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2008. Delivery of the first 777 Freighter is scheduled for early 2009. 787 Program We are in the final stages of assembly of the initial airplanes and planning for flight test. The risks that are always inherent in the latter stages of new airplane program production remain. We continue to address challenges associated with assembly of the first few airplanes, including management of our extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, weight and systems integration. We are also continuing efforts to satisfy customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft. During 2008, we announced schedule delays for the 787 airplane. First flight of the 787 8 airplane has moved from the second quarter of 2008 into the second quarter of 2009. Delivery of the first 787 moved from early 2009 into the first quarter of 2010. Delivery schedules for 787 derivative airplanes may also be impacted. The revised schedule reflects the cumulative impacts of disruption caused by the recent IAM strike, the requirement to replace certain fasteners in early production airplanes, as well as the impact from the challenges mentioned above. We continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including delivery delays and supplier assertions associated with such changes. A number of our customers have contractual remedies that may be implicated by our revised plan for the 787. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. 29 Table of Contents Our Research and development expense decreased $124 million in 2008. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The decrease in research and development spending for 2008 was primarily due to reduced 787 product development activities partially offset by $278 million of increased spending on the 747 8 program and $80 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. Our Research and development expense increased $572 million in 2007. The increase in 2007 was due to higher spending of $542 million, primarily on 787 and 747 8, and $30 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. Additional Considerations In 2008, we recorded a reach forward loss on the 747 program and announced additional delays and challenges on the 787 program that highlight the risks that are always inherent in new airplane programs and derivative airplanes. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are generally expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. While firm fixed price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price and result in higher period costs for research and development or reduce margins on future deliveries or in a material charge if the program has or is determined to have a reach forward loss. Changes to estimates of the program accounting quantity, production costs and rates, learning curve and costs of derivatives could also result in lower margins or reach forward losses. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Examples of such commercial development programs include the 787, 747 8 and 777 freighter. Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS consists of three capabilities driven businesses: Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA), Network and Space Systems (N&SS), and Global Services and Support (GS&S). Defense Environment Overview The U.S. is faced with the continuing struggle to balance funding priorities for current irregular threats while preparing for potential threats from near peer states with growing sophistication and military means. The U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the latest National Defense Strategy. All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including dealing with the economic crisis. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging well into the next decade. Policies of the new administration will impact the defense environment and will likely include a complete review of the defense budget in FY2010 and beyond, more emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances, and reforms to the defense acquisition process. 30 Table of Contents Because U.S. DoD spending was about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately 80% of IDS revenue in 2008, the trends and drivers associated with the U.S. DoD budget are critical. Although the U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, we anticipate the growth rate to level off over the next several years. In addition to the fiscal year 2009 discretionary budget request of $515 billion, the President submitted supplemental requests totaling $70 billion. Procurement and Research and Development accounts continue to face increasing budgetary pressures due to growing requirements from Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and personnel costs tied to U.S. commitments overseas. However, this trend is partially offset by equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development. Near term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the 2009 to 2010 period for investment efforts with greater concern existing for the period following U.S. troop draw downs in Iraq. We continue to see pressure to significantly reduce emergency supplemental requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the Global War on Terror. It is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives. This imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize utilization of off the shelf solutions and network enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), long range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, cyber security, precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons as well as continued outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. While international defense markets have not demonstrated the dramatic increases experienced by the U.S. market in recent years they have reversed the declining trend seen in the 1990s. The procurement deferrals taken by international countries has resulted in growing demands for new equipment to address operational requirements, aging inventories, and changing threat environments. Asymmetric warfare remains a key challenge with many nations placing renewed emphasis on acquiring material that is deployable, survivable, and interoperable with the international community. Similar to the U.S., many European nations are facing pressures in their O&M and personnel budgets that are squeezing funding for investment. Middle Eastern markets continue to spend significant amounts on new equipment; however, the impact from volatile oil prices has the potential to affect willingness to commit extra budgetary resources. In Asia growth is continuing with multiple nations pursuing major new acquisitions to address growing regional threats. The international market will be affected by the global economic challenges; however, the continuing threat environment should keep the market stable in 2009. Federal Market Environment We continue to see growth in the needs of Federal customers particularly for the Intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security. Areas such as cyber security, border protection, and infrastructure security have increased in importance in order to meet the needs of the national security environment. We also anticipate a continuation of the trend toward outsourcing federal and government services. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has had stable annual funding in this decade. NASAs budget remains focused on needed funds for Space Shuttle Operations, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. NASA is continuing to pursue elements of the Vision for Space Exploration, which will provide additional opportunities in launch activities and research and development. 31 Table of Contents Commercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade. Despite improvement in market demand the industry continues to be characterized by overcapacity creating strong competitive pressures on pricing. Segment Name Changes In the third quarter of 2008, we changed the names of the Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems segment to Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) and the Support Systems segment to Global Services and Support (GS&S). IDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2008 and 2007, certain programs were realigned between IDS segments. In addition, certain environmental remediation contracts (formerly included in N&SS) were transferred to the Other Segment. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 21. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 32,047 $ 32,052 $ 32,411 % of Total company revenues 53 % 48 % 53 % Earnings from operations $ 3,232 $ 3,440 $ 3,031 Operating margins 10.1 % 10.7 % 9.4 % Research and development $ 933 $ 848 $ 786 Contractual backlog $ 45,285 $ 41,788 $ 42,287 Unobligated backlog $ 27,719 $ 29,893 $ 33,385 Since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts, or as one large multi year order or long term award. As a result, period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues IDS revenues were unchanged in 2008 as revenue growth in GS&S was offset by decreases in BMA and N&SS. IDS revenues decreased by 1% in 2007 primarily due to the exclusion of the government Delta volume from N&SS revenues, now a revenue component for our joint venture ULA. Decreased revenue from this exclusion and lower revenues in the BMA segment were partially offset by increased volume in other N&SS programs and growth in the GS&S segment. Operating Earnings IDS earnings, which include the effects of the IAM strike, decreased by $208 million in 2008 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from a $248 million charge taken on the AEW&C program in the second quarter partially offset by higher earnings in the N&SS Segment. IDS operating earnings increased by $409 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to $770 million of charges on AEW&C in 2006. The 2007 increase was partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment and other BMA programs. 32 Table of Contents Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. IDS total backlog increased 2% in 2008, from $71,681 million to $73,004 million, primarily due to multi year contracts for the V 22 and Chinook and international orders for F 15 and C 17 aircraft. The increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the FCS, C 17, F/A 18 and F 22 programs. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Airborne Laser, EA 18G, Family of Beyond Line of Sight Terminals, FCS, Ground based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), P 8A and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEW&C, international KC 767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation. Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 13,492 $ 13,740 $ 14,142 % of Total company revenues 22 % 21 % 23 % Earnings from operations $ 1,276 $ 1,649 $ 1,218 Operating margins 9.5 % 12.0 % 8.6 % Research and development $ 482 $ 450 $ 395 Contractual backlog $ 25,855 $ 23,047 $ 24,885 Unobligated backlog $ 10,057 $ 8,625 $ 8,891 Revenues BMA revenues decreased 2% in 2008 and 3% in 2007. The decrease of $248 million in 2008 is primarily driven by lower F 22, Apache, F 18 and Chinook revenue partially offset by increased deliveries on F 15 and International KC 767 Tankers and C 17 contract mix. The decrease of $402 million in 2007 was due to reduced deliveries of the Apache and T 45 aircraft and Joint Direct Attack Munitions, partially offset by higher deliveries of Chinook and F/A 18 aircraft and higher volume on the P 8A program. 33 Table of Contents Deliveries of new build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 F/A 18 Models 45 44 42 T 45TS Goshawk 7 9 13 F 15E Eagle 14 12 12 C 17 Globemaster 16 16 16 KC 767 Tanker 2 CH 47 Chinook 12 10 2 AH 64 Apache 3 17 31 C 40A Clipper 3 1 Total New Build Production Aircraft 99 111 117 Operating Earnings BMA operating earnings decreased by $373 million in 2008 primarily due to a charge of $248 million taken on the AEW&C program in the second quarter. Delivery mix, lower volume and the IAM strike also contributed to the decrease in 2008. Operating earnings increased by $431 million in 2007 primarily due to the 2006 charges of $770 million on AEW&C, which were partially offset by lower 2007 earnings due to revised cost estimates on the international KC 767 Tanker program, lower prices on the C 17 program and revised cost and revenue estimates on the AEW&C program. Research and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical strength and large scale integration capabilities that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighters enduring needs. Research and development has remained consistent over the past several years. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers capabilities in the areas of mobility, precision effects, situational awareness and survivability. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability, and improving affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Backlog BMA total backlog increased by 13% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in the V 22, Chinook and F 15 program backlog. These increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the C 17 and F/A 18 programs. Total backlog decreased by 6% in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to deliveries and sales on C 17, F/A 18, P 8A and F 15. These decreases were partially offset by a multi year contract for F 22 aircraft and international orders for AEW&C and F/A 18 aircraft. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on BMA operations include the following: AEW&C During 2006, we recorded charges of $770 million and during the second quarter of 2008 we recorded a charge of $248 million related to revised cost and revenue estimates to complete the AEW&C programs in Australia and Turkey. The 2008 charge is primarily related to our program in Australia and is due to subsystem development issues on the electronic warfare and ground support systems and the additional time required for integration testing. These factors required a revised delivery schedule for the Australian aircraft. These delays are not expected to affect delivery schedules to our other AEW&C customers. The AEW&C development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of a 737 700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which 34 Table of Contents have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle and Peace Eye include four aircraft each. These are advanced and complex fixed price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. International KC 767 Tanker Program During 2008 and 2007, the BMA segment recorded charges of $85 million and $152 million. The 2007 charge was partially offset at the consolidated level. The international KC 767 Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. We delivered the first two tankers to Japan during the first quarter of 2008. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. C 17 As of December 31, 2008, we delivered 182 of the 190 C 17 aircraft ordered by the U.S. Air Force (USAF), with final deliveries scheduled for 2009. In June 2007 and April 2008, we directed key suppliers to begin work on 10 and 20 aircraft, respectively, beyond the 190 to support potential Fiscal Year 2008 (FY08) and Fiscal Year 2009 (FY09) orders and anticipated international orders. Our authorizations allowed us to maintain the current C 17 production rate and to provide for cost effective acquisition of the aircraft. As of December 31, 2008, inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers, primarily related to the anticipated FY08 USAF order, totaled approximately $720 million. In June 2008, the FY08 supplemental defense spending bill, signed by the President, included funding for up to an additional 15 C 17 aircraft. The USAF placed these aircraft on contract on February 6, 2009. There continues to be substantial interest in purchasing additional C 17 aircraft from both the U.S. government and international customers. The National Defense Authorization Act signed into law by the President authorizes the procurement of six C 17s in FY09. However, funding would need to be addressed in a future defense appropriations bill. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2009 to complete production of the C 17. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut down, including any recovery that would be available from the government. Such recovery from the government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from our direction to key suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond the 190 ordered by the USAF. Network and Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 11,338 $ 11,475 $ 11,767 % of Total company revenues 19 % 17 % 19 % Earnings from operations $ 1,033 $ 862 $ 924 Operating margins 9.1 % 7.5 % 7.9 % Research and development $ 298 $ 289 $ 289 Contractual backlog $ 8,864 $ 9,204 $ 7,784 Unobligated backlog $ 16,980 $ 20,133 $ 23,755 35 Table of Contents Revenues N&SS revenues decreased 1% in 2008 and 2% in 2007. The decrease of $137 million in 2008 is primarily due to decreased revenues in FCS, Proprietary and satellite programs partially offset by increased revenues in the SBInet program. The decrease of $292 million in 2007 was primarily due to the exclusion of government Delta volume, now a component of our equity investment in ULA and lower FCS volume, partially offset by increased volume on SBInet and several satellite programs. Delta launch and new build satellite deliveries were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Delta II Commercial 2 3 Delta II Government 2 Delta IV Government 3 Satellites 1 4 4 Delta government launches are excluded from our deliveries after December 1, 2006 due to the formation of ULA. Operating Earnings N&SS operating earnings increased by $171 million in 2008 was primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in ULA. The decrease in 2007 was due to lower earnings on FCS and several satellite programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher award fees on GMD and a $44 million gain on sale of a property in Anaheim. N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $73 million, $85 million and $71 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively and equity earnings of $105 million, a loss of $11 million and equity earnings of $5 million from the ULA joint venture in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The ULA equity earnings and loss amounts are net of the basis difference amortization. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications, command and control, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems (C4ISR); communications and command and control (C3) capabilities that support a network enabled architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in communications capabilities to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include JTRS, FCS, Global Positioning System, Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, Ares 1 Crew Launch Vehicle and GMD. Investments were also made to support concepts that may lead to the development of next generation space intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network enabled capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. Backlog N&SS total backlog decreased by 12% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi year orders received in prior years on FCS, GMD and C3 programs, partially offset by an increase in the International Space Station program. Total backlog decreased by 7% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to revenues recognized on FCS and Proprietary programs, partially offset by an increase in Space Exploration programs. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on N&SS operations include the following: United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we completed the transaction with Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) to create a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. (ULA). ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. In connection with the transaction, 36 Table of Contents we initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. The book value of our investment exceeds our proportionate share of ULAs net assets. This difference will be expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $15 million annually for the next 16 years. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each committed to provide up to $25 million in additional capital contributions and we each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. ULA made a $100 million earnings distribution to each partner during the fourth quarter of 2008. In conjunction with the distribution, we and Lockheed committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions up to the amount of such distributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under the inventory supply agreement. See Note 6 and Note 10. We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non recoverability of $1,375 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA sold $548 million of inventories that were contributed by us. As part of its integration, ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. Future decisions regarding the Delta II program could reduce our earnings by up to $90 million. We agreed to indemnify ULA in the event ULA is unable to obtain re pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ULA and to which we believe ULA is entitled. We will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to $386 million in pre tax losses related to these contracts. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers. We issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing and other support. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we believe we can recover a portion of the cost (estimated at $271 million) through guarantees from the other venture partners. We have also made loans directly to Sea Launch in the past. In the event that Sea Launch is unable to repay those loans, we believe we can recover a portion of the cost (estimated at $203 million) from the other venture partners. The components of this exposure are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) EstimatedMaximumExposure EstablishedReserves EstimatedProceedsfromRecourse EstimatedNetExposure Credit guarantees $ 451 $ 180 $ 271 Partner Loans (principal and interest) 508 305 203 Trade receivable from Sea Launch 385 377 8 Subcontract termination 7 7 Other receivables and Inventory 62 41 21 $ 1,413 $ 903 $ 474 $ 36 We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2008. Our trade receivable increased from $337 million at December 31, 2007 to $385 37 Table of Contents million at December 31, 2008. The related allowance for losses increased from $334 million at December 31, 2007 to $377 million at December 31, 2008 reflecting Sea Launchs ongoing liquidity challenges. The venture conducted five, zero and five successful launches for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The venture has incurred losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006. The losses in 2008 and 2006 were due to the relatively low price of launches, driven by a depressed commercial satellite market and oversupply of launch vehicles as well as a high level of debt and debt servicing requirements. The venture incurred losses in 2007 due to a delay in its 2007 launch manifest that was caused by a launch anomaly in January 2007 and unusually strong ocean currents at the launch site during November and December. We suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to Sea Launch down to zero in 2001 and accruing our obligation for third party guarantees on Sea Launch indebtedness. We are not obligated to provide any further financial support to the Sea Launch venture. However, in the event that we do extend additional financial support to Sea Launch in the future, we will recognize suspended losses as appropriate. Approximately $250 million of Sea Launchs bank loans expire during 2009. In the event this amount is refinanced, Boeing may be called upon to renew its credit guarantee to Sea Launch lenders; or, in the event Sea Launch is unable to obtain financing, Boeing may be required to perform on the existing credit guarantee, which could put in default Sea Launchs other external debt of approximately $200 million. In the event Sea Launch is unable to refinance its debt or meet its other contractual obligations and we are unable to recover guarantees from the other venture partners, we could be required to pay up to $451 million under credit guarantees, which could result in charges of up to $510 million. We continue to look at alternatives to address funding requirements for the venture. Satellites See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) in Note 20 Legal Proceedings. Global Services and Support Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 7,217 $ 6,837 $ 6,502 % of Total company revenues 12 % 10 % 11 % Earnings from operations $ 923 $ 929 $ 889 Operating margins 12.8 % 13.6 % 13.7 % Research and development $ 153 $ 109 $ 102 Contractual backlog $ 10,566 $ 9,537 $ 9,618 Unobligated backlog $ 682 $ 1,135 $ 739 Revenues GS&S revenues increased $380 million in 2008 and $335 million in 2007, an increase of 6% and 5%. The 2008 increase was due to higher revenues in the Training Systems and Services (TS&S) and Integrated Logistics (IL) divisions partially offset by decreases in International Support program volume. The 2007 increase was due to higher IL program volume resulting from the 2006 acquisition of Aviall, Inc. (Aviall) and increased revenue on the C 17 support program. Higher international program volume in 2007 was the result of our increased ownership in Alsalam Aircraft Company (Alsalam) 38 Table of Contents which occurred during the second quarter of 2006. Lower volume on several Maintenance, Modification and Upgrades (MM&U) and TS&S programs partially offset the 2007 increases. Operating Earnings GS&S operating earnings decreased by less than 1% in 2008 due to changes in the contract mix and disposition of contract matters. Operating earnings increased 4% in 2007 driven by the revenue increases mentioned above in addition to a different contract mix. Research and Development GS&S continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, MM&U, TS&S and Advanced Logistics Support Systems, as well as on moving into the innovative Network Centric Logistics areas. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C 17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A 18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, and the F 15 Singapore Performance Based Logistics contract. Successful development of adaptable systems has allowed GS&S to transition off Boeing platforms and into the broader aviation market. Beyond aerospace, GS&S capabilities have created opportunities in adjacencies exemplified in 2008 through entrance into the land vehicles market. Backlog GS&S total backlog increased by 5% compared with 2007 primarily due to increases in IL and International Support programs. Total backlog increased by 3% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to increases in TS&S programs and International Support programs which were partially offset by decreases in MM&U and IL programs. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 totaled $6,023 million, which was substantially collateralized by Boeing produced commercial aircraft. A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airlines customers. Continued problems in the airline industry could have a negative impact on lease rates, airline credit ratings and aircraft valuations, and BCCs future results of operations could be adversely affected in the form of lower revenues, increased asset impairments, increased allowance for losses and increased redeployment costs. Continued problems in the airline industry could also affect our Commercial Airplanes and Other segment. The global credit crisis has affected the availability of credit generally. While there are still sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries, the amount of third party financing available has declined. We expect to finance some new deliveries of Boeing aircraft in 2009 and expect our portfolio size to increase. Once capital market conditions improve, we believe the overall aircraft financing market should improve as well and lessen the need for us to provide financing for Boeing aircraft deliveries, although we can provide no assurance when that will occur. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western built commercial jet aircraft (11.0% of current world fleet) were parked as of December 2008, including both in production and out of production aircraft types, of which over 40% are not expected to return to service. In December 2007 and 2006, 8.2% and 9.9% of the western built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. 39 Table of Contents Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 703 $ 815 $ 1,025 Earnings from operations $ 162 $ 234 $ 291 Operating margins 23 % 29 % 28 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCCs revenues decreased $112 million in 2008, resulting from lower interest income on financing receivables and notes of $66 million primarily due to the prepayment of certain notes and lower investment income of $20 million resulting from a lower investment balance. BCCs revenues decreased $210 million in 2007, primarily due to lower interest income on notes receivable, lower investment income and lower net gain on disposal of assets. Operating earnings BCCs operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $72 million in 2008 primarily due to lower revenues and a provision for losses partially offset by lower interest expense. The decrease in operating earnings in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to lower revenues. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31,: (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 6,023 $ 6,532 Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables 2.1 % 2.5 % Debt $ 3,652 $ 4,327 Debt to Equity Ratio 5.0 to 1 5.0 to 1 BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 decreased from December 31, 2007 due to normal portfolio run off. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, BCC had $685 million and $86 million of assets that were held for sale or re lease of which $305 million and $86 million had firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. The increase in assets held for sale or re lease primarily resulted from the return of 16 717 aircraft previously leased to Midwest Airlines (Midwest) and the return of four 757 aircraft previously leased to ATA Holdings Corp., which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 2, 2008. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $168 million are scheduled to be returned off lease in the next 12 months. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and $64 million were committed at December 31, 2008. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. 40 Table of Contents Restructurings and Restructuring Requests As of December 31, 2008, BCC has received a number of requests from both domestic and foreign airlines to reduce lease or rental payments or to otherwise restructure obligations. Whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted, the type of aircraft, the collateral value and market rental rates of the returned aircraft. In September 2008, we agreed to a restructuring of lease terms with Midwest, under which Midwest returned 16 of 25 717 aircraft. Additionally, the agreement provides us with options to require Midwest to return the remaining nine 717 aircraft with varying notice periods. We are pursuing remarketing options for the aircraft returned to date and expected to be returned in the future. We do not expect that the return of these aircraft as a result of this restructuring will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 567 $ 308 $ 327 Earnings from operations $ (307 ) $ (331 ) $ (813 ) Operating margins 54 % 107 % 249 % Effective January 1, 2008, certain intercompany items were realigned between the Other segment and Unallocated expense. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $259 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the sale of four C 17 aircraft held under operating lease, three of which were sold in 2008. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $24 million compared with 2007 primarily due to lower environmental and certain other charges offset by the recognition of a provision for losses of $82 million related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. The provision for losses amount has been recorded in the Other segment as a result of intercompany guarantees we provide to BCC. In 2008, Other segment included environmental remediation expense of $59 million compared with $109 million in 2007. Other segment operating losses were $331 million during 2007 as compared to losses of $813 million in 2006. The reduction of $482 million was primarily due to the absence of losses related to Connexion by Boeing, which we exited in 2006. As part of our exit from this business, we recognized a charge of $320 million in 2006, in addition to losses of $237 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We have not reached final settlements with all customers or suppliers. We do not believe the final settlements will have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and or financial position. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net earnings $ 2,672 $ 4,074 $ 2,215 Non cash items 1,829 1,753 2,351 Changes in working capital (4,902 ) 3,757 2,933 Net cash (used)/provided by operating activities (401 ) 9,584 7,499 Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities 1,888 (3,822 ) (3,186 ) Net cash used by financing activities (5,202 ) (4,884 ) (3,645 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (59 ) 46 38 Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents (3,774 ) 924 706 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 7,042 6,118 5,412 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 3,268 $ 7,042 $ 6,118 Operating Activities In 2008, operating activities resulted in a $401 million cash outflow in contrast to 2007 and 2006 when our operations generated significant cash surpluses of $9,584 million and $7,499 million. The decline in 2008 was primarily attributable to higher working capital requirements. In 2007 and 2006, customer advances increased at a faster rate than inventory. In 2008 inventory grew at a faster rate than customer advances. The 2008 increase in inventories was driven by continued spending on production materials, airplane engines, and supplier advances during the IAM strike, lower commercial airplane deliveries and the continued ramp up of the 787 program. We expect to generate positive operating cash flows in 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2,085 million to $9,584 million in 2007, primarily due to an increase in Net earnings. Net working capital improvements in 2007 reflect higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders and decreases in customer financing assets due to pre payment of certain notes receivable and normal portfolio run off, which were partially offset by an increase in inventories driven by the continued ramp up of the 787 program. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1,888 million in 2008 compared with $3,822 million used in 2007, largely due to the liquidation in 2008 of our investments in time deposits and commercial paper, and the liquidation of the majority of our investments in externally managed fixed income instruments, partially offset by $964 million of spending in 2008 on acquisitions. Cash used for investing activities increased to $3,822 million in 2007 from $3,186 million in 2006, largely due to increases in short term investments, partially offset by our investment in the acquisition of Aviall in 2006. 42 Table of Contents The balance of time deposits, commercial paper and externally managed fixed income instruments classified as investments at December 31 are summarized in the table below. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Classified as Short term investments Time deposits $ 1,025 Commercial paper 799 Externally managed fixed income instruments(1) $ 10 306 $ 257 10 2,130 257 Classified as Investments Externally managed fixed income instruments(1) 338 2,963 2,923 $ 348 $ 5,093 $ 3,180 (1) Externally managed fixed income instruments consist primarily of investment grade instruments. These investments had an average duration of 5.5 years at December 31, 2008 and are classified as available for sale. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities increased to $5,202 million in 2008 from $4,884 million in 2007 due to repayments of financed purchases of distribution rights, which are agreements with certain vendors that gives us exclusive rights to sell their applicable parts. The increase was also due to a decrease in stock options exercised, an increase in common share repurchases and payments of employee taxes on certain share based payment arrangements, partially offset by a reduction in debt repayments. Cash used by financing activities increased to $4,884 million in 2007 from $3,645 million in 2006 primarily due to increased common share repurchases. During 2008, we repurchased 42,073,885 shares at an average price of $69.79 in our open market share repurchase program, 1,462,776 shares at an average price of $64.95 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 74,824 shares in stock swaps. During 2007, we repurchased 28,995,599 shares at an average price of $95.68 in our open market share repurchase program and 28,432 shares in stock swaps. During 2006, we repurchased 21,184,202 shares at an average price of $80.18 in our open market share repurchase program, 3,749,377 shares at an average price of $80.28 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 49,288 shares in stock swaps. We expect to reduce 2009 share repurchase activity to a minimal level. In 2008, we repaid $738 million of debt, including $709 million of debt held at BCC. In 2007, we repaid $1,406 million of debt, including $1,309 million of debt held at BCC. In 2006, we repaid $1,681 million of debt, including $713 million of debt held at BCC and $458 million of debt assumed in the Aviall acquisition. There were no debt issuances during 2008, 2007, or 2006. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the recorded balance of debt was $7,512 million and $8,217 million, of which $560 million and $762 million were classified as short term. This includes $3,652 million and $4,327 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $528 million and $706 million was classified as short term. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moodys Standard &Poors Long term: Boeing/BCC A+ A2 A+ Short term: Boeing/BCC F1 P 1 A 1 43 Table of Contents On January 29, 2009 Standard & Poors confirmed Boeings A+ credit rating but changed its outlook from stable to negative, citing the challenging commercial aviation environment. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity. Throughout 2008 and at December 31, 2008, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $3,000 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements, of which $2,000 million is a 5 year credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $1,000 million is a 364 day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2009. Both the 5 year and 364 day credit facilities have a one year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates. In 2008, we renewed the $1,000 million 364 day revolving credit facility, of which $500 million is allocated to BCC. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings in 2009. BCC has a $5,000 million shelf registration statement that was declared effective on November 12, 2008 under which it may offer debt securities. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short term and long term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. At this point in time, our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment, and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158), we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, with a corresponding after tax adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The 2008 annual remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement plans resulted in a net $8,565 million decrease in Shareholders equity, primarily due to declines in our pension plan assets, as a result of declines in financial markets. As a result of the pension remeasurement, we have negative Shareholders equity at December 31, 2008. We do not expect negative Shareholders equity to affect our ability to pay dividends or comply with debt covenants. The 2007 annual remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement plans resulted in a net $3,441 million increase in Shareholders equity. At December 31, 2008 our pension plans were $8,420 million underfunded as measured under GAAP and, in the aggregate, approximately $3,000 million underfunded as measured under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The difference in the funded status between the two standards is mostly attributable to the fact that ERISA uses average asset values and discount rates, whereas GAAP requires us to measure our plan assets and discount our benefit obligations as of the end of the year. Required contributions under ERISA, as well as rules governing funding of our non U.S. pension plans, are not expected to exceed $50 million in 2009. We anticipate contributing approximately $500 million to our pension plans in 2009. Absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates, we will be required to make higher contributions in future years. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. 44 Table of Contents Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2008, and the estimated timing thereof. Contractual Obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 1 3years 3 5years After 5years Long term debt (including current portion) $ 7,432 $ 551 $ 1,533 $ 2,495 $ 2,853 Interest on debt* 5,055 453 795 532 3,275 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 11,222 692 1,486 5,139 3,905 Capital lease obligations 81 10 20 22 29 Operating lease obligations 1,171 219 315 148 489 Purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position 114,659 33,960 42,967 27,468 10,264 Purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position 11,338 10,512 488 323 15 Total contractual obligations $ 150,958 $ 46,397 $ 47,604 $ 36,127 $ 20,830 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2008. Variable rate debt was approximately 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2008. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2008, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,195 million, of which $41 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $1,154 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 4. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to a single plan that is funded through a trust. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 10% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement 45 Table of Contents through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2008, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2008, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $9 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2008. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 5,763 $ 5,027 $ 616 $ 120 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 10,145 2,445 2,621 $ 3,054 2,025 Total commercial commitments $ 15,908 $ 7,472 $ 3,237 $ 3,054 $ 2,145 Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers, see Note 11. Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) to finance the purchase and or construction of real and personal property, see Note 12. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20, including our contesting the default termination of the A 12 aircraft, employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees, and litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs. 46 Table of Contents Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $731 million at December 31, 2008. For additional information, see Note 11. Income Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,453 million at December 31, 2008 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 4. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contracts sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2008 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately $320 million. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and 47 Table of Contents anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 program, for all of 2008 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately $200 million. The 747 program is in a reach forward loss position. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. Aircraft Valuation Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. 48 Table of Contents Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customers credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2008, the allowance would have decreased by $109 million or increased by $251 million. If the collateral values were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2008, the allowance would have decreased by $66 million or increased by $71 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease 1%, the allowance would have increased by $5 million or decreased by $5 million. Lease Residual Values Equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases. If the estimated residual values declined 5% at December 31, 2008, this would result in a future cumulative pre tax earnings impact of $75 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which $7 million would be recognized in 2009. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. Since the date of our annual impairment test on April 1, we have updated our forecasts to reflect among other things the global economic downturn, delays in development programs, and the impacts of the recent IAM strike. Because of these changes in circumstances, we have verified that goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2008. However, further changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations will have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. 49 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $499 million of indefinite lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows could result in an impairment charge of approximately $17 million. Postretirement Plans Substantially all our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the expected long term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense and projected benefit obligations. In addition, as a result of our adoption of SFAS 158, differences between actual and expected returns on assets, changes in assumptions, and changes in plan provisions could significantly increase or decrease Shareholders Equity (net of taxes) at future measurement dates. Effective for December 31, 2008, SFAS 158 requires us to measure our plan assets and benefit obligations as of December 31, our year end. Previously, our annual measurement date was September 30. We use a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of our December 31 annual measurement date. Changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to Shareholders Equity as of the measurement date. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. As of December 31, 2008 (in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Dollars Dollars Projected benefit obligation (pensions) (1,350 ) 1,599 Net periodic pension cost (164 ) 181 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (165 ) 180 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (14 ) 14 Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2008 net periodic pension expense by $116 million. For 2009, we are reducing our expected rate of return on pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 8.00% which will increase 2009 net periodic pension cost by approximately $100 million. Differences between actual and expected returns can affect future years pension cost. The asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period. Losses incurred on our pension investments in 2008 will increase 2009 net periodic pension cost by approximately $450 million through a combination of lower expected returns on assets and higher amortization of actuarial losses. Absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates or higher contributions, net periodic pension expense will increase further in future years. 50 Table of Contents The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following years expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally investments, fixed rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. The principal source of BCCs market risk relates to interest rate changes. Exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of BCCs liabilities with that of BCCs assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are tools used to assist with this matching and are not used for speculative purposes. Matching is a dynamic process affected by changes in our assets that may require adjusting our liabilities and or derivatives. Although many of the assets, liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded, if we had an immediate, one time, 100 basis point increase in market rates at December 31, 2008, we estimate that the tax adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by $1 million compared to a decrease of $12 million at December 31, 2007. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing existing debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2008, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized losses by $70 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have decreased our unrealized losses by $196 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 51 Table of Contents
