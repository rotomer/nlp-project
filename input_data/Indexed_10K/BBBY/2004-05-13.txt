ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW In fiscal 2003, the Companys consolidated net sales increased by 22.2% and net earnings increased by 32.2%. Contributing to this increase was the expansion of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB) store space by 12.2%, from 17,255,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2002 to 19,353,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2003. The 2,098,000 square feet increase was primarily the result of opening 85 new BBB stores and relocating two existing stores. In fiscal 2002, the Company expanded BBB store space by 17.2%, or 2,531,000 square feet, from 14,724,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2001. The 2,531,000 square feet increase was the result of opening 95 new stores offset by the closing of one small store. Also contributing to these increases in fiscal 2003 and 2002 were two acquisitions made by the Company. In June 2003, the Company acquired Christmas Tree Shops, Inc. (CTS) for approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, plus the costs of the acquisition, which includes $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over the next three years. CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at low prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods, and seasonal products. CTS results of operations are included in the Companys consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. In March 2002, the Company acquired Harmon Stores, Inc. (Harmon), a health and beauty care retailer, for approximately $24.1 million, net of cash acquired. Harmons results of operations are included in the Companys consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. On a combined basis, CTS and Harmon store space totaled 1,119,000 square feet at February 28, 2004. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2003 increased by approximately 6.3% as compared with an increase of approximately 7.9% and 7.1% in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The fiscal 2003 increase in comparable store sales reflected a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings, a strong focus on customer service and the continued success of the Companys advertising program. The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. 15 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i) selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii) the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: Fiscal Year Ended Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change from Prior Year February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 March 2, 2002 February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 22.2 % 25.2 % Cost of sales 58.1 58.6 58.8 21.2 24.8 Gross profit 41.9 41.4 41.2 23.6 25.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 27.6 28.3 29.4 19.1 20.5 Operating profit 14.3 13.1 11.8 33.2 38.7 Earnings before provision for income taxes 14.5 13.4 12.2 32.2 37.6 Net earnings 8.9 8.2 7.5 32.2 37.6 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2003 increased $812.8 million to $4.478 billion, representing an increase of 22.2% over the $3.665 billion of net sales in fiscal 2002, which increased $737.2 million or 25.2% over net sales of $2.928 billion in fiscal 2001. Approximately 41% of the increase in fiscal 2003 was attributable to BBB new store sales and 34% of the increase was attributable to the net sales of CTS, which was acquired in June 2003. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2003 of 6.3% was due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings, a strong focus on customer service and the continued success of the Companys advertising program. For fiscal 2002, new store sales contributed approximately 68% to the increase in net sales and the balance to an increase in comparable store sales and the acquisition of Harmon in March 2002. Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 51%, 55% and 54% of net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 16%, 19% and 19% of net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 of 49%, 45% and 46%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. The change in the product mix between fiscal 2003 and 2002 is primarily the result of the acquisition of CTS. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001. Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1.877 billion or 41.9% of net sales, $1.519 billion or 41.4% of net sales and $1.208 billion or 41.2% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2003 and 2002 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to improvements in both the markup and in markdowns taken. The slight increase in gross profit between fiscal 2002 and 2001 was the result of 16 improvements in markup on the mix of product purchased in fiscal 2002 offset by the relative increase in markdowns recorded in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1.237 billion or 27.6% of net sales in fiscal 2003 compared to $1.038 billion or 28.3% of net sales in fiscal 2002. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects a decrease in occupancy costs, other store expenses and costs associated with new store openings, partially offset by an increase in litigation expense and net advertising costs. Store opening and expansion costs are charged to earnings as incurred. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.3% in fiscal 2002 from 29.4% in fiscal 2001 primarily as a result of a decrease in occupancy costs and costs associated with new store openings, partially offset by an increase in payroll and payroll related items. SG&A in fiscal 2002 was $1.038 billion as compared to $861.5 million in fiscal 2001. Interest income Interest income decreased to $10.2 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $11.3 million in fiscal 2002 due to a decrease in the average investment interest rate partially offset by an increase in cash invested. However, interest income increased in fiscal 2002 from $11.0 million in fiscal 2001 due to the increase in invested cash partially offset by a decrease in the average investment rate. Income taxes The effective tax rate was 38.5% for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 due to the weighted average effective tax rate remaining consistent in the states and territory in which the Company currently conducts business. EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the twelve year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2003, the chain has grown from 34 to 575 BBB stores. Total BBB stores square footage grew from 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 19,353,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003. There were 30 Harmon stores with 204,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003. There were 24 CTS stores with 915,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003. The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open new BBB, Harmon and CTS stores in fiscal 2004 (see details under Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The Company believes that a predominant portion of any increase in its net sales in fiscal 2004 will continue to be attributable to new store net sales. Accordingly, the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully, of which there can be no assurance. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, through internally generated funds. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 was $548.4 million, compared with $419.3 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in the tax benefit received from the exercise of stock options and improved management of working capital, partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable due to an increase in tax payments. 17 Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 was $292.5 million compared with $357.4 million in fiscal 2002. The change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in the redemption of investment securities partially offset by the acquisition of CTS. The aggregate all cash purchase price of CTS, including the cost of the acquisition, was approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, which includes $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over the next three years. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2003 was $53.4 million, compared with $24.2 million in fiscal 2002. The change in net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the prepayment of CTS debt in conjunction with the acquisition. At February 28, 2004, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $75 million and $50 million, which expire in September 2004 and November 2004, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. It is the Companys intent to maintain an uncommitted line of credit for these purposes. During fiscal 2003, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February 28, 2004, there was approximately $15.0 million in outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at February 28, 2004, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $40 million, primarily for certain insurance programs, of which approximately $35.8 million was outstanding. The Company believes that during fiscal 2004, internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its operations, including its expansion program. The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for store, office and other facilities and equipment and purchase obligations which are payable as of February 28, 2004 as follows: (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Operating Lease Obligations $ 2,727,162 $ 273,934 $ 842,674 $ 514,046 $ 1,096,508 Purchase Obligations 643,994 643,994 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,371,156 $ 917,928 $ 842,674 $ 514,046 $ 1,096,508 As of February 28, 2004, the Company has leased sites for 57 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2004 or 2005, which are included in the table above. Approximate aggregate costs for the 57 leased stores are estimated at $79.9 million for merchandise inventories, $43.1 million for furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements and $11.8 million for store opening expenses (which will be expensed as incurred). Purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise and capital expenditures. Typically, these purchase orders, which are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2004, allow the Company to cancel the orders without recourse. SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, November and December and generally lower in February and March. INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future. 18 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the provision for sales returns, inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, vendor allowances and accruals for self insurance, litigation and store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Sales Returns: Sales returns, which are reserved for based on historical experience, are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded. Inventory Valuation: Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. In addition, the Company estimates a reserve for expected shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of the Companys physical inventory count. At any one time, inventories include items that have been marked down to the Companys best estimate of their fair market value. Actual markdowns required could differ from this estimate. Impairment of Long Lived Assets: The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the present value of the estimated net cash flows. The Company does not believe that any material impairment currently exists related to its long lived assets. Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets: The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually and otherwise when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company does not believe that any material impairment currently exists related to its goodwill and indefinitely lived intangible assets. Vendor Allowances: The Company receives various types of allowances from our merchandise vendors, which are based on negotiated terms. These allowances are recorded when earned as a reduction of cost of sales or as a reduction of other costs in accordance with the provisions of the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 16 Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor. Self Insurance: The Company uses self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by our employees). Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Litigation: The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates as appropriate. 19 Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs: Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs are charged to earnings as incurred. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which was effective for any exit or disposal activity initiated after December 31, 2002, costs related to store relocations and closings were provided for in the period in which management approved the relocation or closing of a store. Actual costs related to store relocations and closings could differ from these estimates. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10 K, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Shareholder Letter, contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions, changes in the retailing environment and consumer spending habits, demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the ability to find suitable locations at reasonable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program; and the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment securities. The Company is adverse to loss of principal and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting market risk. The Companys investment securities consist of fixed rate instruments. The Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of $825.0 million, short term investment securities of $41.6 million and long term investment securities of $210.8 million at weighted average interest rates as of February 28, 2004 of 1.02%, 2.52% and 2.10%, respectively.
