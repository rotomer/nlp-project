ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) operate specialty retail stores nationwide, including stores of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Harmon Stores, Inc. (Harmon) and Christmas Tree Shops, Inc. (CTS), primarily selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates. The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices, introduction of new merchandising offerings and development of our infrastructure. Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, consumer preferences and spending habits, competition from existing and potential competitors, unusual weather patterns and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program. In fiscal 2004, the Companys consolidated net sales increased by 15.0% and net earnings increased by 26.4%. Contributing to this increase was the expansion of BBB store space by 12.1%, from 19,353,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2003 to 21,691,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2004. The 2,338,000 square feet increase was primarily the result of opening 85 new BBB stores and relocating one existing store. Also contributing to this increase in fiscal 2004 was an acquisition made by the Company in June 2003. The Company acquired CTS in fiscal 2003 for approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, including the costs of the acquisition, comprising $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over three years. CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at value prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods and seasonal products. CTS results of operations are included in the Companys consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2004 increased by approximately 4.5% as compared with an increase of approximately 6.3% and 7.9% in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2004, CTS was included in the calculation of comparable store sales. The fiscal 2004 increase in comparable store sales reflected a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced. The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. 15 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i) selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii) the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: Fiscal Year Ended Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change from Prior Year February 26, 2005 February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 February 26, 2005 February 28, 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 15.0 % 22.2 % Cost of sales 57.5 58.1 58.6 13.8 21.2 Gross profit 42.5 41.9 41.4 16.5 23.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 27.1 27.6 28.3 12.7 19.1 Operating profit 15.4 14.3 13.1 23.9 33.2 Earnings before provision for income taxes 15.8 14.5 13.4 24.9 32.2 Net earnings 9.8 8.9 8.2 26.4 32.2 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2004 increased $669.7 million to $5.148 billion, representing an increase of 15.0% over the $4.478 billion of net sales in fiscal 2003, which increased $812.8 million or 22.2% over net sales of $3.665 billion in fiscal 2002. Approximately 56% of the increase in fiscal 2004 was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, approximately 15% of the increase was attributable to the net sales of CTS (acquired on June 19, 2003) and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2004 of 4.5% was due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. For fiscal 2003, approximately 41% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in BBBs new store sales, approximately 34% of the increase was attributable to the net sales of CTS and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales. Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 48%, 51% and 55% of net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 17%, 16% and 19% of net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 of 52%, 49% and 45%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. The change in the product mix between fiscal 2004 and 2003 and between fiscal 2003 and 2002 is primarily the result of the acquisition of CTS in June 2003. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002. Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $2.186 billion or 42.5% of net sales, $1.877 billion or 41.9% of net sales and $1.519 billion or 41.4% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2004 and 2003 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the reduction of inventory acquisition costs of the Companys current merchandise offerings. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2003 and 2002 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to improvements in both the markup and in markdowns taken. 16 Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1.394 billion or 27.1% of net sales in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.237 billion or 27.6% of net sales in fiscal 2003. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects a relative decrease in payroll and payroll related items, occupancy costs and other expenses, which primarily resulted from the comparable store sales increase. The above relative decreases were partially offset by a relative increase in net advertising costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.6% in fiscal 2003 from 28.3% in fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of a relative decrease in occupancy costs, other store expenses and costs associated with new store openings, partially offset by a relative increase in litigation expense and net advertising costs. SG&A in fiscal 2003 was $1.237 billion as compared to $1.038 billion in fiscal 2002. Operating Profit Operating profit increased to $792.4 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $639.3 million in fiscal 2003. The improvements in operating profit were a result of the increase in net sales and a relative increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and a relative decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as discussed above. Interest income Interest income increased to $18.8 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $10.2 million in fiscal 2003 due to an increase in the cash invested and an increase in the Companys average investment interest rate as a result of the recent upward trend in short term interest rates. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2003 from $11.3 million in fiscal 2002 due to the decrease in the average investment interest rate partially offset by an increase in the cash invested. Income taxes The effective tax rate was 37.75% for fiscal 2004 and 38.50% for fiscal 2003 and 2002. The decrease is due to a reduction in the weighted average effective tax rate resulting from a change in the mix of the business within the taxable jurisdictions in which the Company operates. EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the thirteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2004, the chain has grown from 34 to 660 BBB stores. Total BBB stores square footage grew from 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 21,691,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2004. There were 35 Harmon stores with 240,000 square feet and 26 CTS stores with 1,014,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2004. The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open new BBB, Harmon and CTS stores in fiscal 2005 (see details under Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The Company believes that a predominant portion of any increase in its net sales in fiscal 2005 will continue to be attributable to new store net sales. Accordingly, the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully, of which there can be no assurance. 17 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, through internally generated funds. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2004 was $616.4 million, compared with $548.4 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and the timing of certain liability payments, partially offset by an increase in merchandise inventories (primarily the result of new store space) and the reduction of the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. Inventory per square foot was $50.21 as of February 26, 2005 and $49.45 as of February 28, 2004. The Company continues to focus on optimizing inventory productivity while maintaining appropriate in store merchandise levels to support sales growth. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 was $363.0 million compared with $687.2 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to an increase in redemptions of investment securities and the payment for the acquisition of CTS in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in purchases of investment securities. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2004 was $325.7 million, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $53.4 million in fiscal 2003. The change in net cash resulting from financing activities was primarily attributable to the repurchase of common stock and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. At February 26, 2005, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million and $50 million, with expiration dates of September 3, 2005 and February 28, 2005, respectively. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2004, the Company increased the amount of the $50 million uncommitted line of credit to $75 million and extended the expiration to February 28, 2006. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. It is the Companys intent to maintain an uncommitted line of credit for this purpose. During fiscal 2004, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February 26, 2005, there was approximately $13.4 million of outstanding letters of credit. In addition, under the above uncommitted lines of credit, the Company can obtain unsecured standby letters of credit. As of February 26, 2005, there was approximately $38.1 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs. The Company believes that during fiscal 2005, internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its operations, including its expansion program. The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, purchase obligations and deferred acquisition payments which are payable as of February 26, 2005 as follows: (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Operating Lease Obligations $ 2,983,765 $ 308,698 $ 947,078 $ 551,409 $ 1,176,580 Purchase Obligations 512,369 512,369 Deferred Acquisition Payments 13,334 6,667 6,667 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,509,468 $ 827,734 $ 953,745 $ 551,409 $ 1,176,580 As of February 26, 2005, the Company has leased sites for 69 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2005 or 2006, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $459.8 million and are included in the table above. Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise and capital expenditures. 18 Other significant commitments and contingencies include the following: The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability. Some of the Companys operating lease agreements have scheduled rent increases. The Company accounts for these scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises, thus creating deferred rent. The Company has a non contributory defined benefit pension plan for CTS employees who meet specified age and length of service requirements. The Company intends to make a minimum contribution of approximately $2.3 million during fiscal 2005. SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, November and December and generally lower in February and March. INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R will require companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires additional accounting and disclosure related to income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements. On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the effective date of adoption of SFAS No. 123R to the beginning of the first annual period after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the delayed effective date in determining the timing of adopting SFAS No. 123R. REVISED APPROACH TO COMPENSATION On April 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee made awards to executive officers and other executives reporting to the Companys Chief Executive Officer consisting of a combination of restricted stock and stock option grants. Consistent with past practice, the stock options granted to these executives will vest over time, subject, in general, to the executives remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates. Vesting of the restricted stock awarded to these executives will be dependent on (i) the Companys achievement of a performance based test for the fiscal year of grant, and (ii) assuming achievement of the performance based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates. The Companys other employees who traditionally have received stock option grants have begun to receive awards consisting solely of restricted stock. Vesting of the restricted stock awarded to these employees will be based solely on time vesting with no performance test. The Company will record an expense related to the restricted stock program in fiscal 2005 in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. 19 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the provision for sales returns, inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, income taxes and accruals for self insurance, litigation and store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Sales Returns: Sales returns, which are reserved for based on historical experience, are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded. Although the estimate for sales returns has not varied materially from historical provisions, actual experience could vary from historical experience in the future if the level of sales return activity changes materially. In the future, if the Company concludes that an adjustment to the sales returns accrual is required, the reserve will be adjusted accordingly. Inventory Valuation: Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for CTS is calculated using the first in, first out cost method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Factors considered in estimating realizable value include the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions. The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile. Impairment of Long Lived Assets: The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The Company has not historically had any material impairment of long lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated cash flows generated by the Companys long lived assets to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets: The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. 20 Income Taxes: The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Self Insurance: The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly. Litigation: The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates as appropriate. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings. Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs: Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including estimates for markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which was effective for any exit or disposal activity initiated after December 31, 2002, costs related to store relocations and closings were provided for in the period in which management approved the relocation or closing of a store. Actual costs related to store relocations and closings could differ from these estimates. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10 K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions, changes in the retailing environment and consumer spending habits, demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program; and the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment securities. The Company is adverse to loss of principal and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting market risk. The Companys investment securities consist of fixed rate instruments. The Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of $222.1 million, short term investment securities of $629.3 million and long term investment securities of $324.2 million at weighted average interest rates as of February 26, 2005 of 1.71%, 1.91% and 3.14%, respectively. 21
