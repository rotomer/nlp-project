ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a nationwide chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS) and Harmon. The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware and health and beauty care items. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates. The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices, introduction of new merchandising offerings and development of its infrastructure. Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences and spending habits, general economic conditions, unusual weather patterns, competition from existing and potential competitors, and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program. In fiscal 2005, the Companys consolidated net sales increased by 12.9% and net earnings increased by 13.4%. Contributing to this increase was the expansion of store space by 11.1%, from 22,945,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2004 to 25,502,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2005. The 2,557,000 square feet increase was primarily the result of opening 83 BBB stores, three CTS stores and four Harmon stores. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2005 increased by approximately 4.6% as compared with an increase of approximately 4.5% and 6.3% in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2004, CTS was included in the calculation of comparable store sales. The fiscal 2005 increase in comparable store sales reflected a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced. The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. The Companys fiscal 2006 store opening program is expected to include approximately 80 BBB stores, six CTS stores and the continuing development of its Harmon concept. The Companys new store openings are expected to add approximately 2.5 million square feet of store space. Fiscal 2006 will be a 53 week period ending March 3, 2007. 14 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i) selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii) the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Percentage Change of Net Sales from Prior Year February 25, February 26, February 28, February 25, February 26, 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 12.9 % 15.0 % Cost of sales 57.2 57.5 58.1 12.2 13.8 Gross profit 42.8 42.5 41.9 13.7 16.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 27.7 27.1 27.6 15.3 12.7 Operating profit 15.1 15.4 14.3 10.9 23.9 Earnings before provision for income taxes 15.8 15.8 14.5 12.8 24.9 Net earnings 9.9 9.8 8.9 13.4 26.4 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2005 increased $661.9 million to $5.810 billion, representing an increase of 12.9% over the $5.148 billion of net sales in fiscal 2004, which increased $669.7 million or 15.0% over net sales of $4.478 billion in fiscal 2003. Approximately 64% of the increase in fiscal 2005 was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2005 of 4.6% was due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. For fiscal 2004, approximately 56% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, approximately 15% of the increase was attributable to the net sales of CTS (acquired on June 19, 2003) and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales. Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 47%, 48% and 51% of net sales in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 16%, 17% and 16% of net sales in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 of 53%, 52% and 49%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings and other items. The change in the product mix between fiscal 2004 and 2003 is primarily the result of the acquisition of CTS in June 2003. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003. Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $2.486 billion or 42.8% of net sales, $2.186 billion or 42.5% of net sales and $1.877 billion or 41.9% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2005 and 2004 and between fiscal 2004 and 2003 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to lower inventory acquisition costs of the Companys current merchandise offerings. 15 Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1.607 billion or 27.7% of net sales in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.394 billion or 27.1% of net sales in fiscal 2004. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the expensing of stock options and related changes in the compensation program, reflecting the early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.1% in fiscal 2004 from 27.6% in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of a relative decrease in payroll and payroll related items, occupancy costs and other expenses, which primarily resulted from the comparable store sales increase. These relative decreases were partially offset by a relative increase in net advertising costs. SG&A in fiscal 2004 was $1.394 billion as compared to $1.237 billion in fiscal 2003. Operating Profit Operating profit increased to $879.2 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $792.4 million in fiscal 2004. The improvements in operating profit were a result of the increase in net sales and a relative increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a relative increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as discussed above. Operating profit increased to $792.4 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $639.3 million in fiscal 2003. The improvements in operating profit were a result of the increase in net sales and a relative increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and a relative decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as discussed above. Interest income Interest income increased to $35.9 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $18.8 million in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in the Companys average investment interest rate as a result of the upward trend in short term interest rates. Interest income increased in fiscal 2004 from $10.2 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to an increase in the cash invested and an increase in the Companys average investment interest rate as a result of the upward trend in short term interest rates. Income taxes The effective tax rate was 37.40% for fiscal 2005, 37.75% for fiscal 2004 and 38.50% for fiscal 2003. The decreases are primarily due to a reduction in the weighted average effective tax rate resulting from a change in the mix of the business within the taxable jurisdictions in which the Company operates. For fiscal 2006, the effective tax rate is estimated at approximately 36.60%. EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the fourteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2005, the chain has grown from 34 to 809 stores. Total square footage grew from 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 25,502,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2005. The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open new stores in fiscal 2006 (see details under Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The Company believes that a predominant portion of any increase in its net sales in fiscal 2006 will continue to be attributable to new store net sales. Accordingly, the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully. 16 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, through internally generated funds. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 was $660.4 million, compared with $607.0 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and the timing of certain liability payments, partially offset by an increase in other current assets (primarily due to receivables from the settlement of credit card litigation and hurricane related insurance claims), an increase in merchandise inventories (primarily the result of new store space) and an increase in income taxes paid. Inventory per square foot was $51.04 as of February 25, 2006 and $50.21 as of February 26, 2005. The Company continues to focus on optimizing inventory productivity while maintaining appropriate in store merchandise levels to support sales growth. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 was $67.6 million, compared with $353.7 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to a decrease in purchases of investment securities partially offset by a decrease in redemptions of investment securities and an increase in capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2005 was $567.3 million, compared with $325.7 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to common stock repurchased of $598 million in the current year compared to $350 million in the prior year under the Companys stock repurchase program. At February 25, 2006, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million and $75 million, with expiration dates of September 3, 2006 and February 28, 2006, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under these uncommitted lines of credit, the Company can obtain unsecured standby letters of credit. During fiscal 2005, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February 25, 2006, there was approximately $11.5 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $33.7 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005, the Company extended the $75 million uncommitted line of credit to February 28, 2007. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew the $100 million uncommitted line of credit before the expiration date. The Company believes that during fiscal 2006, internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its operations, including its expansion program. The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, purchase obligations and deferred acquisition payments which the Company is obligated to pay as of February 25, 2006 as follows: Less than 1 After 5 (in thousands) Total year 1 3 years 4 5 years years Operating Lease Obligations $ 3,067,143 $ 340,806 $ 687,529 $ 617,538 $ 1,421,270 Purchase Obligations 415,513 415,513 Deferred Acquisition Payments 6,667 6,667 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,489,323 $ 762,986 $ 687,529 $ 617,538 $ 1,421,270 As of February 25, 2006, the Company has leased sites for 56 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2006 or 2007, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $355.7 million and are included in the table above. 17 Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise and capital expenditures. Other significant commitments and contingencies include the following: The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability. Some of the Companys operating lease agreements have scheduled rent increases. The Company accounts for these scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises, thus creating deferred rent. Subsequent to fiscal 2005, the Company purchased the Union, New Jersey corporate office location. SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, November and December, and generally lower in February and April. INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires additional accounting and disclosure related to income tax and cash flow effects resulting from stock based compensation. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R on August 28, 2005 (the date of adoption), the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal 2005, the year ended February 25, 2006. While SFAS No. 123R is not required to be effective until the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, early adoption was encouraged and the Company elected to adopt before the required effective date. The Company adopted SFAS No.123R under the modified prospective application. Under this application, prior period amounts are not restated to include the effects of stock based compensation. As a result, certain components of the Companys financial statements will not be comparable until the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the anniversary of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The Company will continue to comply with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123R, which include the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as reported and as if compensation expense had been recorded for the comparable periods reported, respectively. The impact of recording stock based compensation expense and other changes made to the Companys overall compensation plan was approximately $0.06 per diluted share for fiscal 2005. The Company estimates the impact will be approximately $0.06 per diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2006. Also under the modified prospective application, the Company records stock based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined under SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company applied the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted under SFAS No. 148, Accounting for 18 Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. During the first half of fiscal 2005, which ended on August 27, 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation expense for stock options, since the options were granted at market value on the date of grant. Stock based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006, which includes the expense of stock options beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and restricted stock awards from the date of grant, was $25.6 million ($16.0 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share). The amount of stock based compensation cost capitalized as of February 25, 2006 was approximately $0.9 million. During fiscal 2004, in anticipation of adopting SFAS No. 123R, the Company revised its overall approach to compensation for its employees, including stock based compensation, and adopted the Bed Bath & Beyond 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan). The 2004 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and performance awards, including cash awards. As a result, during fiscal 2005, awards consisting of a combination of stock options and performance based restricted stock were granted to executive officers and other executives and awards consisting of restricted stock were granted to the Companys other employees who traditionally have received stock options. Awards of stock options and restricted stock generally vest in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Prior to fiscal 2004, the Company had adopted various stock option plans (the Prior Plans), all of which solely provided for the granting of stock options. Upon adoption of the 2004 Plan, the common stock available under the Prior Plans became available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. No further option grants may be made under the Prior Plans, although outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will continue to be in effect. Under the 2004 Plan and the Prior Plans, an aggregate of 83.4 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance. The Company generally issues new shares for stock option exercises and restricted stock awards. The number of shares and the price per share is determined by the Compensation Committee for those awards granted to executive officers and by an appropriate committee for all other awards granted. As of February 25, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Companys stock options and restricted stock awards was $123.1 million and $33.1 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.6 years and 5.2 years, respectively. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP 13 1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense. FSP 13 1 becomes effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of FSP 13 1 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 05 6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination. EITF 05 6 requires leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term to be amortized over the shorter of the assets useful life or a term that includes the original lease term plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. This guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB No. 20 and SFAS No. 3, which changes the requirements for the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No.154 will have a 19 material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN No. 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversions be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 20 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, stock based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Inventory Valuation: Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for CTS is calculated using the first in, first out cost method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions. The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile. Impairment of Long Lived Assets: The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value. The Company has not historically had any material impairment of long lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the fair value of the Companys long lived assets to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets: The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. Self Insurance: The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly. 21 Litigation: The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates, as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the Companys earnings. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings. Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs: Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. Stock Based Compensation: Prior to August 28, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock based compensation plans under the provisions of APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted under SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. During the first half of fiscal 2005, which ended on August 27, 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation expense for stock options, since the options were granted at market value on the date of grant. Effective August 28, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R under the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. Under this application, the Company records stock based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remain unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined under SFAS No. 123R. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company uses a Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected volatility and the expected risk free interest rate. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock based compensation cost, as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123R could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods. Also, under SFAS No. 123R, the Company is required to record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. 22 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10 K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: changes in the retailing environment and consumer preferences and spending habits; demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; general economic conditions; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses; and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program. 23 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment securities. The Company is adverse to loss of principal and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting market risk. The Companys investment securities consist of fixed rate instruments. The Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of $247.7 million, short term investment securities of $404.1 million and long term investment securities of $393.9 million at weighted average interest rates as of February 25, 2006 of 3.07%, 3.02% and 3.88%, respectively.
