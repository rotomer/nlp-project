ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a nationwide chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS) and Harmon. The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware and health and beauty care items. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates. The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices, introduction of new merchandising offerings and development of its infrastructure. Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences and spending habits, general economic conditions, unusual weather patterns, competition from existing and potential competitors, and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program. Net earnings for the fiscal year (fifty three weeks) ended March 3, 2007 were $2.09 per diluted share, including a non recurring charge relating to the Companys remediation program intended to protect its employees from certain potential adverse tax consequences arising pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A of approximately $.07 per diluted share, exceeding fiscal 2005 (fifty two weeks) net earnings of $1.92 per diluted share by approximately 8.9%. Net sales for fiscal 2006 (fifty three weeks) were approximately $6.617 billion, an increase of approximately 13.9% from the prior fiscal year (fifty two weeks). Contributing to this increase was the expansion of store space by 9.0%, from 25.5 million square feet at fiscal year end 2005 to 27.8 million square feet at fiscal year end 2006 and the benefit of an additional week in fiscal 2006. The 2.3 million square feet increase was primarily the result of opening 74 BBB stores, 6 CTS stores and 1 Harmon store. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 increased by approximately 4.9% as compared with an increase of approximately 4.6% and 4.5% in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Comparable store sales percentage increases are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each annual period. As of the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2004, CTS was included in the calculation of comparable store sales. The fiscal 2006 increase in comparable store sales reflected a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced. On March 22, 2007, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2006, the Company completed and announced the acquisition of buybuy BABY, a privately held retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, for approximately $67 million (net of cash acquired) and repayment of debt of approximately $19 million. Based in Garden City, New York, buybuy BABY operates a total of 8 stores in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. The stores range in size from approximately 28,000 to 60,000 square feet and offer a broad assortment of premier infant and toddler merchandise in categories including furniture, car seats, strollers, feeding, bedding, bath, health and safety essentials, toys, learning and development products, clothing and a unique selection of seasonal and holiday products. buybuy BABY was founded in 1996 by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein, both of whom were previously employed by the Company, and are the sons of Leonard Feinstein, one of the Companys Co Chairmen. The acquisition was 14 approved by a special committee of independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The special committee retained Merrill Lynch & Co. to serve as its independent financial advisor and render a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction, as well as Chadbourne & Parke LLP to serve as independent legal counsel to oversee the acquisition negotiations. The aforementioned repayment of approximately $19 million of debt results in the retirement of all indebtedness of buybuy BABY, which debt was held by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein (approximately $16 million) and Leonard Feinstein (approximately $3 million). The Companys Co Chairmen, Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, recused themselves from deliberations relating to the transaction. The acquisition of buybuy BABY had no effect on the Companys fiscal 2006 results since the transaction occurred during fiscal 2007. The Company believes the benefit of this acquisition will not have a material effect on the overall results or financial condition of the Company for fiscal 2007. The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. The Companys fiscal 2007 store opening program is expected to focus primarily on new BBB stores. The Company also plans to improve and grow its CTS, Harmon and buybuy BABY concepts. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i) selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii) the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Percentage Change of Net Sales from Prior Year March 3, February 25, February 26, March 3, February 25, 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 13.9 % 12.9 % Cost of sales 57.2 57.2 57.5 13.8 12.2 Gross profit 42.8 42.8 42.5 14.1 13.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 29.4 27.7 27.1 21.1 15.3 Operating profit 13.4 15.1 15.4 1.2 10.9 Earnings before provision for income taxes 14.1 15.8 15.8 1.9 12.8 Net earnings 9.0 9.9 9.8 3.7 13.4 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2006 (fifty three weeks) increased $807.9 million to $6.617 billion, representing an increase of 13.9% over the $5.810 billion of net sales in fiscal 2005 (fifty two weeks), which increased $661.9 million or 12.9% over net sales of $5.148 billion in fiscal 2004. Approximately 52% of the increase in fiscal 2006 was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales and the benefit of an additional week in fiscal 2006. The additional week of sales in fiscal 2006 represented approximately 1.6% of net sales. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 of 4.9% was due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. Comparable store sales percentage increases are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each annual period. For fiscal 2005, approximately 64% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales. 15 Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 46%, 47% and 48% of net sales in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 15%, 16% and 17% of net sales in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 of 54%, 53% and 52%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings and other items. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $2.835 billion or 42.8% of net sales, $2.486 billion or 42.8% of net sales and $2.186 billion or 42.5% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2005 and 2004 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to lower inventory acquisition costs of the Companys current merchandise offerings. Selling, General and Administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1.946 billion or 29.4% of net sales in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.607 billion or 27.7% of net sales in fiscal 2005. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to a non recurring charge relating to the Companys remediation program intended to protect its employees from certain potential adverse tax consequences arising pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, the expensing of stock options for twelve months in fiscal 2006 versus six months in fiscal 2005, additional stock based compensation charges primarily related to the revised measurement dates, increased legal and accounting charges associated with the stock option review (see Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters) and an increase in advertising, which includes higher paper costs and postal rates. Lastly, there were one time benefits experienced in fiscal 2005, such as settlement of credit card litigation and certain insurance recoveries, which the Company did not have in fiscal 2006. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 27.7% in fiscal 2005 from 27.1% in fiscal 2004, primarily due to the expensing of stock options and related changes in the compensation program reflecting the early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SG&A in fiscal 2005 was $1.607 billion as compared to $1.394 billion in fiscal 2004. Interest Income Interest income in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $43.5 million, $35.9 million and $18.8 million, respectively. Interest income increased primarily due to increases in the Companys average investment interest rates as a result of the upward trend in short term interest rates. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 36.30% for fiscal 2006, 37.40% for fiscal 2005 and 37.75% for fiscal 2004. The decreases are primarily due to a reduction in the weighted average effective tax rate resulting from a change in the mix of the business within the taxable jurisdictions in which the Company operates. For fiscal 2007, the effective tax rate is estimated at approximately 36.30%. EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. The Company also continues to actively explore international expansion (including Canada). In the fifteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2006, the chain has grown from 34 to 888 stores. Total square footage grew from 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 27.8 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2006. 16 The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open primarily new BBB stores in fiscal 2007. The Company also plans to continue to improve and grow its CTS, Harmon and buybuy BABY concepts in fiscal 2007 (see details under Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, through internally generated funds. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006 was $613.6 million, compared with $660.4 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was principally driven by working capital changes due to the increase in merchandise inventories (primarily as a result of new store space) and an increase in other current assets (due to the timing of prepayments), partially offset by an increase in net earnings and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities (primarily due to the timing of payments). Inventory per square foot was $54.18 as of March 3, 2007 and $51.04 as of February 25, 2006. The Company continues to focus on optimizing inventory productivity while maintaining appropriate in store merchandise levels to support sales growth. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 was $397.7 million, compared with $67.6 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to a decrease in redemptions of investment securities and an increase in capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease in purchases of investment securities. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2006 was $250.3 million, compared with $567.3 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to common stock repurchased of $301 million in the current year compared to $598 million in the prior year under the Companys stock repurchase program. At March 3, 2007, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million and $75 million, with expiration dates of September 3, 2007 and February 28, 2008, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under these uncommitted lines of credit, the Company can obtain unsecured standby letters of credit. During fiscal 2006, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of March 3, 2007, there was approximately $6.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $40.0 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. The Company believes that during fiscal 2007, internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its operations, including its expansion program. The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, and purchase obligations which the Company is obligated to pay as of March 3, 2007 as follows: Less than 1 After 5 (in thousands) Total year 1 3 years 4 5 years years Operating Lease Obligations $3,195,864 $ 372,168 $ 743,317 $ 644,898 $ 1,435,481 Purchase Obligations 415,727 415,727 Total Contractual Obligations $3,611,591 $ 787,895 $ 743,317 $ 644,898 $ 1,435,481 As of March 3, 2007, the Company has leased sites for 58 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2007 or 2008, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $325.0 million and are 17 included in the table above. Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise and capital expenditures. Other significant commitments and contingencies include the following: The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability. Some of the Companys operating lease agreements have scheduled rent increases. The Company accounts for these scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises, thus creating deferred rent. SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, November and December, and generally lower in February and April. INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. The transition provisions of SAB 108 permit the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect on retained earnings of immaterial errors relating to prior years. SAB 108 also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next presented. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the SEC to be amended. The Company adopted SAB 108 at the end of fiscal 2006. In accordance with SAB 108, the Company has adjusted beginning retained earnings for fiscal 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the items described under Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters and Rent and Lease Accounting below. The Company considers these adjustments to be immaterial to prior periods. Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters In June 2006, the Companys Board of Directors appointed a special committee of two independent members of the Board of Directors, with authority, among other things, to conduct an investigation with respect to the setting of exercise prices for employee stock options and related matters as the special committee deemed appropriate. The special committee retained independent counsel who engaged outside accounting advisors to assist with the review. This review was completed and on October 9, 2006, the special committee presented its report to the Companys Board of Directors. The review of stock option grants and procedures identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares described below. As a result of the deficiencies, the special committee recommended, among other things, that the Company revise the measurement dates under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, for 16 annual option grant dates, 26 monthly grant dates and 2 special grant dates (revisions of 2 annual, 4 monthly and 1 special grant dates have 18 no accounting impact because prices on the revised dates were lower than on the measurement dates previously recorded by the Company). As a result of these revised measurement dates and the correction of various other errors relating to the accounting for equity based compensation, the Company has determined that from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal 2005, it had certain unrecorded non cash equity based compensation charges associated with its equity based compensation plans. The Company filed a Form 8 K dated October 10, 2006, which provides further details regarding the special committees review. As a result, the Company has recorded an adjustment for unrecorded expense over the affected period (fiscal year 1993 through 2005) of $61.8 million, including related tax items. In accordance with the provisions of SAB 108, the Company decreased beginning retained earnings for fiscal year 2006 by $61.8 million within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not believe that the net effect of this adjustment was material, either quantitatively or qualitatively, in any of the years covered by the review. In reaching that determination, the following quantitative measures were considered: (in thousands) Net Adjustment, After Net Adjustment, Net Income Tax as a % of Net Fiscal Year After Tax As Reported Income As Reported 2005 $ 11,488 $ 572,847 2.01 % 2004 12,493 504,964 2.47 % 2003 13,607 399,470 3.41 % 2002 8,600 302,179 2.85 % 2001 7,391 219,599 3.37 % 2000 5,272 171,922 3.07 % 1999 1,340 131,229 1.02 % 1998 923 97,346 0.95 % 1997 405 73,142 0.55 % 1996 163 55,015 0.30 % 1995 56 39,459 0.14 % 1994 22 30,013 0.07 % 1993 2 21,887 0.01 % Total $ 61,762 Rent and Lease Accounting The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. In fiscal 2004, due to clarification by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC, the Company changed its method of accounting to define the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises. Prior to fiscal 2004, the Companys method of accounting defined the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company commenced lease payments. The Company has recorded an adjustment to retained earnings and deferred rent and other liabilities to reflect these accounts as if the Company had always defined the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises and to correspondingly increase deferred tax assets. The Company does not believe that the net effect of this adjustment which includes fiscal years 1993 through 2003 was material. Impact of Adjustments The impact of each of the items noted above, net of tax, on fiscal 2006 beginning balances are presented below: 19 Review of Stock Option Grant Rent & Practices, Including Lease (in thousands) Related Tax Items Accounting Total Other Assets $ 11,273 $ 4,738 $ 16,011 Income Taxes Payable (34,747 ) (34,747 ) Deferred Rent and Other Liabilities (15,588 ) (15,588 ) Additional Paid in Capital (38,288 ) (38,288 ) Retained Earnings 61,762 10,850 72,612 Total $ $ $ Other Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires additional accounting and disclosure related to income tax and cash flow effects resulting from stock based compensation. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R on August 28, 2005 (the date of adoption), the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal 2005, the year ended February 25, 2006. While SFAS No. 123R was not required to be effective until the first annual reporting period that began after June 15, 2005, early adoption was encouraged and the Company elected to adopt before the required effective date. The Company adopted SFAS No.123R under the modified prospective application. Under this application, prior period amounts are not restated to include the effects of stock based compensation, and the Company records stock based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined under SFAS No. 123R. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (the fair value option). If the fair value option is elected, any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, e.g. debt issue costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and may generally be made on an instrument by instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur. As required by SFAS No. 158, the Company adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions at the end of fiscal 2006 on a prospective basis and will adopt the year end measurement date in fiscal 2008. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. (See Employee Benefit Plans, Note 9). In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not believe the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 20 In June 2006, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation). The scope of EITF 06 3 includes sales, use, value added and some excise taxes that are assessed by a governmental authority on specific revenue producing transactions between a seller and customer. EITF 06 3 requires disclosure of the method of accounting for the applicable assessed taxes and the amount of assessed taxes that are included in revenues if they are accounted for under the gross method. EITF 06 3 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2006. EITF 06 3 will not impact the method for recording these taxes in the Companys consolidated financial statements as the Company historically has presented sales excluding these taxes. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP 13 1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense. FSP 13 1 was effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FSP 13 1 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. REVIEW OF EQUITY GRANTS AND PROCEDURES AND RELATED MATTERS As a result of revised measurement dates for certain stock option grants, and the correction of various other errors, the Company has determined that it had certain unrecorded non cash equity based compensation charges related to fiscal years prior to 2006. (See Recent Accounting Pronouncements Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108). For fiscal 2006, the Company recorded $8.2 million of expense related to the revised measurement dates. The Companys Board of Directors also approved a remediation program intended to protect over 1,600 employees from certain potential adverse tax consequences. These adverse tax consequences arise pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A as a result of historical deficiencies associated with certain of the Companys stock option grants that were disclosed through the Companys stock option review. As a result of this program, the Company made cash payments totaling approximately $30.0 million to over 1,600 employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, which resulted in a non recurring, pre tax stock based compensation charge. The cash outlay primarily represents payments to employees in connection with increasing the exercise prices on certain stock option grants so as to protect them from certain potential adverse tax consequences. No executive officer received such payments. The Company believes it is likely the Company will recoup a substantial portion of the anticipated cash outlay over the next several years through higher proceeds from future stock option exercises, although this recovery would not flow through the income statement. The Company also filed a Form 8 K dated December 28, 2006 which provides further details regarding the remediation program. The Company continues to cooperate with the informal inquiry of the SEC regarding the Companys stock option grant practices. In addition, the Company is also cooperating with the United States Attorneys office for the District of New Jersey in connection with its inquiry into such matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, stock based 21 compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Inventory Valuation: Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for CTS is calculated using the first in, first out cost method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions. The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile. Impairment of Long Lived Assets: The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets: The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. Self Insurance: The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly. Litigation: The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates, as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the Companys earnings. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings. Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs: Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, 22 including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. Stock Based Compensation: Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company uses a Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected volatility and the expected risk free interest rate. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock based compensation cost, as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123R could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods. The Company is required to record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
