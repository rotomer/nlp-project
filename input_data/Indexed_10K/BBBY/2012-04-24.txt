ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY. In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More. The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates. The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices and introduction of new merchandising offerings, supported by the continuous development and improvement of its infrastructure. Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions including the housing market, the overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment, consumer preferences and spending habits, unusual weather patterns and natural disasters, competition from existing and potential competitors, and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program. The Company continues to face a number of economic challenges impacting consumer confidence and spending, including relatively high unemployment and commodity prices and a sluggish housing market. The Company cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which these economic conditions will change. The Company remains committed to making the required investments in its infrastructure to help position the Company for continued success. The Company continues to review and prioritize its capital needs while continuing to make investments, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements including increased spending on its interactive platforms, and other projects whose impact is considered important to its future. The following represents an overview of the Companys financial performance for the periods indicated: Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased approximately 8.5% to $9.500 billion; net sales in fiscal 2010 increased approximately 11.9% to $8.759 billion over net sales of $7.829 billion in fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2011 increased by approximately 5.9% as compared with an increase of approximately 7.8% in fiscal 2010 and an increase of approximately 4.4% in fiscal 2009. A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced. Gross profit for fiscal 2011 was $3.931 billion or 41.4% of net sales compared with $3.623 billion or 41.4% of net sales for fiscal 2010 and $3.208 billion or 41.0% of net sales for fiscal 2009. 16 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for fiscal 2011 were $2.363 billion or 24.9% of net sales compared with $2.334 billion or 26.7% of net sales for fiscal 2010 and $2.227 billion or 28.5% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate was 37.0%, 38.8% and 39.1% for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The tax rate included discrete tax items of an approximate $20.7 million net benefit, $0.9 million net expense and $3.2 million net expense, respectively, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. For the fiscal year ended February 25, 2012, net earnings per diluted share were $4.06 ($989.5 million), an increase of approximately 32%, as compared with net earnings per diluted share of $3.07 ($791.3 million) for fiscal 2010, which was an increase of approximately 33% from net earnings per diluted share of $2.30 ($600.0 million) for fiscal 2009. For fiscal year ended February 25, 2012, the increase in net earnings per diluted share is the result of the items described above, as well as the impact of the Companys repurchases of its common stock. For the fiscal year ended February 26, 2011, the increase in net earnings per diluted share primarily reflects the favorable movements in gross profit and SG&A expenses. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Companys capital expenditures were $243.4 million, $183.5 million and $153.7 million, respectively. In addition, during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company repurchased 21.5 million, 15.9 million and 2.7 million shares, respectively, of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $1.218 billion, $687.6 million and $94.9 million, respectively. The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. In fiscal 2012, the Company expects to open approximately 40 new stores across all concepts. During fiscal 2011, the Company opened a total of 38 new stores, including 13 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, five CTS stores, one Harmon store and 19 buybuy BABY stores, and closed two BBB stores and two Harmon stores. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i) selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii) the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Percentage Change of Net Sales from Prior Year February 25, February 26, February 27, February 25, February 26, 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 8.5 % 11.9 % Cost of sales 58.6 58.6 59.0 8.4 11.1 Gross profit 41.4 41.4 41.0 8.5 12.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 24.9 26.7 28.5 1.2 4.8 Operating profit 16.5 14.7 12.5 21.7 31.4 Earnings before provision for income taxes 16.5 14.8 12.6 21.4 31.2 Net earnings 10.4 9.0 7.7 25.0 31.9 17 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased $741.4 million to $9.500 billion, representing an increase of 8.5% over $8.759 billion of net sales in fiscal 2010, which increased $929.7 million or 11.9% over the $7.829 billion of net sales in fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2011, approximately 68.6% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys comparable store sales and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales. For fiscal 2010, approximately 65.2% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys comparable store sales and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales. For fiscal 2011, comparable store sales for 1,076 stores represented $9.157 billion of net sales; for fiscal 2010, comparable store sales for 1,013 stores represented $8.339 billion of net sales; and for fiscal 2009, comparable store sales for 942 stores represented $7.409 billion of net sales. Comparable store sales increased by approximately 5.9% for fiscal 2011 and increased by approximately 7.8% for fiscal 2010. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2011 was due to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount. Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 40%, 41% and 41% of net sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 12%, 12% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 of 60%, 59% and 59%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $3.931 billion or 41.4% of net sales, $3.623 billion or 41.4% of net sales and $3.208 billion or 41.0% of net sales, respectively. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011 included a reduction in markdowns, offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2010 and 2009 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in coupon expense as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. Selling, General and Administrative expenses SG&A was $2.363 billion or 24.9% of net sales in fiscal 2011, $2.334 billion or 26.7% of net sales in fiscal 2010 and $2.227 billion or 28.5% of net sales in fiscal 2009. The decrease in SG&A between fiscal 2011 and 2010 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to relative decreases in payroll and payroll related items (including salaries and medical insurance), occupancy (including rent and depreciation), advertising and store expenses, all of which benefited from the increase in comparable store sales. In addition, advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. The decrease in SG&A between fiscal 2010 and 2009 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to relative decreases in payroll and occupancy expenses, as well as a relative decrease in advertising expenses resulting from a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Payroll and occupancy (including rent and depreciation) expense benefited from the approximate 7.8% increase in comparable store sales. Operating Profit Operating profit for fiscal 2011 was $1.568 billion or 16.5% of net sales, $1.288 billion or 14.7% of net sales in fiscal 2010 and $980.7 million or 12.5% of net sales in fiscal 2009. The change in operating profit as a percentage of net sales between fiscal 2011 and 2010 was the result of the change in SG&A as a percentage of net sales as described above. The change in operating profit between fiscal 2010 and 2009 was a result of the changes in the gross profit margin and SG&A as a percentage of net sales as described above. Interest Income Interest income was $1.1 million, $4.5 million and $4.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 18 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 37.0% for fiscal 2011, 38.8% for fiscal 2010 and 39.1% for fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2011, the tax rate included an approximate $20.7 million net benefit primarily due to the settlement of certain discrete tax items from on going examinations, the recognition of favorable discrete state tax items and from changing the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. For fiscal 2010, the tax rate included an approximate $0.9 million net expense primarily due to the recognition of certain discrete tax items, partially offset by the changing of the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. For fiscal 2009, the tax rate included an approximate $3.2 million net expense primarily due to the recognition of certain discrete tax items partially offset by the changing of the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. The remaining increase in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to slightly higher state taxes. The Company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit. EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the 20 year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2011, the chain has grown from 34 to 1,173 stores. Total square footage grew from 0.9 million square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 36.1 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, the Company opened a total of 38 new stores, including 13 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, five CTS stores, one Harmon store and 19 buybuy BABY stores, and closed two BBB stores and two Harmon stores, all of which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 1.1 million square feet of store space. In May 2008, the Company became a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More. The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. In fiscal 2012, the Company expects to open approximately 40 new stores across all concepts. In order to further improve the communication, collaboration, coordination and execution across all concepts, activities and platforms, the Company plans to incur costs to relocate its offices from Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to its Union, New Jersey corporate headquarters buildings. The relocation is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the summer of fiscal 2012. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, entirely through internally generated funds. For fiscal 2012, the Company believes that it will continue to finance its operations, including its expansion program, share repurchase program and planned capital expenditures, entirely through existing and internally generated funds. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2012, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, and information technology enhancements, including increased spending on interactive platforms, and other projects are planned to be in the range of approximately $275.0 million to $325.0 million, subject to the timing and composition of the projects. Capital expenditures include the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website; an additional 800,000 square foot E Service fulfillment center in Georgia; the relocation of the Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to the Companys corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey; and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support the Companys ongoing technology initiatives. Fiscal 2011 compared to Fiscal 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was $1.225 billion, compared with $987.4 million in fiscal 2010. Year over year, the Company experienced an increase in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in cash used for the net components of working capital (primarily accounts payable and income taxes payable, partially offset by merchandise inventories). 19 Table of Contents Inventory per square foot was $57.35 as of February 25, 2012, as compared to $56.17 as of February 26, 2011. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2011 was $364.0 million, compared with $341.0 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, net cash used in investing activities was due to $243.4 million of capital expenditures and $120.6 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions. In fiscal 2010, net cash used in investing activities was due to $157.5 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions, and $183.5 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2011 was $1.042 billion, compared with $559.0 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net cash used was primarily due to a $530.4 million increase in common stock repurchases partially offset by a $45.4 million increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Fiscal 2010 compared to Fiscal 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was $987.4 million, compared with $905.4 million in fiscal 2009. Year over year, the Company experienced an increase in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in cash used for the net components of working capital (primarily merchandise inventories and income taxes payable, partially offset by deferred rent and other liabilities). Inventory per square foot was $56.17 as of February 26, 2011, as compared to $52.15 as of February 27, 2010. This increase of approximately 7.7% was primarily due to increased inventory levels required to support recent increases in comparable store sales and the timing of merchandise receipts. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 was $341.0 million, compared with $488.7 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, net cash used in investing activities was due to $157.5 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions, and $183.5 million of capital expenditures. In fiscal 2009, net cash used in investing activities was due to $335.0 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions, and $153.7 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 was $559.0 million, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $11.2 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net cash used was primarily due to a $592.7 million increase in common stock repurchases partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Auction Rate Securities As of February 25, 2012, the Company held approximately $80.2 million of net investments in auction rate securities. Beginning in mid February 2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. As of February 25, 2012, these securities had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2011. As of February 25, 2012, the Company classified approximately $6.5 million of these securities as short term investment securities due to expected redemptions at par during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, approximately $29.0 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2011 through April 13, 2012, the Company redeemed approximately $6.5 million at par. 20 Table of Contents The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program, share repurchase program, and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will remain primarily classified as non current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly. Other Fiscal 2011 Information At February 25, 2012, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million each, with expiration dates of February 29, 2012 and September 2, 2012, respectively. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2011, the expiration date on the line of credit that would have otherwise expired on February 29, 2012 was extended to February 28, 2013. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2011, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February 25, 2012, there was approximately $8.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. In addition, as of February 25, 2012, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $61.3 million, primarily for certain insurance programs. Between December 2004 and December 2010, the Companys Board of Directors authorized, through several share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $4.950 billion of the Companys common stock. Since 2004 through the end of fiscal 2011, the Company has repurchased approximately $4.0 billion of its common stock through several share repurchase programs. The Company has approximately $919 million remaining of authorized share repurchases as of February 25, 2012. The execution of the Companys share repurchase program will consider current business and market conditions. The Company has authorization to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rules and regulations. The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, purchase obligations and other long term liabilities which the Company is obligated to pay as of February 25, 2012 as follows: 21 Table of Contents (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Operating Lease Obligations (1) $ 3,038,397 $ 466,029 $ 827,065 $ 651,050 $ 1,094,253 Purchase Obligations (2) 751,973 751,973 Other long term liabilities (3) 462,888 Total Contractual Obligations $ 4,253,258 $ 1,218,002 $ 827,065 $ 651,050 $ 1,094,253 (1) The amounts presented represent the future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases. In addition to minimum rent, certain of the Companys leases require the payment of additional costs for insurance, maintenance and other costs. These additional amounts are not included in the table of contractual commitments as the timing and or amounts of such payments are not known. As of February 25, 2012, the Company has leased sites for 26 locations planned for opening in fiscal 2012 or 2013, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $106.3 million and are included in the table above. (2) Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise. (3) Amounts recorded as deferred rent and other liabilities and income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 25, 2012 have been reflected only in the Total column in the table above as the timing and or amount of any cash payment is uncertain. Deferred rent and other liabilities are primarily comprised of deferred rent, workers compensation and general liability reserves and various other accruals. SEASONALITY The Companys sales exhibit seasonality with sales levels generally higher in the calendar months of August, November and December, and generally lower in February. INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, stock based compensation and income and certain other taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Inventory Valuation: Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB, buybuy BABY and Harmon are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method and inventory costs for CTS are calculated using the first in first out cost method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost to retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions. 22 Table of Contents At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions. The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted. For locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year, an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile. The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories. Impairment of Long Lived Assets: The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long lived asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these long lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets: The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that, as of February 25, 2012, no impairment existed because the fair value of these assets substantially exceeded their carrying values. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. Self Insurance: The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly. Litigation: The Company records an estimated liability related to its various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business when and to the extent that it concludes a liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimated loss is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to claims and legal actions and revises its estimated liabilities, as appropriate. The Company expects the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company also cannot predict the nature and validity 23 Table of Contents of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings. Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs: Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. Stock Based Compensation: The Company uses a Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected risk free interest rate and the expected volatility. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock based compensation cost could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods. The Company determines its assumptions for the Black Scholes option pricing model in accordance with the accounting guidance related to stock compensation. The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience. The expected risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on the average of historical and implied volatility. The historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the Companys call options, which are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date. The Company is required to record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates. Taxes: The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., in most cases such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities. The Company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit. The Company also accrues for certain other taxes as required by their operations. 24 Table of Contents Judgment is required in determining the provision for income and other taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys various tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10 K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions including the housing market, a challenging overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment, consumer preferences and spending habits; demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; civil disturbances and terrorist attacks; unusual weather patterns and natural disasters; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of the organization; the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs and other terms to support the Companys expansion program; the impact of failed auctions for auction rate securities held by the Company; uncertainty in financial markets; disruptions to the Companys information technology systems including but not limited to security breaches of the Companys systems protecting consumer and employee information; reputational risk arising from the acts of third parties; changes to statutory, regulatory and legal requirements; changes to, or new, tax laws or interpretation of existing tax laws; and changes to, or new, accounting standards including, without limitation, changes to lease accounting standards. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update its forward looking statements. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of February 25, 2012, the Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.003 billion, short term investment securities of approximately $756.4 million and long term investment securities of approximately $95.8 million at weighted average interest rates of 0.00%, 0.04% and 0.24%, respectively. As of February 25, 2012, the Company held approximately $80.2 million of net investments in auction rate securities. Beginning in mid February 2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. As of February 25, 2012, these securities had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2011. As of February 25, 2012, the Company classified approximately $6.5 million of these securities as short term investment securities due to expected redemptions at par during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, approximately $29.0 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2011 through April 13, 2012, the Company redeemed approximately $6.5 million at par. The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These 25 Table of Contents investments will remain primarily classified as non current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly. 26 Table of Contents
