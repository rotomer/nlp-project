Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe transparency and understandability are the primary goals of successful financial reporting. We remain committed to increasing the transparency of our financial reporting, providing our shareholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial position and operating results. In accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that such controls were effective as of February 25, 2006. Our independent registered public accounting firm expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Managements report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and the related report of our independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in eight sections: Overview Strategic Initiatives Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards Outlook for Fiscal 2007 We believe our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. On June 23, 2005, our Board approved a three for two stock split. Shareholders of record as of July 13, 2005, received one additional share for every two shares owned, with fractional shares being redeemed for cash. The additional shares were distributed on August 3, 2005. All share and per share information herein reflect this stock split. Unless otherwise noted, this MD&A relates only to results from continuing operations. All periods presented reflect the classification of Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations. Overview Best Buy Co., Inc. is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations of U.S. Best Buy, Magnolia Audio Video and U.S. Geek Squad. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, operating 742 stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia at the end of fiscal 2006. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high end audio and video products and services from 20 stores located in California, Washington and Oregon at the end of fiscal 2006. U.S. Geek Squad offers computer repair, support and installation services in all U.S. Best Buy stores and 12 stand alone stores at the end of fiscal 2006. Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, Inc. (Pacific Sales), which we acquired in March 2006, will be included in the Domestic segment starting in fiscal 2007. The International segment was established in connection with our acquisition of Future Shop in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. At the end of fiscal 2006, the International segment consisted of 118 Future Shop stores operating throughout all Canadian provinces, and 44 Canadian Best Buy stores operating in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In addition, Canadian Geek Squad offers computer repair, support and installation services in all Canadian Best Buy stores and in 27 five stand alone stores at the end of fiscal 2006. The International segment offers products and services similar to those offered by the Domestic segment, although Canadian Best Buy stores do not sell appliances. In support of our retail store operations, we also operate Web sites for each of our brands (BestBuy.com, BestBuyCanada.ca, FutureShop.ca, MagnoliaAV.com, GeekSquad.com, GeekSquad.ca and PacificSales.com). Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season, than in any other fiscal quarter. The timing of new store openings, costs associated with the development of new businesses, as well as general economic conditions may also affect our future quarterly results. Financial Reporting Changes On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (123(R)), effective for a companys first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all stock based compensation, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we early adopted SFAS No. 123(R), and elected the modified prospective transition method. This method permits us to apply the new requirements on a prospective basis. Our selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) rate for fiscal 2006 included an increase in stock based compensation expense of $133 million ($88 million net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share), which increased our SG&A rate by approximately 0.4% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year. For additional information on our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we reclassified variable rate demand notes from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported total assets or net earnings. For additional information regarding our variable rate demand notes, refer to Note 3, Investments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Strategic Initiatives Our vision is to make life fun and easy for consumers. Our business strategy is to treat each customer as a unique individual, meeting their needs with end to end solutions, and engaging and energizing our employees to serve them, while maximizing overall profitability. During fiscal 2006, our primary strategic initiative was accelerating our transformation to a customer centric organization. Customer centricity contributed to our strong growth during fiscal 2006 and is expected to provide the framework to grow and further enhance our business in the future. Customer Centricity Our customers are at the core of all of our business strategies. Customer centricity has moved beyond an initiative and is now how we do business. Customer centricity means treating each customer as a unique individual, meeting their needs with end to end solutions, and engaging and energizing our employees to serve them. Mass merchants, direct sellers, other specialty retailers and online retailers are increasingly interested in our product categories because of rising demand. If we can understand our customers better than our competitors do, and if we can inspire our employees to have richer interactions with customers, then we can more effectively compete. Customer centricity has been, and will continue to be, a growth driver for us. Accelerating Our Transformation In fiscal 2006 we implemented five key strategies to accelerate our customer centricity initiative. First, we converted or opened a record number of stores with the customer centric operating model, finishing the 28 fiscal year with 300 customer centricity stores, or 40% of U.S. Best Buy stores. Second, we expanded and strengthened our services offering by adding 5,000 Geek Squad agents. In addition, we brought our previously outsourced home theater installation services in house to serve our customers better. Third, we expanded individualized marketing capabilities through our Reward Zone customer loyalty program. Memberships in Reward Zone increased approximately 50% to more than seven million members and gained key insights about customer purchase patterns. Fourth, because customer centricity relies on employees engaging with customers in new ways, we focused on increasing employee retention. During the fiscal year we changed how we manage our people, made more extensive use of strengths based tools and created an incentive system in which all store employees could be effectively rewarded. Our efforts reduced store employee turnover by 15% compared with the previous fiscal year. Fifth, we embarked on a three year plan to re engineer our supply chain and information technology systems. This work is aimed at streamlining our processes in order to improve the customer experience in important areas such as product in stock levels. Initial results are promising our systems are faster, cost less and have the flexibility to adjust as we transform the customer experience. Profitably Scaling Customer Centricity Scaling and refining our customer centric operating model remains our primary strategy for fiscal 2007. Customer centricity allows us to better serve the unmet needs of consumers and develop new growth channels. During fiscal 2007, we are committed to scaling the model profitably across U.S. Best Buy. We have set six priorities for fiscal 2007 that support our transformation to a customer centric company. One, we plan to implement a single, customer centric operating model at our corporate campus by the end of fiscal 2007. Moving to a single operating model will eliminate redundant work and unify the organization. We also will divest resources in mature areas so we can invest resources in growth areas, such as small businesses, services and home theater. Two, we will continue to grow organically. We plan to open approximately 90 new stores in North America. We also anticipate opening 200 more Magnolia Home Theaters inside U.S. Best Buy stores, taking advantage of rising consumer interest in flat panel TVs. Three, we plan to build our small business capabilities. This priority includes increasing our Best Buy For Business locations to more than 200 stores and training more than 900 Microsoft certified professionals by year end. Four, we expect to grow our services business by driving productivity improvements in computer services and home theater installation. We also plan to drive gains through the implementation of new tools, the benefits of scale and a market based approach to home visits. Five, we plan to enhance our ability to provide complete solutions to customers by giving our employees better tools and capabilities for describing, demonstrating and selling solutions such as digital music subscriptions, digital cable and voice over Internet telephony. Six, we plan to pursue international growth opportunities. Specifically, we anticipate leveraging our investments in Canada, where we operate both Future Shop and Best Buy stores, while we embark on a controlled growth strategy in China. Our company priorities are aimed at refining this model and investing in the capabilities and customer experiences that will drive long term profitable growth. Results of Operations Fiscal 2006 Summary Earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 increased 22% to $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared with $934 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, for fiscal 2005. The increase was driven by revenue growth, including a comparable store sales gain of 4.9%, and an increase in our gross profit rate, and 29 was partially offset by an increase in our SG&A rate. In addition, earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 benefited from net interest income of $77 million, compared with net interest income of $1 million for the prior fiscal year, and a lower effective income tax rate. Net earnings for fiscal 2006 reflect the impact of early adopting SFAS No. 123(R), which resulted in an increase in stock based compensation expense of $132 million ($87 million net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share). In addition, net earnings for fiscal 2006 included income of $43 million ($29 million net of tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage (gift cards sold where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote). Gift card breakage income was not recorded in fiscal 2005 or prior years. Revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 12% to $30.8 billion. The increase reflected market share gains and was driven by the net addition of 103 new stores during fiscal 2006, a full year of revenue from stores added in fiscal 2005 and the 4.9% comparable store sales increase. The remainder of the increase was due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our gross profit rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 25.0% of revenue. The increase was driven by the continued transformation of our supply chain, which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs, more effective pricing strategies, and increased sales of higher margin services and private label products. We also benefited from better product transition management and a more stable promotional environment. Our SG&A rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 19.7% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to increased performance based incentive compensation resulting from our strong financial performance, a growing number of stores operating under the higher cost customer centric labor model and costs associated with supporting our services business, and was partially offset by expense leverage resulting from a higher revenue base. The change in our accounting for stock based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.4% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2006, we opened 70 U.S. Best Buy stores and converted 163 existing U.S. Best Buy stores with the customer centric operating model (segmented stores). At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 300 segmented stores, or 40% of total U.S. Best Buy stores. Effective with the cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9 percent, to $0.08 per common share. During fiscal 2006, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.31 per common share, or $151 million in the aggregate. During fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 18.3 million shares at a cost of $772 million pursuant to our share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2006, we and the Best Buy Childrens Foundation contributed approximately $30 million to local communities, including contributions for the communities and people affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita. 30 Consolidated Results The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Consolidated Performance Summary 2006 2005 (1) 2004 Revenue $ 30,848 $ 27,433 $ 24,548 Total revenue gain % 12 % 12 % 17 % Comparable stores sales % gain(2) 4.9 % 4.3 % 7.1 % Gross profit as % of revenue 25.0 % 23.7 % 23.9 % SG&A as % of revenue 19.7 % 18.4 % 18.6 % Operating income $ 1,644 $ 1,442 $ 1,304 Operating income as % of revenue 5.3 % 5.3 % 5.3 % Earnings from continuing operations $ 1,140 $ 934 $ 800 Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ $ 50 $ (95 ) Net earnings $ 1,140 $ 984 $ 705 Diluted earnings per share continuing operations $ 2.27 $ 1.86 $ 1.61 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.27 $ 1.96 $ 1.42 Note: All periods presented reflect the classification of Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations. (1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, following a review of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a cumulative pre tax charge of $36 ($23 net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) to correct our accounting for certain operating lease matters. Additionally, we established a sales return liability which reduced revenue by $65 and gross profit by $15 ($10 net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share). Finally, based on the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland, we recorded a $50 tax benefit. The tax benefit is included in gain (loss) from discontinued operations. (2) Comprised of revenue at stores and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Continuing Operations Fiscal 2006 Results Compared With Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2006 earnings from continuing operations were $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared with $934 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, for fiscal 2005. The increase was driven by revenue growth, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2006 and a comparable store sales gain of 4.9%, and a significant increase in our gross profit rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in our SG&A expenses. In addition, earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 benefited from net interest income of $77 million, compared with net interest income of $1 million for the prior fiscal year, and a lower effective income tax rate. Revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 12% to $30.8 billion, compared with $27.4 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase resulted from the net addition of 103 stores during fiscal 2006, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2005, the 4.9% comparable store sales gain and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for more than one half of the revenue increase for fiscal 2006. The comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly two fifths of the revenue increase, and the remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as income related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage. We believe our comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2006 benefited from continued demand for the latest technologies and advanced product features. In addition, the increased affordability of consumer electronics products contributed to the comparable store sales gain. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2006 comparable store sales gain included flat panel televisions, MP3 players and accessories, notebook computers, digital cameras and accessories, and video gaming hardware. Flat panel 31 television sales were very strong as unit volume growth and increased screen size more than offset declines in the average selling prices of these products. MP3 products also generated strong comparable store sales gains as customers continue to adopt, upgrade and add accessories to digital music players. Our gross profit rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 25.0% of revenue. The increase was driven by the continued transformation of our supply chain, which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs, more effective pricing strategies and increased sales of higher margin services; and private label products. We also benefited from better product transition management and a more stable promotional environment. Our SG&A rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 19.7% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to increased performance based incentive compensation resulting from our strong financial performance; a growing number of stores operating under the higher cost, customer centric labor model; costs associated with supporting our services business and the absence of favorable settlements with two credit card companies as recognized in fiscal 2005. These factors were partially offset by expense leverage resulting from a higher revenue base, as well as the absence of charges recognized in fiscal 2005 to correct our accounting for leases and to settle litigation. The change in our accounting for stock based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.4% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year. Because retailers do not uniformly record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to certain other retailers. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financials Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal 2005 Results Compared With Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2005 earnings from continuing operations were $934 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, compared with $800 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for fiscal 2004. The increase was driven primarily by revenue growth, including a comparable store sales gain of 4.3%, and an improvement in our SG&A rate, and was partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate. In addition, earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 benefited from net interest income of $1 million, compared with net interest expense of $8 million for fiscal 2004, and a lower effective income tax rate. Revenue for fiscal 2005 increased 12% to $27.4 billion, compared with $24.5 billion for fiscal 2004. The increase resulted from the addition of 78 stores in fiscal 2005, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2004, the 4.3% comparable store sales gain and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for approximately three fifths of the revenue increase for fiscal 2005. The comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly two fifths of the revenue increase, and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase. We believe our comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2005 reflected improved in store execution, including our ability to increase the close rate and average ticket, which more than offset customer traffic declines in our stores. In addition, our fiscal 2005 comparable store sales gain benefited from continued demand for digital products and our effective advertising and promotional campaigns, including a full year of Reward Zone, our customer loyalty program introduced in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2005 comparable store sales gain included digital televisions, MP3 players, digital cameras and accessories, notebook computers, DVDs and major appliances. We believe the increase in revenue from digital products reflected the continued consumer migration to and increased affordability of digital products, while the increase in notebook computers was driven primarily by consumers continued attraction to the portability of these products. Our gross profit rate for fiscal 2005 declined by 0.2% of revenue to 23.7% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a more promotional environment compared with fiscal 2004, including a full year of impact from and increased membership in Reward Zone. Reward Zone contributed to the revenue gain for fiscal 2005, but reduced the fiscal 2005 gross profit rate by approximately 0.5% of 32 revenue, compared with a 0.3% of revenue reduction in the gross profit rate for fiscal 2004. In addition, our gross profit rate was affected by a higher level of promotional activity initiated to increase revenue and stem customer traffic declines, a trend we believe was experienced throughout the consumer electronics retail industry. The increase in promotional activity was partially offset by the increase of services revenue in the revenue mix, as services carry a higher gross profit rate, and benefits from our global sourcing initiative which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs. Our SG&A rate for fiscal 2005 declined by 0.2% of revenue to 18.4% of revenue. The improvement was due primarily to reduced performance based incentive compensation, expense leverage from the comparable store sales gain and the addition of new stores, and the realization of cost savings from our efficient enterprise initiative. Our fiscal 2005 SG&A rate also benefited from favorable settlements with two credit card companies. These factors were partially offset by additional expenses associated with our customer centricity initiative, and charges to correct our accounting for leases and to settle litigation which, collectively, increased our SG&A rate for fiscal 2005 by approximately 0.2% of revenue. Segment Performance Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Domestic Segment Performance Summary (unaudited) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue $ 27,380 $ 24,616 $ 22,225 Total revenue gain % 11 % 11 % 15 % Comparable stores sales % gain(1) 5.1 % 4.4 % 7.4 % Gross profit as % of revenue 25.3 % 23.8 % 24.1 % SG&A as % of revenue 19.5 % 18.2 % 18.4 % Operating income $ 1,588 $ 1,393 $ 1,267 Operating income as % of revenue 5.8 % 5.7 % 5.7 % Note: All periods presented reflect the classification of Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations. (1) Comprised of revenue at stores and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. For fiscal 2006, our Domestic segments operating income was $1.6 billion, or 5.8% of revenue, compared with $1.4 billion, or 5.7% of revenue, for fiscal 2005. The Domestic segments operating income rate for fiscal 2006 benefited from revenue gains, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2006 and a 5.1% comparable store sales increase, and an increase in the gross profit rate, partially offset by an increase in the SG&A rate. Our Domestic segments revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 11% to $27.4 billion. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for over one half of the revenue increase for fiscal 2006, and the remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the 5.1% comparable store sales gain. We believe our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2006 benefited from continued demand for increased features, assortment, portability and affordability of consumer electronics products. Our Domestic segments consumer electronics product group posted a 15.0% comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2006, driven by sales of flat panel televisions, and MP3 players and accessories. Strong sales of flat panel televisions resulted from unit volume growth and increased screen size, which more than offset declines in the average selling prices of these products. MP3 products also generated strong comparable store sales gains as customers continued to adopt, upgrade and add accessories to digital music players. A 0.3% comparable store sales gain in our Domestic segments home office product group was driven primarily by sales of 33 notebook computers, reflecting expanded assortments and continued customer demand for portable technology, and an increase in computer services revenue. A 6.3% comparable store sales increase in our Domestic segments appliances product group was driven primarily by the expansion of our improved appliance assortments and an increase in the average selling prices of major appliances. Our Domestic segments entertainment software product group recorded a 5.7% comparable store sales decline for fiscal 2006. Continued softness in the sales of new movie and music releases contributed to the comparable store sales decrease. This decrease was partially offset by strong customer response to the launches of PlayStation Portable and the Xbox 360 console, which more than offset softness in sales of gaming platforms leading up to these anticipated launches. Our Domestic segments gross profit rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.5% of revenue to 25.3% of revenue. The increase was driven by the continued transformation of our supply chain, which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs, more effective pricing strategies, and increased sales of higher margin services and private label products. We also benefited from better product transition management, a more stable promotional environment and income related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage. Our Domestic segments SG&A rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 19.5% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to increased incentive compensation based on our strong operating results, a growing number of stores operating under the customer centric labor model and costs associated with supporting our services business, partially offset by expense leverage resulting from a higher revenue base and the absence of charges recognized in fiscal 2005 to correct our accounting for leases and to settle litigation. The change in our accounting for stock based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.5% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year.

Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2006, our International segments operating income was $56 million, or 1.6% of revenue, compared with $49 million, or 1.7% of revenue, for fiscal 2005. The International segments $7 million increase in operating income resulted primarily from revenue gains, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2006 and a 2.8% comparable store sales increase. Our International segments revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 23% to $3.5 billion for fiscal 2006, compared with $2.8 billion for fiscal 2005. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for over one half of the revenue increase for fiscal 2006; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately one third of the revenue increase; and the 2.8% comparable store sales gain accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase. We believe the comparable store sales increase reflected market share gains and was driven by increased revenue from flat panel televisions, and MP3 players and accessories. Our International segments consumer electronics and appliances groups posted an 8.2% and 18.0% comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2006, respectively. Our International segments home office and entertainment software groups recorded a 0.2% and 7.6% comparable store sales decline for fiscal 2006, respectively. Our International segments gross profit rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 0.4% of revenue to 22.9% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to improved product margins and the favorable comparison with an early contract termination penalty incurred in the prior fiscal year. Our International segments SG&A rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 0.6% of revenue to 21.3% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to costs incurred as a result of restructuring our International segments operations, including severance costs associated with staff reductions, as well as incremental costs to roll out Canadian Best Buy stores in Quebec. The change in our accounting for stock based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.1% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and the Future Shop tradename. Based on expectations for the business and the prevailing retail environment, we determined that no impairment existed. However, if future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or if we ever were to discontinue the use of the Future Shop tradename as a result of abandoning our dual branding strategy in Canada or otherwise, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future. 35 The following table reconciles International stores open at the beginning and end of fiscal 2006: Total Stores at End of Fiscal 2005 Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal 2006 Future Shop 114 5 1 118 Canadian Best Buy 30 14 44 Canadian Geek Squad 5 5 Total 144 24 1 167 Note: During fiscal 2006, we relocated or remodeled eight Future Shop stores. No Canadian Best Buy stores were relocated or remodeled during fiscal 2006. At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 118 Future Shop stores throughout all Canadian provinces; 44 Canadian Best Buy stores in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; and five Canadian Geek Squad stores in British Columbia and Ontario.

No Future Shop stores were remodeled during fiscal 2005. No Canadian Best Buy stores were relocated or remodeled during fiscal 2005. At the end of fiscal 2005, we operated 114 Future Shop stores throughout all Canadian provinces and 30 Canadian Best Buy stores in Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Discontinued Operations The sale of Musicland during fiscal 2004 resulted in an after tax loss on the disposal of discontinued operations totaling $66 million. The results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 are included through the date of the sale, June 16, 2003. For additional information regarding discontinued operations, refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The results from discontinued operations for the past three fiscal years are as follows ($ in millions): For the Fiscal Years Ended Feb. 25, 2006 Feb. 26, 2005 Feb. 28, 2004 Revenue $ $ $ 354 Loss before income taxes (46 ) Loss before the disposal and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of $17 tax (29 ) Gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations(1) 50 (66 ) Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ $ 50 $ (95 ) (1) Fiscal 2005 gain on disposal of discontinued operations represents the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as a result of the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland. The fiscal 2004 loss on disposal of discontinued operations is net of $25 million tax benefit offset by a $25 million valuation allowance. 36 Additional Consolidated Results Net Interest Income (Expense) Net interest income increased to $77 million for fiscal 2006, compared with net interest income of $1 million for fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of higher yields on investments and higher average investment balances. Fiscal 2006 net interest income included $8 million of interest expense related to our financing leases, while fiscal 2005 included $21 million of interest expense related to our financing leases as a result of correcting our accounting for leases in fiscal 2005. We reported net interest income of $1 million for fiscal 2005, compared with net interest expense of $8 million for fiscal 2004. The change in net interest income (expense) was primarily a result of higher yields on short term investments, higher average investment balances and the repayment in June 2004 of our convertible debentures due in 2021. These factors were partially offset by a charge of $21 million to correct our accounting for leases. For additional information regarding net interest income (expense), refer to Note 6, Net Interest Income (Expense), of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate decreased to 33.7% for fiscal 2006, compared with 35.3% for fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased income tax benefits from our foreign operations and higher levels of tax exempt interest. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 35.3% for fiscal 2005, down from 38.3% for fiscal 2004. The decrease was due to resolution and clarification of various state and federal tax matters. During fiscal 2005, we reduced our tax contingencies reserve due to the favorable resolution and clarification of certain federal and state income tax matters, including a favorable ruling from the IRS and the completion of IRS and certain state tax audits for fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2002. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The impact of inflation and changing prices has not been material to our revenue or earnings from continuing operations in any of the last three fiscal years. Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products affect our ability to increase our gross profit rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We ended fiscal 2006 with $3.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, an increase from $3.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2005. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2006, consistent with the end of fiscal 2005. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our short term investments are comprised of municipal and U.S. government debt securities, with original maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year. Long term investments are also comprised of municipal and U.S. government debt securities, but with original maturities of one year or more. In accordance with our investment policy, we place our investments in debt securities with issuers who have high quality credit and limit the amount of investment exposure to any one issuer. We seek to preserve principal and minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. The carrying amount of our investments in debt securities approximated fair value at February 25, 2006, and February 26, 2005, due to the rapid turnover of our portfolio and the highly liquid nature of these investments. Therefore, there were no significant unrealized holding gains or losses. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we reclassified our variable rate demand notes from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments for all periods presented. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported total assets or net earnings. 37 Our liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and warranty programs. Restricted cash balances, which are included in other current assets, totaled $178 million and $158 million as of February 25, 2006, and February 26, 2005, respectively. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,695 $ 1,981 $ 1,387 Investing activities (754 ) (1,422 ) (1,376 ) Financing activities (641 ) (459 ) (87 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 27 9 1 Discontinued operations, net (53 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 327 $ 109 $ (128 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2006, compared with $2.0 billion for fiscal 2005 and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2004. The decline in operating cash flows for fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005, was due primarily to a decrease in cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by increased earnings from continuing operations. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2006, compared with $934 million for fiscal 2005. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were due primarily to increased merchandise inventories and a decrease in accrued income taxes. Merchandise inventories increased in fiscal 2006, due primarily to the addition of new stores and changes in product mix, including expanded assortments of notebook computers, flat panel televisions, and digital cameras and accessories. The increased inventory levels also reflected our efforts to improve in stock positions in product categories that have been driving our revenue growth. Accrued income taxes decreased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to a lower effective income tax rate combined with timing of payments. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $754 million for fiscal 2006, compared with $1.4 billion for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. The decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005, was due primarily to decreased net purchases of short term and long term investments in debt securities, partially offset by increased capital spending. Refer to Capital Expenditures in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for additional information. In fiscal 2006, we used cash for the construction of new retail locations, information systems and other store projects, including the conversion of 163 U.S. Best Buy stores to our customer centricity platform. The primary purposes of the cash investment activity were to support our expansion plans, improve our operational efficiency and enhance shareholder value. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $641 million for fiscal 2006, compared with $459 million and $87 million for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005, was due primarily to an increase in repurchases of our common stock. During fiscal 2006 we repurchased $772 million of our common stock, compared with $200 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in repurchases of common stock was partially offset by a decline in long term debt repayments. During fiscal 2005 we redeemed our convertible debentures due in 2021 for $355 million. 38 Discontinued Operations Net cash used in discontinued operations was $53 million for fiscal 2004. There was no cash used in discontinued operations in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 due to the sale of our interest in Musicland during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Sources of Liquidity Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe funds generated from the expected results of operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments will be sufficient to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives for the next fiscal year. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities. We have a $200 million bank revolving credit facility which is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The facility expires on December 22, 2009, and replaced a $200 million revolving credit facility that would have expired on March 21, 2005. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement. We also pay certain facility and agent fees. The agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios. As of February 25, 2006, and February 26, 2005, $199 million and $139 million, respectively, were available under these facilities. There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities for any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit reduce amounts available under these facilities. We also have inventory financing facilities through which certain suppliers receive payments from a designated finance company on invoices we owe them. At February 25, 2006, and February 26, 2005, $59 million and $68 million, respectively, were outstanding and $177 million and $157 million, respectively, were available for use under these inventory financing facilities. Our International segment has a $22 million revolving demand facility, of which $17 million is available from February through July and $22 million is available from August through January of each year. There is no set expiration date for this facility. All borrowings under this facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement. The agreement for this facility contains certain reporting and operating covenants. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility for any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit and letters of guarantee reduced amounts available under this facility to $17 million and $15 million, at February 25, 2006, and February 26, 2005, respectively. Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At the end of fiscal 2006, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In the event we were to default on any of our other debt, it would constitute a default under our credit facilities as well. We offer our customers extended financing through a third party financial institution. The third party institution assumes the risk of collection from our customers and has no recourse against us for uncollectible amounts. Generally, these financing offers allow customers to purchase products with repayment terms ranging from 90 days to 24 months without a finance charge. Our contract with the third party financial institution extends through January 2009. If the contract were to be terminated prior to January 2009, we believe we could contract with an alternative third party financial institution or directly provide our customers with extended financing. An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio calculated as reported in Exhibit 12.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K was 9.8 and 8.4 for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. 39 Our credit ratings as of April 28, 2006, were as follows: Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch(1) BBB+ Stable Moodys(2) Baa2 Stable Standard & Poors BBB Stable (1) In April 2006, Fitch Ratings revised its ratings from BBB with a positive outlook to BBB+ with a stable outlook, reflecting our leading market position and successful operating strategy which has resulted in strong revenue growth and operating performance. The upgrade also reflects our highly liquid balance sheet and considers our exposure to a very competitive industry and changes in consumer spending over time. (2) In April 2006, Moodys Investors Service revised its ratings from Baa3 with a positive outlook to Baa2 with a stable outlook based on our ability to generate comparable store sales gains, while improving operating profit margins, our continued investment in opening or converting stores to the customer centric platform, our ability to maintain our liquidity and credit metrics, and expectations that our varied growth initiatives will not adversely affect revenue or net earnings. Factors that can impact our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible subordinated debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be downgraded. Capital Expenditures A component of our long term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2006, we invested $648 million in property and equipment, including opening 105 new stores, converting 163 stores to our customer centricity operating model, relocating 16 stores and upgrading our information technology systems. Capital expenditures are funded through cash provided by operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Refer to the Outlook for Fiscal 2007 section of this MD&A for information on our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2007. The following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 New stores $ 244 $ 182 $ 215 Store related projects(1) 206 145 111 Corporate campus(2) 29 Information technology 115 115 112 Other 83 60 78 Total capital expenditures $ 648 $ 502 $ 545 (1) Includes store remodels, relocations and or expansions, as well as various merchandising projects. (2) Construction of our new corporate campus was completed during fiscal 2004. Debt and Capital In January 2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402 million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 million in offering expenses, were $396 million. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at par, at our option, for cash on or after January 15, 2007. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15, 2007; January 15, 2012; and January 15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in 40 cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. Since holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15, 2007, we have classified our convertible subordinated debentures in the current portion of long term debt at February 25, 2006. The debentures will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391 shares per $0.001 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30 trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. At February 25, 2006, none of the criteria for conversion had been met. Since March 31, 2006, our closing stock price has exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20 days, therefore, holders currently have the option to convert their debentures into our common stock. As of May 9, 2006, no debentures had been converted to shares of our common stock. The debentures have an initial interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July 15, 2006; July 15, 2011; and July 15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the convertible debentures. In June 2004, we redeemed our convertible debentures that were due in 2021 for $355 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, in connection with the review of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a $107 million financing lease obligation for leases that did not qualify for sale leaseback accounting treatment. At the end of fiscal 2006, $157 million is outstanding under financing lease obligations. We had a master lease program which was used to construct and lease new retail locations. At the end of fiscal 2005, $55 million in leases related to new stores were outstanding under the master lease program. In May 2005, we repaid the outstanding balance of $54 million on our master lease obligation. Share Repurchases and Dividends In April 2005, our Board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The program, which became effective April 27, 2005, terminated and replaced a $500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2004. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases under the $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The $500 million share repurchase program, which became effective on June 24, 2004, terminated and replaced a $400 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 16.5 million shares at a cost of $711 million under the $1.5 billion share repurchase program, and 1.8 million shares at a cost of $61 million under the $500 million share repurchase program. At the end of fiscal 2006, $790 million of the $1.5 billion originally authorized by our Board was available for future share repurchases. During fiscal 2005, we purchased and retired 3.4 million shares at a cost of $118 million under the $500 million share repurchase program, and 2.4 million shares at a cost of $82 million under the $400 million share repurchase program. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, will be the sources of funding for the share repurchase program. In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend, then $0.07 per common share per quarter. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 10 percent. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 9 percent, to $0.08 per share per quarter. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2006, we made four dividend 41 payments totaling $0.31 per common share, or $151 million in the aggregate. During fiscal 2006, we returned a total of $923 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. We finance a portion of our new store development program through sale leaseback transactions, which involve selling stores to unrelated parties and then leasing the stores back under leases that are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with GAAP. A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in Contractual Obligations section below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item 2, Properties, and Note 7, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our debt to capitalization ratio, which represents the ratio of total debt, including the current portion of long term debt, to total capitalization (total debt plus total shareholders equity), improved to 10% at the end of fiscal 2006, compared with 12% at the end of fiscal 2005. The improvement was due primarily to an increase in shareholders equity. We view our debt to capitalization ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), was 49% at the end of fiscal 2006, compared with 51% at the end of fiscal 2005. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is considered a non GAAP financial measure and is not in accordance with, or preferable to, the ratio determined in accordance with GAAP. However, we have included this information as we believe that our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is important for understanding our operations and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations, and to fund our future growth. In addition, we believe our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owners desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is our debt to capitalization ratio. Our debt to capitalization ratio excludes capitalized operating lease obligations in both the numerator and denominator of the calculation in the table below. The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2006 2005 Debt (including current portion) $ 596 $ 600 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense) 4,413 4,007 Total debt (including capitalized operating lease obligations) $ 5,009 $ 4,607 Debt (including current portion) $ 596 $ 600 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense) 4,413 4,007 Total shareholders equity 5,257 4,449 Adjusted capitalization $ 10,266 $ 9,056 Debt to capitalization ratio 10 % 12 % Adjusted debt to capitalization ratio (including capitalized operating lease obligations) 49 % 51 % 42 Contractual Obligations The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Long term debt obligations $ 412 $ 403 $ $ 9 $ Capital lease obligations 27 3 6 4 14 Financing lease obligations 157 12 26 29 90 Interest payments 280 24 46 41 169 Operating lease obligations(1) 5,928 602 1,187 1,059 3,080 Purchase obligations(2) 1,968 1,141 454 347 26 Deferred compensation(3) Total $ 8,772 $ 2,185 $ 1,719 $ 1,489 $ 3,379 Note: For additional information refer to Note 4, Debt; Note 7, Leases; and Note 11, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (1) Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $1.5 billion as of February 25, 2006. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days. (3) Included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at February 25, 2006, is a $74 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, related balances have not been reflected in the above table. 43 Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory Reserves We value our inventory at the lower of the average cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss reserves. Our markdown reserve represents the excess of the carrying value, typically average cost, over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis. Our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, we reserve for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis. Our markdown reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. Our inventory loss reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our markdown or inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown reserve. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdown reserve at February 25, 2006, would have affected net earnings by approximately $3 million for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss reserve. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at February 25, 2006, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006. 44 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Long Lived Assets Long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein, we recorded long lived asset impairment charges totaling $4 million, in the aggregate, during the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 45 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and the Future Shop tradename for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or the Future Shop tradename may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and the Future Shop tradename using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. The carrying value of goodwill as of February 25, 2006, was $557 million. The carrying value of the Future Shop tradename as of February 25, 2006, was $44 million. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for Future Shop tradename impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if we ever were to discontinue the use of the Future Shop tradename as a result of abandoning our dual branding strategy in Canada or otherwise, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 46 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Revenue Recognition See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. We have a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn points for each purchase completed at U.S. Best Buy stores or through our BestBuy.com Web site. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at U.S. Best Buy stores. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the retail value of points that are projected to be redeemed. We offer rebates that entitle our customers to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service. Rebates are recorded as a reduction in revenue based on the percentage of rebates that are projected to be redeemed. Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions regarding and to apply judgment to estimate the amount and timing of points projected to be redeemed by members of our customer loyalty program and rebate offers projected to be redeemed by customers. Our estimate of the amount and timing of points and rebates projected to be redeemed is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue for our customer loyalty and rebate programs during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue for our customer loyalty and rebate programs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our customer loyalty and rebate program liabilities at February 25, 2006, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million and $5 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006. Costs Associated With Exit Activities We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations that are under long term leases, we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a risk free interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. Our location closing liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our location closing liability at February 25, 2006, would have affected net earnings by approximately $3 million for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006. 47 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Stock Based Compensation We have a stock based compensation plan, which includes non qualified stock options and nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 5, Shareholders Equity, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs. We determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option pricing models. Non qualified stock option awards granted prior to fiscal 2006 were valued using a Black Scholes model. Non qualified stock option awards granted in fiscal 2006 were primarily valued using a lattice model. We determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Performance based nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended February 25, 2006, would have affected net earnings by approximately $9 million for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general liability claims. However, we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. When estimating our self insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries. Periodically, management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities. Our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at February 25, 2006, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006. 48 New Accounting Standards In October 2005, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period. FSP No. FAS 13 1 requires companies to expense rent payments for building or ground leases incurred during the construction period. FSP No. FAS 13 1 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Retrospective application is permitted, but not required. We will adopt FSP No. FAS 13 1 on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a significant effect on operating income or net earnings. Outlook for Fiscal 2007 Our outlook for fiscal 2007 is based on information presently available and contains certain assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our fiscal 2007 results. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward looking statements. Looking forward to fiscal 2007, we are projecting net earnings in a range of $2.65 to $2.80 per diluted share. We expect the earnings growth to be driven primarily by an increase in revenue of 10 percent to 13 percent, a slight improvement in our gross profit rate, and a decrease in our SG&A rate. This guidance includes anticipated severance and related reorganization costs of $0.03 to $0.05 per diluted share in the first half of fiscal 2007. These costs are directly related to our efforts to increase productivity and redeploy resources to implement a simple, customer centric operating model. We estimate that our net interest income, as a percent of revenue, will remain relatively stable for fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 is projected to be approximately 35%. We are forecasting revenue of $34.0 billion to $35.0 billion for fiscal 2007, compared with revenue of $30.8 billion for fiscal 2006. We expect the opening of nearly 90 new stores will drive the revenue growth. For the fiscal year, we are projecting an increase in comparable store sales of 3% to 5%. Additionally, our fiscal 2007 reporting period includes 53 weeks. We estimate an additional week of business adds, on average, approximately $0.05 per diluted share, which is reflected in the guidance above. Our fiscal 2007 outlook assumes an improvement in our operating income rate of approximately 0.4% of revenue, due mainly to reducing our SG&A rate by 0.3% of revenue to 0.4% of revenue as we refine our operating model. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are expected to be $675 to $725 million, excluding expenditures associated with acquiring Pacific Sales and any additional acquisitions. Of that total, we expect approximately $450 million will support our planned new store openings and various store remodeling projects, including the costs of converting additional stores to our customer centricity model. Specifically, the capital expenditures are expected to support the opening of 75 to 80 new U.S. Best Buy stores, approximately three Canadian Best Buy stores and four to five Future Shop stores. We anticipate relocating 10 to 15 U.S. Best Buy stores and approximately four Future Shop stores, and expect to remodel and enhance existing stores as usual. As part of our customer centricity initiative, stores scheduled for updating typically receive new fixtures, expanded product assortments and changes in the staffing model. We also plan to enhance our home theater experience by expanding the assortment of digital TVs and continuing to add Magnolia Home Theater store within a store concepts, which we view as a differentiated solution for customers. Finally, we plan to add elements of our Best Buy For Business experience to at least 120 U.S. Best Buy stores in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 also are expected to include approximately $250 million in technology investments intended to, among other things, improve our customer service capabilities and increase our operating efficiencies. During fiscal 2007, we plan to continue with our quarterly cash dividend program. We will continue to evaluate the amount of our quarterly dividend based on our strong cash and short term investments position at the end of fiscal 2006, and our cash flows generated during fiscal 2007. We also expect to continue repurchasing our common stock during fiscal 2007 pursuant to a $1.5 billion share 49 repurchase program authorized by our Board in April 2005. There is no stated expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases. We are revising our earnings guidance practices and plan to continue providing annual guidance, including revenue and earnings per share expectations. We will no longer provide a specific forecast for quarterly earnings per share, which is consistent with managements focus on long term revenue and earnings growth generation. We dont expect the quarterly seasonality of our business to change, and anticipate that on a separate basis, each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2007 will contribute 12% to 15% of the years earnings. We intend to update our annual earnings guidance when we are reasonably confident that annual results are expected to change materially. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our debt is not subject to material interest rate volatility risk. The rates on a substantial portion of our debt may be reset, but not more than one percentage point higher than the current rates. If the rates on the debt were to be reset one percentage point higher, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $4 million. We do not manage our debt interest rate volatility risk through the use of derivative instruments. We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in Canada. A 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. We do not manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative instruments. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect interest income generated from our short term and long term investments in debt securities. If overall interest rates were one percentage point lower than current rates, our annual interest income would decline by approximately $32 million based on our short term and long term investments as of February 25, 2006. We do not manage our investment interest rate volatility risk through the use of derivative instruments. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. We do not expect any material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks for the foreseeable future. 50
