Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe transparency and clarity are the primary goals of successful financial reporting. We remain committed to increasing the transparency of our financial reporting, providing our shareholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial position and operating results. In accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that such control was effective as of March 3, 2007. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Managements report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and the related report of our independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in nine sections: Overview Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards Outlook for Fiscal 2008 Subsequent Event We believe our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks, whereas our fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks. Unless otherwise noted, this MD&A relates only to results from continuing operations. Fiscal 2005 reflects the classification of Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations. Overview Best Buy Co., Inc. is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of all U.S. store and online operations, including Best Buy, Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, operating 822 stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia at the end of fiscal 2007. Geek Squad offers residential and commercial computer repair, support and installation services in all U.S. Best Buy stores and 12 stand alone stores at the end of fiscal 2007. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high end audio and video products and related services from 20 stores located in California, Washington and Oregon at the end of fiscal 2007. Pacific Sales stores offer high end home improvement products, appliances and related services, operating 14 stores in Southern California at the end of fiscal 2007. We acquired Pacific Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The International segment is comprised of all Canada store and online operations, including Best Buy, Future Shop and Geek Squad, as well as all China store and online operations, including Best Buy, Five Star and Geek Squad. We acquired a 75% interest in Five Star in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. We opened our first Best Buy store in China on December 28, 2006. Our International segment offers products and services similar to our Domestic segments offerings. However, Canada Best Buy stores do not carry appliances. Further, Five Star stores and our China Best Buy store do not carry entertainment software. At the end of fiscal 2007, we operated 47 Canada Best Buy stores in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; 121 Future Shop stores throughout all of Canadas provinces; 135 Five Star stores located in seven of Chinas 34 provinces; and one China Best Buy store in Shanghai. 28 In support of our retail store operations, we also operate Web sites for each of our brands (BestBuy.com, BestBuyCanada.ca, BestBuy.com.cn, Five Star.cn, FutureShop.ca, GeekSquad.com, GeekSquad.ca, MagnoliaAV.com and PacificSales.com). Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season in the United States and Canada, than in any other fiscal quarter. The timing of new store openings, costs associated with the development of new businesses, as well as general economic conditions may also affect our future quarterly results. Acquisitions Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, Inc. On March 7, 2006, we acquired all of the common stock of Pacific Sales for $411 million, or $408 million, net of cash acquired, including transaction costs. We acquired Pacific Sales, a high end home improvement and appliance retailer, to enhance our ability to grow with an affluent customer base and premium brands using a proven and successful showroom format. Utilizing the existing store format, we expect to expand the number of stores in order to capitalize on the expanding high end segment of the U.S. appliance market. At March 3, 2007, Pacific Sales operated 14 showrooms in Southern California and contributed revenue of $296 million to our consolidated financial results in fiscal 2007. Jiangsu Five Star Appliance Co., Ltd. On June 8, 2006, we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star for $184 million, including a working capital injection of $122 million and transaction costs. Five Star is one of Chinas largest appliance and consumer electronics retailers, with 135 stores located in seven of Chinas 34 provinces. We made the investment in Five Star to further our international growth plans, to increase our knowledge of Chinese customers and to obtain an immediate retail presence in China. Five Star employs a business model that carries a significantly lower gross profit rate and a significantly lower selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) rate than our other operations. Consistent with Chinas statutory requirements, Five Stars fiscal year ends on December 31. Therefore, we have elected to consolidate Five Stars financial results on a two month lag. Five Stars operations for the period of June 8, 2006, through December 31, 2006, contributed revenue of $563 million to our consolidated financial results in fiscal 2007. Financial Reporting Changes To maintain consistency with our accounting policies, we reclassified selected balances from receivables to cash and cash equivalents in our February 25, 2006, consolidated balance sheet. This reclassification had no effect on previously reported operating income, net earnings or shareholders equity. In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in FSP No. FAS 123(R) 3 for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to determine the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital (APIC) pool related to the tax effects of stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of stock based awards that were fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. In accordance with SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, the change in accounting principle related to our adoption of the alternative transition method has been applied retrospectively to our fiscal 2006 consolidated statement of cash flows. The effect on the consolidated statement of cash flows was a decrease in operating activities with an offsetting increase in financing activities of $22 million in fiscal 2006. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 123(R) 3 did not have an impact on our operating income, net earnings or shareholders equity. Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Our business, broadly defined, is about meeting the needs and wants of consumers, not all of which are confined to consumer electronics. We believe that our assets position us to solve more customer problems than ever. Specifically, our assets include 140,000 engaged employees; valuable relationships with vendors all over the world; emerging relationships with companies like Accenture, Apple and Car Phone Warehouse; and all of the other mutually enriching business relationships that our people continue to establish and develop wherever we go, from Asia to Silicon Valley. 29 We also have a sizeable cash balance. All of these assets are at our disposal as we envision how well deepen our relationships with customers and increase shareholder value. Our business strategy is customer centricity. We define customer centricity through its parts, which we call our three core philosophies: inviting our employees to contribute their unique ideas and experiences in service of customers; treating customers uniquely and honoring their differences; and meeting customers unique needs, end to end. We start with a view of all of our customers, including what their problems are and what their desires are. We try to match that against everything we know about the solutions that now exist, or that could be created. Then we figure out how to get customers the right solutions by using our employees unique capabilities, as well as our network of vendors and outside partners. If we accomplish what we have set out to do, we believe these solutions may give us something unique in the marketplace, and something truly differentiated. Mass merchants, direct sellers, other specialty retailers and online retailers are increasingly interested in our product categories because of rising demand. We believe that by understanding our customers better than our competitors do, and by inspiring our employees to have richer interactions with customers, we can differentiate ourselves and compete more effectively. We further believe that this strategy can be successful for us with a variety of products and services, store formats, customer groups and even countries. Our customer centricity strategy provides the framework to grow and further enhance our business in the future. Examples of new growth areas so far have included our dual brand strategy in Canada, our Magnolia Home Theater store within a store, our Geek Squad services business, our acquisition of Pacific Sales, and our entry into China last year with the Five Star acquisition and the opening of our first Best Buy store in Shanghai. Profitably Scaling Customer Centricity In fiscal 2007, we had six key priorities aimed at scaling customer centricity. First, we implemented a single, customer centric operating model at all U.S. Best Buy stores and at the corporate campus. Moving to a single operating model eliminated redundant work and allowed us to redeploy our efforts to support growth areas. In the coming year, we plan to continue this work by refining the store operating model. Second, we opened 80 new U.S. Best Buy stores and added nearly 200 Magnolia Home Theater locations inside new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores, taking advantage of rising consumer interest in flat panel TVs. We also enhanced the home theater area of more than 130 additional new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores. We gained market share in flat panel TVs last year due in part to these investments. Additional home theater investments are planned for the coming year so we can serve a broader array of needs. Third, we built our small business capabilities. We added Best Buy For Business locations to nearly 200 U.S. Best Buy stores, and trained more than 500 Microsoft certified professionals by year end. We plan to continue to grow this business in the coming year by adding capabilities in Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), through our acquisition of Speakeasy, Inc. (Speakeasy). We believe this acquisition also will improve our ability to form strong relationships with small business customers, as customers wish to save on their telecommunications costs and have a single source for their technology needs. Fourth, we grew our services business by driving productivity improvements in computer services and home theater installation. We implemented new scheduling, routing and dispatch tools; launched a centralized repair facility (called Geek Squad City); and began a move to test a market based approach to home visits and gained economies of scale. In the coming year, we hope to accelerate the growth of our services business, particularly our home theater installation business, based on consumer demand. Fifth, we began to enhance our ability to provide complete solutions to customers. Our stores and Web sites need better tools and capabilities for describing, demonstrating and selling solutions such as digital music subscriptions, digital cable and voice over Internet telephony. We made modest progress in this area during the year and plan to accelerate this work in the coming year, starting with the infrastructure to support ongoing subscription relationships. Sixth, we have embarked on a controlled international growth strategy, beginning with China, where we have operated sourcing offices for over three years. Through our acquisition of Five Star, we expanded our retail footprint into China. We also opened our first Best Buy store in China, an 80,000 square foot store located in Shanghai. We anticipate advancing our international growth strategy by opening two to three additional Best Buy stores in China 30 within the next 12 to 18 months, and by opening test stores in Mexico and Turkey, also within the next 12 to 18 months. Results of Operations Fiscal 2007 Summary Net earnings in fiscal 2007 increased 21% to $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by revenue growth, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2007 and a comparable store sales gain of 5.0%, and a decrease in our SG&A rate. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate and a higher effective income tax rate. Revenue in fiscal 2007 increased 16% to $35.9 billion. The increase reflected market share gains and was driven by the addition of new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during fiscal 2007, a full year of revenue from stores added in fiscal 2006, a 5.0% comparable store sales increase, and the acquisitions of Five Star and Pacific Sales. The remainder of the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007 and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.6% of revenue to 24.4% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a lower margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Also contributing to the decrease, in order of impact, were a more promotional environment in the consumer electronics and home office product groups, and the inclusion of our China operations for a portion of the year. Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.9% of revenue to 18.8% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 16% growth in revenue and reduced performance based incentive compensation. Also contributing to the decrease in our SG&A rate in fiscal 2007, in order of impact, were controlled expenses related to our strategic initiatives and expense reduction efforts. These factors were partially offset by increased expenses related to asset impairments, litigation and business closure costs. Net earnings in fiscal 2007 included income of $20 million ($13 million net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) related to the gain from the sale of our investment in Golf Galaxy, Inc. In addition, net earnings in fiscal 2007 included income of $19 million ($12 million net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) related to additional recognition of gift card breakage (gift cards sold where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote). The gift card breakage was recorded as a result of determining our legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to certain states not reflected in our initial fiscal 2006 gift card breakage recognition. During fiscal 2007, we added Magnolia Home Theater rooms to nearly 200 new and existing U.S. Best Buy locations, bringing the total number of Magnolia Home Theater rooms inside U.S. Best Buy stores to more than 300 at the end of fiscal 2007. Effective with the cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 25%, to $0.10 per common share. During fiscal 2007, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.36 per common share, or $174 million in the aggregate. During fiscal 2007, we purchased and retired 11.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $599 million pursuant to our share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2007, we and The Best Buy Childrens Foundation contributed approximately $25 million to local communities. The Best Buy Childrens Foundation supports educational programs that integrate and leverage todays technology. 31 Consolidated Results The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Consolidated Performance Summary 2007 (1) 2006 2005 (2) Revenue $ 35,934 $ 30,848 $ 27,433 Total revenue gain % 16 % 12 % 12 % Comparable store sales % gain(3) 5.0 % 4.9 % 4.3 % Gross profit as % of revenue 24.4 % 25.0 % 23.7 % SG&A as % of revenue 18.8 % 19.7 % 18.4 % Operating income $ 1,999 $ 1,644 $ 1,442 Operating income as % of revenue 5.6 % 5.3 % 5.3 % Earnings from continuing operations $ 1,377 $ 1,140 $ 934 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax $ $ $ 50 Net earnings $ 1,377 $ 1,140 $ 984 Diluted earnings per share continuing operations $ 2.79 $ 2.27 $ 1.86 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.79 $ 2.27 $ 1.96 Note: All periods presented reflect the classification of Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations. (1) Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks. (2) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, following a review of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a cumulative pre tax charge of $36 ($23 net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) to correct our accounting for certain operating lease matters. Additionally, we established a sales return liability which reduced revenue by $65 and gross profit by $15 ($10 net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share). Finally, based on the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland, we recorded a $50 tax benefit. The tax benefit is included in gain on disposal of discontinued operations. (3) Comprised of revenue at store and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. Continuing Operations Fiscal 2007 Results Compared With Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2007 net earnings were $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by revenue growth, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2007 and a comparable store sales gain of 5.0%, and a decrease in our SG&A rate. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate and a higher effective income tax rate. Net earnings in fiscal 2007 also benefited from net interest income of $111 million, compared with net interest income of $77 million in the prior fiscal year. Revenue in fiscal 2007 increased 16% to $35.9 billion, compared with $30.8 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase resulted primarily from the addition of 87 new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during fiscal 2007, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2006, a 5.0% comparable store sales gain, and the acquisitions of Five Star and Pacific Sales. The remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007, the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and income related to our additional recognition of gift card breakage. The addition of new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for nearly four tenths of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007; the comparable store sales gain accounted for three tenths of the revenue increase; the acquisitions of Five Star and Pacific Sales accounted for nearly two tenths of the revenue increase; the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007 accounted for one tenth of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as income related to our additional recognition of gift card breakage. Our comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2007 benefited from a higher average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in higher ticket items, including flat panel 32 televisions and notebook computers. In addition, comparable store sales were driven by continued customer demand for and the increased affordability of these products, as strong unit volume growth was somewhat muted by declines in average selling prices. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2007 comparable store sales gain included flat panel televisions, notebook computers, video gaming and MP3 players and accessories. An increase in online purchases also contributed to the fiscal 2007 comparable store sales gain, as we continued to add features and capabilities to our Web sites. Revenue from our online operations increased approximately 36% in fiscal 2007 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.6% of revenue to 24.4% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a lower margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Also contributing to the decrease, in order of impact, were a more promotional environment in the consumer electronics and home office product groups, and the inclusion of our China operations for a portion of the year. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower gross profit rate than our other operations, reduced our gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 by approximately 0.2% of revenue. Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.9% of revenue to 18.8% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 16% growth in revenue and reduced performance based incentive compensation. Also contributing to the decrease, in order of impact, were controlled expenses related to our strategic initiatives and expense reduction efforts. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our other operations, reduced our SG&A rate by approximately 0.1% of revenue in fiscal 2007. These factors were partially offset by expenses related to increased asset impairments, litigation and business closure costs. Because retailers do not uniformly record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financials Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal 2006 Results Compared With Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2006 earnings from continuing operations were $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared with $934 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. The increase was driven primarily by revenue growth, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2006 and a comparable store sales gain of 4.9%, and a significant increase in our gross profit rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in our SG&A expenses. In addition, earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2006 benefited from net interest income of $77 million, compared with net interest income of $1 million in fiscal 2005, and a lower effective income tax rate. Revenue in fiscal 2006 increased 12% to $30.8 billion, compared with $27.4 billion in fiscal 2005. The increase resulted from the addition of 103 stores in fiscal 2006, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2005, a 4.9% comparable store sales gain and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for more than one half of the revenue increase in fiscal 2006. The comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly four tenths of the revenue increase, and the remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as income related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage. We believe our comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2006 benefited from continued demand for the latest technologies and advanced product features. In addition, the increased affordability of consumer electronics products contributed to the comparable store sales gain. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2006 comparable store sales gain included flat panel televisions, MP3 players and accessories, notebook computers, digital cameras and accessories and video gaming hardware. Flat panel television sales were very strong as unit volume growth and increased screen size more than offset declines in the average selling prices of these products. MP3 products also generated strong comparable store sales gains as customers continue to adopt, upgrade and add accessories to digital music players. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 25.0% of revenue. The increase was driven by the continued transformation of our supply chain, which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs, more effective pricing strategies and increased sales of higher margin services; and private label products. We 33 also benefited from better product transition management and a more stable promotional environment. Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 19.7% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to increased performance based incentive compensation resulting from our strong financial performance; a growing number of stores operating under the higher cost, customer centric labor model; costs associated with supporting our services business and the absence of favorable settlements with two credit card companies as recognized in fiscal 2005. These factors were partially offset by expense leverage resulting from a higher revenue base, as well as the absence of charges recognized in fiscal 2005 to correct our accounting for leases and to settle litigation. The change in our accounting for stock based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.4% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year. Segment Performance Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Domestic Segment Performance Summary (unaudited) 2007 (1) 2006 2005 Revenue $ 31,031 $ 27,380 $ 24,616 Total revenue gain % 13 % 11 % 11 % Comparable store sales % gain(2) 4.1 % 5.1 % 4.4 % Gross profit as % of revenue 24.8 % 25.3 % 23.8 % SG&A as % of revenue 18.8 % 19.5 % 18.2 % Operating income $ 1,889 $ 1,588 $ 1,393 Operating income as % of revenue 6.1 % 5.8 % 5.7 % (1) Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks. (2) Comprised of revenue at store and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. All comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. In fiscal 2007, our Domestic segments operating income was $1.9 billion, or 6.1% of revenue, compared with $1.6 billion, or 5.8% of revenue, in fiscal 2006. The Domestic segments operating income rate in fiscal 2007 benefited from revenue gains, including the addition of 80 new Best Buy stores during fiscal 2007 and a 4.1% comparable store sales increase, and a decrease in the SG&A rate, partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segments revenue in fiscal 2007 increased 13% to $31.0 billion. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for nearly one half of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007; a 4.1% comparable store sales gain accounted for approximately three tenths of the revenue increase; the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007 accounted for over one tenth of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Pacific Sales and income related to our additional recognition of gift card breakage. Our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2007 benefited from a higher average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in higher ticket items, including flat panel televisions and notebook computers. Also contributing to the fiscal 2007 comparable store sales gain was an increase in online purchases, as we continued to add features and capabilities to our Web sites. Revenue from our Domestic segments online operations increased approximately 39% in fiscal 2007 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our Domestic segments consumer electronics product group posted an 8.7% comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2007, driven by sales of flat panel televisions and MP3 players and accessories, partially offset by declines in tube and projection televisions. Comparable store sales gains from flat panel television unit volume growth and increased screen size were somewhat muted by declines in average selling prices. 34 A 3.0% comparable store sales gain in our Domestic segments entertainment software product group was due primarily to sales growth in video gaming, driven by the increased affordability of existing platforms, as well as the launches of Sony Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii. The comparable store sales gains were partially offset by continued softness in sales of new music and movie releases. Our Domestic segments home office product group recorded a 0.5% comparable store sales decrease in fiscal 2007, driven primarily by declines in desktop computers and printers. The comparable store sales declines were partially offset by growth in notebook computers, reflecting continued consumer demand for portable technology. A 2.1% comparable store sales decline in our Domestic segments appliances product group was driven primarily by declines in sales of small appliances. Comparable store sales of major appliances were flat in fiscal 2007, as benefits from the expansion of our improved appliance assortments were offset by a softer housing market. Our Domestic segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.5% of revenue to 24.8% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a lower margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Also contributing to the decrease was a more promotional environment in the consumer electronics and home office product groups. Our Domestic segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.7% of revenue to 18.8% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 13% growth in revenue and reduced performance based incentive compensation. Also contributing to the decrease, in order of impact, were controlled expenses related to our strategic initiatives and expense reduction efforts. These factors were partially offset by expenses related to increased asset impairments, litigation and business closure costs.

At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 742 U.S. Best Buy stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia; 20 Magnolia Audio Video stores in California, Washington and Oregon; and 12 U.S. Geek Squad stores in Georgia, Texas, California, Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin. 35 International The following table presents selected financial data for our International segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): International Segment Performance Summary (unaudited) 2007 (1) 2006 2005 Revenue $ 4,903 $ 3,468 $ 2,817 Total revenue gain % 41 % 23 % 21 % Comparable store sales % gain(2) 11.7 % 2.8 % 3.3 % Gross profit as % of revenue 21.6 % 22.9 % 22.5 % SG&A as % of revenue 19.4 % 21.3 % 20.7 % Operating income $ 110 $ 56 $ 49 Operating income as % of revenue 2.2 % 1.6 % 1.7 % (1) Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks. (2) Comprised of revenue at stores and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. In fiscal 2007, our International segments operating income was $110 million, or 2.2% of revenue, compared with $56 million, or 1.6% of revenue, in fiscal 2006. The increase in our International segments operating income resulted primarily from revenue gains, including the acquisition of Five Star and an 11.7% comparable store sales increase, and a significant reduction in the SG&A rate. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate. Our International segments revenue increased 41% to $4.9 billion in fiscal 2007, compared with $3.5 billion in fiscal 2006. The acquisition of Five Star accounted for nearly four tenths of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007; the 11.7% comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly three tenths of the revenue increase; the addition of new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for over one tenth of the revenue increase; the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for over one tenth of the revenue increase; and the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007 accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase. We believe the comparable store sales increase reflected market share gains and was driven by increased sales of flat panel televisions, video gaming and notebook computers, partially offset by declines in tube and projection televisions. Our International segment reported comparable store sales increases in fiscal 2007 in the consumer electronics, home office, entertainment software and appliances product groups of 15.5%, 7.6%, 12.1% and 8.1%, respectively. Revenue from our International segments online operations increased approximately 19% and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our International segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 1.3% of revenue to 21.6% of revenue. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower gross profit rate than our Canada operations, reduced our International segments gross profit rate by approximately 1.1% of revenue in fiscal 2007. The remainder of the decrease in our International segments gross profit rate was due primarily to increased financing costs, resulting from increased borrowing rates and a shift toward longer term financing programs in conjunction with strong flat panel television sales. Our International segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 1.9% of revenue to 19.4% of revenue. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our Canada operations, reduced our International segments SG&A rate by approximately 0.7% of revenue in fiscal 2007. The remainder of the decrease in our International segments SG&A rate was due primarily to, in order of impact, the leveraging effect of the 41% growth in revenue; improvements in the labor model used in our Canada Best Buy stores; reduced Canada headquarters payroll costs at the end of fiscal 2006; and the leveraging effect of the 11.7% comparable store sales gain on advertising expense as a percentage of revenue. A performance driven increase in incentive based compensation, expenses incurred related to the closure of all six Canada Geek Squad stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and increased asset impairment charges partially offset the decrease. 36 The following table reconciles International stores open at the beginning and end of fiscal 2007: Total Stores at End of Fiscal 2006 Stores Opened Stores Acquired Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal 2007 Future Shop 118 3 121 Canada Best Buy 44 3 47 Canada Geek Squad 5 1 6 Five Star 8 131 4 135 China Best Buy 1 1 Total International stores 167 16 131 10 304 Note: During fiscal 2007, we relocated four Future Shop stores and three Five Star stores. No other stores in the International segment were relocated during fiscal 2007. At the end of fiscal 2007, we operated 121 Future Shop stores throughout all of Canadas provinces; 47 Canada Best Buy stores in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; 135 Five Star stores throughout seven of Chinas 34 provinces; and one China Best Buy store in Shanghai.

No other stores in the International segment were relocated during fiscal 2006. At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 118 Future Shop stores throughout all of Canadas provinces; 44 Canada Best Buy stores in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; and five Canada Geek Squad stores in British Columbia and Ontario. Discontinued Operations In fiscal 2004, we sold our interest in Musicland. The buyer assumed all of Musiclands liabilities, including approximately $500 million in lease obligations and paid no cash consideration, in exchange for all of the capital stock of Musicland. The transaction also resulted in the transfer of all of Musiclands assets, other than a distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating assets. On March 25, 2005, we received notification from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland. Based on the agreement with the IRS, we reversed previously recorded valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to the disposition of our interest in Musicland and recognized a $50 million tax benefit in fiscal 2005. Additional Consolidated Results Net Interest Income Net interest income increased to $111 million in fiscal 2007, compared with net interest income of $77 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to higher investment yields. Fiscal 2007 net interest income included $11 million of interest expense related to our financing leases, compared with $8 million of interest expense in fiscal 2006. We recognized net interest income of $77 million in fiscal 2006, compared with net interest income of $1 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of higher yields on investments and higher average investment balances. Fiscal 2006 net interest income included $8 million of interest expense related to our financing leases, while fiscal 2005 included $21 million of interest expense related to our financing leases as a result of correcting our accounting for leases in fiscal 2005. For additional information regarding net interest income, refer to Note 7, Net Interest Income, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate increased to 35.3% in fiscal 2007, compared with 33.7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a change in the composition of taxable income between foreign and domestic entities. 37 Our effective income tax rate decreased to 33.7% in fiscal 2006, compared with 35.3% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to increased income tax benefits from our foreign operations and higher levels of tax exempt interest. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products affect our ability to increase our gross profit rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We ended fiscal 2007 with $3.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, consistent with the end of fiscal 2006. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $2.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2007, up from $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2006. The increase in working capital was due primarily to the reclassification of $402 million of convertible debentures from short term to long term debt and an increase in other current assets, driven by restricted cash assumed in connection with the acquisition of Five Star. Five Stars restricted cash represents bank deposits pledged as security for certain vendor payables. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market accounts and other highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. Our short term investments are comprised of municipal and U.S. government debt securities as well as auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes, with original maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year. Long term investments are also comprised of municipal and U.S. government debt securities, but with original maturities of one year or more. In accordance with our investment policy, we place our investments with issuers who have high quality credit and limit the amount of investment exposure to any one issuer. We seek to preserve principal and minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. The carrying amount of our investments approximated fair value at March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, due to the rapid turnover of our portfolio and the highly liquid nature of these investments. Therefore, there were no significant realized or unrealized gains or losses. Our liquidity is affected by restricted cash and investments in debt securities that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and warranty programs. Restricted cash and investments in debt securities, which are included in other current assets, totaled $382 million and $178 million as of March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, respectively. The increase in restricted cash and investments in debt securities was due primarily to restricted cash assumed in connection with the acquisition of Five Star. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,762 $ 1,740 $ 1,981 Investing activities (780 ) (754 ) (1,422 ) Financing activities (513 ) (619 ) (459 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (12 ) 27 9 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 457 $ 394 $ 109 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in fiscal 2007, compared with $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006 and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006, increased net earnings and increases in deferred income taxes and depreciation expense were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net earnings increased to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2007, compared with $1.1 billion in fiscal 2006. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were due primarily to 38 changes in accrued income taxes and merchandise inventories. The increase in cash used for changes in accrued income taxes resulted mainly from a higher effective income tax rate combined with the timing of payments. The increase in cash used for changes in merchandise inventories was due primarily to increased inventory levels. Inventory levels increased due to the addition of new stores, expanded product assortments in key product categories and improved in stock positions. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $780 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $754 million in fiscal 2006 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2005. The change in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006, was due primarily to cash used to acquire Pacific Sales and Five Star, and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by increased net sales of investments in debt securities. Refer to Capital Expenditures below for additional information. In fiscal 2007, we used cash for the construction of new retail locations, information systems and other store projects, including relocations and remodels. The primary purposes of the cash investment activity were to support our expansion plans and improve our operational efficiency. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $513 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $619 million and $459 million in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The change in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006, was due primarily to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased $599 million of our common stock, compared with $772 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in repurchases of common stock was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our stock based compensation programs. Sources of Liquidity Our most significant sources of liquidity continue to be funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments. We believe funds generated from the expected results of operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments will be sufficient to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives for the next fiscal year. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities. Our Domestic segment has a $200 million bank revolving credit facility which is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The facility expires on December 22, 2009. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement. We also pay certain facility and agent fees. There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities for any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit reduce amounts available under this facility. At March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, $200 million and $199 million, respectively, were available under this facility. We also have inventory financing facilities through which certain suppliers receive payments from a designated finance company on invoices we owe them. At March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, $39 million and $59 million, respectively, were outstanding and included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets; and $196 million and $177 million, respectively, were available for use under these inventory financing facilities. Our International segment has a $21 million revolving demand facility for our Canada operations, of which $17 million is available from February through July, and $21 million is available from August through January of each year. There is no set expiration date for this facility. All borrowings under this facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the agreement. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility for any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit and letters of guarantee reduced amounts available under this facility to $16 million and $17 million, at March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, respectively. Our International segment also has a $23 million revolving demand facility to finance working capital requirements for our China operations. This facility may be terminated at any time and is subject to review by June 30, 2007. $20 million in borrowings were outstanding under this facility as of the balance sheet date. Borrowings under this facility are secured by a guarantee of Best Buy Co., Inc. and bear interest at rates specified in the agreement. Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facilities, including financial covenants. The financial 39 covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At the end of fiscal 2007, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In the event we were to default on any of our other debt, it would constitute a default under our credit facilities as well. An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in Exhibit No. 12.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, was 10.3 and 9.8 in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our credit ratings at April 30, 2007, were as follows: Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch(1) BBB+ Stable Moodys(2) Baa2 Stable Standard & Poors BBB Stable (1) In April 2006, Fitch Ratings revised its rating from BBB with a positive outlook to BBB+ with a stable outlook. The upgrade reflected our leading market position and successful operating strategy, which has resulted in strong revenue growth and operating performance. The upgrade also reflected our highly liquid balance sheet and considered our exposure to a very competitive industry and changes in consumer spending over time. (2) In April 2006, Moodys Investors Service revised its rating from Baa3 with a positive outlook to Baa2 with a stable outlook. The upgrade was based on our ability to generate comparable store sales gains, while improving operating profit margins, our continued investment in opening or converting stores to the customer centric platform, our ability to maintain our liquidity and credit metrics, and expectations that our varied growth initiatives will not adversely affect revenue or net earnings. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and vendor financing terms and result in higher long term lease costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible subordinated debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be significantly downgraded. Capital Expenditures A component of our long term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2007, we invested $733 million in property and equipment, including opening 96 new stores, adding Magnolia Home Theater rooms inside nearly 200 new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores, relocating 20 stores and upgrading our information technology systems. Capital expenditures are funded through cash provided by operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Refer to the Outlook for Fiscal 2008 section of this MD&A for information on our capital expenditure plans in fiscal 2008. The following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 New stores $ 253 $ 244 $ 182 Store related projects(1) 251 206 145 Information technology 121 115 115 Other 108 83 60 Total capital expenditures $ 733 $ 648 $ 502 (1) Includes store remodels, relocations and or expansions, as well as various merchandising projects. 40 Debt and Capital In January 2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402 million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 million in offering expenses, were $396 million. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at par, at our option, for cash on or after January 15, 2007. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15, 2012, and January 15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. On January 15, 2007, holders had the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. However, no debentures were so purchased. The debentures become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30 trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. During a portion of fiscal 2007, our closing stock price exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20 trading days in a 30 day trading period. Therefore, debenture holders had the option to convert their debentures into shares of our common stock. However, no debentures were so converted. Due to changes in the price of our common stock, the debentures were no longer convertible at March 3, 2007, and have not been convertible through May 1, 2007. The debentures have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July 15, 2011, and July 15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the convertible debentures. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, in connection with the review of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a $107 million financing lease obligation for lease transactions that did not qualify for sale leaseback accounting treatment. At the end of fiscal 2007, $171 million was outstanding under financing lease obligations. Share Repurchases and Dividends From time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity based incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital structure. In June 2006, our Board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The program, which became effective June 21, 2006, terminated and replaced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in April 2005. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases under the June 2006 share repurchase program. The April 2005 share repurchase program, which became effective on April 27, 2005, terminated and replaced a $500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2004. During fiscal 2007, we purchased and retired 5.6 million shares at a cost of $267 million under the June 2006 share repurchase program, and 6.2 million shares at a cost of $332 million under the April 2005 share repurchase program. At the end of fiscal 2007, $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion originally authorized by our Board was available for future share repurchases under the June 2006 share repurchase program. During fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 16.5 million shares at a cost of $711 million under the April 2005 share repurchase program, and 1.8 million shares at a cost of $61 million under the June 2004 share repurchase program. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved by our Board under the June 2006 share repurchase program, we do not expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity. 41 In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend, then $0.07 per common share per quarter. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 10%. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 9%, to $0.08 per common share per quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 25% to $0.10 per common share per quarter. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2007, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.36 per common share, or $174 million in the aggregate. During fiscal 2007, we returned a total of $773 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. We finance a portion of our new store development program through sale leaseback transactions. These transactions involve selling stores to unrelated parties and then leasing the stores back. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the Contractual Obligations section below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item 2, Properties, and Note 8, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our debt to capitalization ratio, which represents the ratio of total debt, including the current portion of long term debt, to total capitalization (total debt plus total shareholders equity), improved to 9% at the end of fiscal 2007, compared with 10% at the end of fiscal 2006. The improvement was due primarily to an increase in shareholders equity. We view our debt to capitalization ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), was 49% at the end of fiscal 2007, consistent with the end of fiscal 2006. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is considered a non GAAP financial measure and is not in accordance with, or preferable to, the ratio determined in accordance with GAAP. However, we have included this information as we believe that our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is important for understanding our operations and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations, and to fund our future growth. In addition, we believe our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owners desire to own or to lease the location, and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is our debt to capitalization ratio. Our debt to capitalization ratio excludes capitalized operating lease obligations in both the numerator and denominator of the calculation in the following table. 42 The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations ($ in millions): 2007 2006 Debt (including current portion) $ 650 $ 596 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense)(1) 5,401 4,413 Total debt (including capitalized operating lease obligations) $ 6,051 $ 5,009 Debt (including current portion) $ 650 $ 596 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense)(1) 5,401 4,413 Total shareholders equity 6,201 5,257 Adjusted capitalization $ 12,252 $ 10,266 Debt to capitalization ratio 9 % 10 % Adjusted debt to capitalization ratio (including capitalized operating lease obligations) 49 % 49 % (1) The multiple of eight times rental expense used to calculate our capitalized operating lease obligations total is the multiple used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness. Contractual Obligations The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Short term debt obligations $ 41 $ 41 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations 414 2 9 403 Capital lease obligations 24 3 6 2 13 Financing lease obligations 171 14 30 33 94 Interest payments 208 25 38 33 112 Operating lease obligations(1) 6,668 741 1,387 1,224 3,316 Purchase obligations(2) 2,198 1,113 775 291 19 Deferred compensation(3) 75 (3) Total $ 9,799 $ 1,939 $ 2,245 $ 1,986 $ 3,554 Note: For additional information refer to Note 5, Debt; Note 8, Leases; and Note 12, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (1) Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $1.6 billion at March 3, 2007. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days. (3) Included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at March 3, 2007, was a $75 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the Payments Due by Period section of the above table. 43 Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory Reserves We value our inventory at the lower of the average cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss reserves. Our markdown reserve represents the excess of the carrying value, typically average cost, over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis. Our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, we reserve for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis. Our markdown reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. Our inventory loss reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our markdown or inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown reserve. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdown reserve at March 3, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $3 million in fiscal 2007. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss reserve. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at March 3, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $4 million in fiscal 2007. 44 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Long Lived Assets Long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein, we recorded long lived asset impairment charges totaling $32 million, in the aggregate, during fiscal 2007. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 45 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. The carrying value of goodwill at March 3, 2007, was $919 million. The carrying value of other intangible assets at March 3, 2007, was $81 million. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Effective March 4, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on retained earnings. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 46 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Revenue Recognition See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. We have a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn points for each purchase completed at U.S. Best Buy stores, through our BestBuy.com Web site or when using our customer loyalty program credit card. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at U.S. Best Buy stores. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the retail value of points that are projected to be redeemed. Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions regarding and to apply judgment to estimate the amount and timing of points projected to be redeemed by members of our customer loyalty program. Our estimate of the amount and timing of points projected to be redeemed is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue for our customer loyalty program during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue for our customer loyalty program. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program liability at March 3, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million in fiscal 2007. Costs Associated With Exit Activities We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations that are under long term leases, we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a risk adjusted interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. Our location closing liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our location closing liability at March 3, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $3 million in fiscal 2007. 47 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Stock Based Compensation We have a stock based compensation plan, which includes non qualified stock options and nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Shareholders Equity, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs. We determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option pricing models. Non qualified stock option awards granted through fiscal 2005 were valued using a Black Scholes model. Non qualified stock option awards granted after fiscal 2005 were valued primarily using a lattice model. We determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Performance based nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended March 3, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2007. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general liability claims. However, we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. When estimating our self insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries. Periodically, management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities. Our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at March 3, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $3 million in fiscal 2007. 48 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation In accordance with accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. Minority interests proportionate ownership of assets and liabilities are recorded at historical carrying values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventory, identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames, and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three fiscal years, we completed two significant acquisitions. On March 7, 2006, we acquired Pacific Sales for $411 million including transaction costs. On June 8, 2006, we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star for $184 million, including a working capital injection of $122 million and transaction costs. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for the complete purchase price allocation calculations. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 49 New Accounting Standards In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN No. 48 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 upon initial adoption will be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. We are evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our operating income, net earnings or retained earnings. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN No. 48 1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48. FSP FIN No. 48 1 provides guidance on how a company should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN No. 48 1 is effective upon initial adoption of FIN No. 48, which we will adopt in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as indicated above. In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB No. 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The cumulative effect of initially applying the provisions of SAB No. 108 may be reported as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the year of adoption. The adoption of SAB No. 108 had no impact on our net earnings or financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 157 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our operating income or net earnings. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Companies are not allowed to adopt SFAS No. 159 on a retrospective basis unless they choose early adoption. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2009. We are evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our operating income or net earnings. Outlook for Fiscal 2008 Our outlook for fiscal 2008 is based on information presently available and contains certain assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our fiscal 2008 results. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward looking statements. Looking forward to fiscal 2008, we are projecting net earnings in a range of $3.10 to $3.25 per diluted share, an average increase of 14%. We expect the earnings growth to be driven primarily by an increase in revenue of approximately 9% and a reduction in our SG&A rate, partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 is projected to be approximately 36%. Specifically, we are forecasting revenue of $39.0 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with revenue of $35.9 billion in fiscal 2007. We expect the opening of approximately 130 new stores will drive more than half of the revenue growth. For the fiscal year, we are projecting an increase in comparable store sales of 3% to 5%. Our fiscal 2008 reporting period will include 52 weeks, whereas our fiscal 2007 reporting period included 53 weeks. 50 Our fiscal 2008 outlook assumes an improvement in our operating income rate of approximately 0.3% of revenue, compared with fiscal 2007. The improvement in our operating income rate is expected to be driven by a reduction in our SG&A rate of 0.6% to 0.7% of revenue as we continue to improve efficiency and leverage revenue growth. The improvement in our SG&A rate is expected is to be partially offset by a decline in our gross profit rate of 0.3% to 0.4% of revenue, driven primarily by a lower margin revenue mix. Consistent with managements focus on long term revenue and earnings growth generation, we do not provide a specific forecast for quarterly earnings per share. However, we anticipate that our expected operating income rate improvement and annual earnings growth will be realized in the second half of the fiscal year. Our guidance assumes a modest operating income rate decline and no material improvement in net earnings for the first half of the fiscal year. This outlook includes the impact of a continuation of the change in revenue mix, a significant increase in new store openings, higher spending on our services business and call centers, and reduced leverage on expenses in the first half of the fiscal year, which seasonally has lower revenue than the second half. We expect greater benefits in the second half of the fiscal year from leveraging our operating model across more stores and refining our store operating model to improve employee productivity. Additionally, we expect gross profit rate pressure due to the change in revenue mix to moderate in the second half of the fiscal year, amid a more rational promotional environment. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 are expected to be $800 million to $850 million, excluding expenditures associated with acquiring Speakeasy and any additional acquisitions. Of that total, we expect approximately $500 million will support our planned new store openings and various store enhancement projects, including the costs of adding Magnolia Home Theater rooms to additional U.S. Best Buy stores. Specifically, the capital expenditures are expected to support the opening of approximately 90 new U.S. Best Buy stores; up to five Pacific Sales stores; three to five Canada Best Buy stores; seven to nine Future Shop stores; 20 to 23 Five Star stores; and two to three China Best Buy stores. We also anticipate opening test stores in Mexico and Turkey within the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, we anticipate relocating approximately eight U.S. Best Buy stores and approximately two Future Shop stores, and we expect to remodel and enhance certain existing stores. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 also are expected to include approximately $230 million in technology investments intended, among other things, to improve our supply chain and service delivery capabilities, as well as increase our operating efficiencies. During fiscal 2008, we plan to continue our quarterly cash dividend program. We will continue to evaluate the amount of our quarterly dividend based on our strong cash and short term investments position at the end of fiscal 2007, and our cash flows generated during fiscal 2008. We also expect to continue repurchasing our common stock during fiscal 2008 pursuant to the $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2006. There is no stated expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases. We intend to update our annual earnings guidance if we are reasonably confident that annual results are expected to change materially. Subsequent Event Effective May 1, 2007, we acquired Speakeasy for $97 million in cash, including transaction costs, subject to certain post closing adjustments. In connection with this transaction, we also repaid $6 million of Speakeasys debt. We acquired Speakeasy to strengthen our technology portfolio for small business customers, delivered through Best Buy For Business. The acquisition will be accounted for in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 using the purchase method in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the net assets will be recorded at their estimated fair values, and operating results will be included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition. The purchase price will be allocated on a preliminary basis using information currently available. Goodwill is projected to be approximately $75 million and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired will be finalized no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2009, as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date of acquisition. 51 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our debt is not subject to material interest rate volatility risk. The rates on a substantial portion of our debt may be reset, but not more than one percentage point higher than the current rates. If the rates on the debt were to be reset one percentage point higher, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $4 million. We do not manage our debt interest rate volatility risk through the use of derivative instruments. We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International operations. A 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. We do not manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative instruments. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect interest income generated from our short term and long term investments in debt securities. If overall interest rates were one percentage point lower than current rates, our annual interest income would decline by approximately $29 million based on our short term and long term investments as of March 3, 2007. We do not manage our investment interest rate volatility risk through the use of derivative instruments. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. We do not expect any material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks for the foreseeable future. 52
