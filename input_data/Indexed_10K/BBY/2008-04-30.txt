Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe transparency and clarity are the primary goals of successful financial reporting. We remain committed to increasing the transparency of our financial reporting, providing our shareholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial position and operating results. In accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that such control was effective as of March 1, 2008. Managements report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and the related report of our independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in eight sections: Overview Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards Outlook for Fiscal 2009 We consolidate the financial results of our China operations on a two month lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non financial information presented in our MD&A relative to our China operations is also presented on a two month lag. No significant intervening event occurred in our China operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2008. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2008 and 2006 each included 52 weeks, whereas our fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Overview Best Buy is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of all store, call center and online operations, including Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video, Pacific Sales and Speakeasy located within the U.S. and its territories. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, operating 923 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico at the end of fiscal 2008. Best Buy Mobile offers a wide selection of mobile phones, accessories and services through nine stand alone stores located in New York and North Carolina, as well as in 181 U.S. Best Buy stores at the end of fiscal 2008. Geek Squad offers residential and commercial computer repair, support and installation services in all U.S. Best Buy stores and seven stand alone stores at the end of fiscal 2008. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high end audio and video products and related services from 13 stores located in California, Oregon and Washington, as well as through 346 Magnolia Home Theater rooms located in U.S. Best Buy stores at the end of fiscal 2008. Pacific Sales stores offer high end home improvement products including appliances, consumer electronics and related services, operating 19 stores in California at the end of fiscal 2008. Speakeasy provides broadband voice, data and information technology services to home and small business users through a network of experienced sales associates. 29 The International segment is comprised of all Canada store, call center and online operations, including Best Buy, Future Shop and Geek Squad, as well as all China store and online operations, including Best Buy, Five Star and Geek Squad. Our International segment offers products and services similar to our Domestic segments offerings. However, Canada Best Buy stores do not carry appliances, the China Best Buy store and Five Star stores do not carry entertainment software, and Geek Squad services in Canada and China are offered only through our Best Buy stores. At the end of fiscal 2008, we operated 51 Canada Best Buy stores in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan; 131 Future Shop stores throughout all of Canadas provinces; 160 Five Star stores located in seven of Chinas 34 provinces; and one China Best Buy store in Shanghai. In support of our retail store operations, we also operate Web sites for each of our brands (BestBuy.com, BestBuy.ca, BestBuy.com.cn, BestBuyMobile.com, Five Star.cn, FutureShop.ca, GeekSquad.com, GeekSquad.ca, MagnoliaAV.com, PacificSales.com and Speakeasy.net). Our business, like that of many U.S. retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S. and Canada, than in any other fiscal quarter. The timing of new store openings, costs associated with the development of new businesses, as well as general economic conditions may affect our future results. Acquisition Speakeasy, Inc. On May 1, 2007, we acquired Speakeasy, Inc. ("Speakeasy") for $103 million in cash, or $89 million net of cash acquired, which included transaction costs and the repayment of $5 million of Speakeasys debt. We acquired Speakeasy, an independent U.S. broadband, voice, data and information technology services provider, to strengthen our portfolio of technology solutions. The premium we paid, in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired, was primarily for the synergies we believe Speakeasy will generate by providing new technology solutions for our existing and future customers, as well as to obtain Speakeasys skilled, established workforce. Speakeasy contributed revenue of $78 million to our consolidated financial results in fiscal 2008. Financial Reporting Changes To maintain consistency and comparability, we reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, effective March 4, 2007. FIN No. 48 provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. See Note 8, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Our business, broadly defined, is about meeting the wants and needs of consumers. We believe that our assets position us to solve more customer problems than ever. Specifically, our assets include approximately 150,000 engaged employees; valuable relationships with vendors all over the world; continuing and emerging relationships with companies like Apple, Dell and The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC ("CPW"); and all of the other mutually enriching business relationships that our people continue to establish and develop wherever we go, from Asia to Silicon Valley. We also generate significant positive cash flows. All of these assets are at our disposal as we envision how we will deepen our relationships with customers and increase shareholder value. Our business strategy is customer centricity. We define customer centricity through its parts, which we call our three core philosophies: inviting our employees to contribute their unique ideas and experiences in service of customers; treating customers uniquely and honoring their differences; and meeting customers unique needs, end to end. We start with a view of all of our customers, including what their problems are and what their desires are. We try to match that against everything we know about the solutions that now exist, or that could be created. Then we figure out how to get customers the right solutions by 30 using our employees unique capabilities, as well as our network of vendors and other third party providers. If we accomplish what we have set out to do, we believe these solutions may give us something unique in the marketplace, and something truly differentiated. Mass merchants, direct sellers, other specialty retailers and online retailers are increasingly interested in our revenue categories because of rising demand. We believe that by understanding our customers better than our competitors do, and by inspiring our employees to have richer interactions with customers, we can differentiate ourselves and compete more effectively. We further believe that this strategy can be successful for us with a variety of products and services, store formats, customer groups and even countries. We believe that our customer centricity strategy provides the framework to grow and to enhance our business in the future. Examples of new growth areas in the past year include our Best Buy Mobile and Apple store within a store experiences, our introduction of Dell computers to all U.S. Best Buy stores (making us the only U.S. retailer offering all major computing brands), our acquisition of Speakeasy and our entry into Puerto Rico. Our future growth plans include focusing on investments that will quicken our progress in transforming the customer experience. We plan to do this by scaling the Best Buy Mobile store within a store experience to the majority of our U.S. Best Buy stores in the next 18 months. In addition, we plan to invest in approximately 250 additional Apple store within a store locations in the next year and to expand our private label business, which provides customers with an affordable alternative in several product categories such as home theater, computing and MP3. We expect to continue expanding into new product categories such as musical instruments and recreation and plan to increase our market share in existing product categories such as home theater, navigation, mobile phones and gaming by improving our in store and online customer experiences. We plan to focus the in store customer experience on customer value propositions that provide for better and localized product assortments and resets in our store lay out that enhance and highlight products that are generating the most customer interest such as our offerings in gaming, navigation devices, digital SLR cameras and computing. We expect online offerings to include greater assortments which include Best Buy Mobile offerings, online services scheduling, personalized shopping options and auction and outlet sites that offer more favorable pricing. Members of Reward Zone, our customer loyalty program, will also see increased benefits and program offerings in the next year with rewards becoming even greater the more they shop with us. Our plans in fiscal 2009 also include significant investments internationally as we prepare to enter Mexico and Turkey and to expand further in China. These investments include real estate, personnel, training and enhanced information, supply chain and customer analytic systems. Our continuing plans for international expansion have been thoughtfully managed and we plan to offer tailored market assortments at optimum prices in each country we enter. We anticipate expanding our private label business to other retailers internationally, including retailers in countries where we do not have a footprint presently. We plan to grow and to optimize our Canada business by implementing labor model changes at Future Shop, expanding financial services and broadening our loyalty program given the success we have had in the U.S. We believe the growth we are planning for in Canada will help offset our international investments in fiscal 2009. Not only are we executing on organic growth drivers, we are evaluating options to leverage our existing relationship with CPW, as well as considering potential new relationships to support our international expansion. Results of Operations Fiscal 2008 Summary Net earnings in fiscal 2008 increased 2% to slightly more than $1.4 billion, or $3.12 per diluted share, compared with nearly $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007. The modest increase in net earnings was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in our selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") rate, offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate and a higher effective income tax rate. The increase in net earnings per diluted share was due primarily to the lower average number of shares outstanding, resulting from our share repurchases in fiscal 2008. Revenue in fiscal 2008 increased 11% to $40.0 billion. The increase reflected market share gains and was driven by the net addition of 137 new stores during fiscal 2008; a 2.9% comparable store sales gain; the 31 non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Five Star, Pacific Sales and Speakeasy; and favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the impact of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.5% of revenue to 23.9% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin products, including increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower gross profit rate than our other operations, reduced our gross profit rate by approximately 0.2% of revenue in fiscal 2008. Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.3% of revenue to 18.5% of revenue. The improvement was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 11% growth in revenue and store operating model improvements. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our other operations, reduced our SG&A rate by approximately 0.1% of revenue in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we added the Apple store within a store experience to 357 new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores, the Best Buy Mobile store within a store experience to 181 new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores and 44 Magnolia Home Theater rooms to new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores, bringing the total number of Magnolia Home Theater rooms to 346 at the end of fiscal 2008. Effective with the cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 30%, to $0.13 per common share. During fiscal 2008, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.46 per common share, or $204 million in the aggregate. During fiscal 2008, we purchased and retired 75.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $3.5 billion pursuant to our share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2008, we and The Best Buy Childrens Foundation contributed approximately $32 million to local communities. The Best Buy Childrens Foundation supports educational programs that integrate and leverage todays technology. Consolidated Results The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Consolidated Performance Summary 2008 2007(1) 2006 Revenue $ 40,023 $ 35,934 $ 30,848 Revenue gain % 11 % 16 % 12 % Comparable store sales % gain(2) 2.9 % 5.0 % 4.9 % Gross profit as % of revenue 23.9 % 24.4 % 25.0 % SG&A as % of revenue 18.5 % 18.8 % 19.7 % Operating income $ 2,161 $ 1,999 $ 1,644 Operating income as % of revenue 5.4 % 5.6 % 5.3 % Net earnings $ 1,407 $ 1,377 $ 1,140 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.12 $ 2.79 $ 2.27 (1)Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2008 and 2006 each included 52 weeks. (2)Comprised of revenue at stores, call centers and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. Fiscal 2008 Results Compared With Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 net earnings were slightly more than $1.4 billion, or $3.12 per diluted share, compared with nearly $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007. The modest increase in net earnings was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in our SG&A rate, offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate and a higher effective income tax rate. The increase in net earnings per 32 diluted share was due primarily to the lower average number of shares outstanding, resulting from our share repurchases in fiscal 2008. Revenue in fiscal 2008 increased 11% to $40.0 billion, compared with $35.9 billion in fiscal 2007. The increase resulted primarily from the net addition of 137 new Best Buy, Future Shop, Five Star, Pacific Sales and Best Buy Mobile stores during fiscal 2008, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2007, a 2.9% comparable store sales gain and the non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Five Star, Pacific Sales and Speakeasy. The remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2007, the net addition of new stores during the past fiscal year accounted for more than one half of the revenue increase in fiscal 2008; the comparable store sales gain accounted for more than two tenths of the revenue increase; the non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Five Star, Pacific Sales and Speakeasy accounted for more than one tenth of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table presents consolidated revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2008 and 2007: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary(1) Year Ended Year Ended March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 Consumer electronics 41 % 42 % (1.3 )% 9.1 % Home office 28 % 27 % 7.1 % 0.0 % Entertainment software 19 % 18 % 7.9 % 3.2 % Appliances 6 % 6 % (2.6 )% (0.8 )% Services(2) 6 % 6 % 5.5 % 9.5 % Other(3) &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 2.9 % 5.0 % (1)Comprised of revenue at stores, call centers and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations.

Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. (2)Services consists primarily of commissions from the sale of extended service contracts; revenue from computer related services; product repair revenue; and delivery and installation revenue derived from home theater, mobile audio and appliances. (3)Other includes revenue, such as fees received from cardholder account activations, that is recognized over time, resulting in revenue recognition that is not indicative of sales activity in the current period. Other also includes gift card breakage. These revenue types are excluded from our comparable store sales calculation. Finally, other includes revenue from the sale of products that are not related to our core offerings. For these reasons, we do not provide a comparable store sales metric for this revenue category. Our comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2008 benefited from a higher average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in higher ticket items, including video gaming hardware, flat panel televisions and notebook computers. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2008 comparable store sales gain included video gaming hardware and software, notebook computers, flat panel televisions and navigation products. An increase in online purchases also contributed to the fiscal 2008 comparable store sales gain. Revenue from our online operations increased more than 25% in fiscal 2008 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.5% of revenue to 23.9% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin products, including increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower gross profit rate than our other operations, reduced our gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 by approximately 0.2% of revenue. These factors were partially offset by better promotional programs in home theater, as well as lower financing rates and Reward Zone costs. 33 Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.3% of revenue to 18.5% of revenue. The improvement was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 11% growth in revenue and store operating model improvements. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our other operations, reduced our SG&A rate by approximately 0.1% of revenue in fiscal 2008. Because retailers do not uniformly record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financials Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal 2007 Results Compared With Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2007 net earnings were nearly $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, compared with just over $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in our SG&A rate. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate and a higher effective income tax rate. Net earnings in fiscal 2007 also benefited from net interest income of $111 million, compared with net interest income of $77 million in fiscal 2006. Revenue in fiscal 2007 increased 16% to $35.9 billion, compared with $30.8 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase resulted primarily from the net addition of 87 new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during fiscal 2007, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2006, a 5.0% comparable store sales gain, and the acquisitions of Five Star and Pacific Sales. The remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007, the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and income related to our recognition of additional gift card breakage from prior years. The addition of new Best Buy and Future Shop stores accounted for nearly four tenths of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007; the comparable store sales gain accounted for three tenths of the revenue increase; the acquisitions of Five Star and Pacific Sales accounted for nearly two tenths of the revenue increase; the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007 accounted for one tenth of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as income related to our recognition of additional gift card breakage from prior years. Our comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2007 benefited from a higher average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in higher ticket items, including flat panel televisions and notebook computers. In addition, comparable store sales were driven by continued customer demand for and the increased affordability of these products, as strong unit volume growth was somewhat muted by declines in average selling prices. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2007 comparable store sales gain included flat panel televisions, notebook computers, video gaming hardware and software and MP3 players and accessories. An increase in online purchases also contributed to the fiscal 2007 comparable store sales gain, as we continued to add features and capabilities to our Web sites. Revenue from our online operations increased approximately 36% in fiscal 2007 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.6% of revenue to 24.4% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a lower margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Also contributing to the decrease, in order of impact, were a more promotional environment in the consumer electronics and home office revenue categories, and the inclusion of our China operations for a portion of the year. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower gross profit rate than our other operations, reduced our gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 by approximately 0.2% of revenue. Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.9% of revenue to 18.8% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 16% growth in revenue and reduced performance based incentive compensation. Also contributing to the decrease, in order of impact, were controlled expenses related to our strategic initiatives and expense reduction efforts. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our other operations, reduced our SG&A rate by approximately 0.1% of revenue in fiscal 2007. These factors were partially offset by expenses related to increased asset impairments, litigation and business closure costs. 34 Segment Performance Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Domestic Segment Performance Summary 2008 2007(1)(2) 2006 Revenue $ 33,328 $ 31,031 $ 27,380 Revenue gain % 7 % 13 % 11 % Comparable store sales % gain(3) 1.9 % 4.1 % 5.1 % Gross profit as % of revenue 24.5 % 24.8 % 25.3 % SG&A as % of revenue 18.5 % 18.7 % 19.5 % Operating income $ 1,999 $ 1,900 $ 1,588 Operating income as % of revenue 6.0 % 6.1 % 5.8 % (1)Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks.

As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. Fiscal 2008 Results Compared With Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, our Domestic segments operating income was $2.0 billion, or 6.0% of revenue, compared with $1.9 billion, or 6.1% of revenue, in fiscal 2007. The Domestic segments operating income rate in fiscal 2008 benefited from revenue gains and an improvement in the SG&A rate, partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segments revenue in fiscal 2008 increased 7% to $33.3 billion. Excluding the impact of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007, revenue increased 9% in fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of the extra week, the net addition of new stores accounted for nearly eight tenths of the revenue increase in fiscal 2008; the 1.9% comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly two tenths of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due to the non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Speakeasy. The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2008 and 2007: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary(1) Year Ended Year Ended March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 Consumer electronics 41 % 42 % (2.4 )% 8.3 % Home office 28 % 27 % 7.0 % (1.2 )% Entertainment software 20 % 19 % 6.1 % 2.4 % Appliances 5 % 6 % (5.0 )% (1.7 )% Services(2) 6 % 5 % 4.1 % 9.0 % Other(3) &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 1.9 % 4.1 % (1)Comprised of revenue at stores, call centers and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations.

Other also includes gift card breakage. These revenue types are excluded from our comparable store sales calculation. Finally, other includes revenue from the sale of products that are not related to our core offerings. For these reasons, we do not provide a comparable store sales metric for this revenue category. Our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2008 benefited from a higher average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in sales of higher ticket items, including video gaming hardware, flat panel televisions and notebook computers. Also contributing to the fiscal 2008 comparable store sales gain was an increase in online purchases, as we continued to add features and capabilities to our Web sites, including the launch of a Spanish language version of BestBuy.com and the ability of our loyalty club members to redeem Reward Zone certificates online. Revenue from our Domestic segments online operations increased approximately 30% in fiscal 2008 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our Domestic segments consumer electronics revenue category posted a 2.4% comparable store sales decline, driven by declines in tube and projection televisions and MP3 players and accessories, which was offset by gains in the sales of flat panel televisions and navigation products. A 7.0% comparable store sales gain in our Domestic segments home office revenue category was driven primarily by increased sales of notebook computers. The comparable store sales gain was partially offset by declines in the sales of desktop computers, printers and monitors. Our Domestic segments entertainment software revenue category recorded a 6.1% comparable store sales gain due primarily to sales growth in video gaming hardware and software, fueled by increased availability of hardware and greater selection of software. The comparable store sales gain was partially offset by continued declines in sales of CDs and DVDs. A 5.0% comparable store sales decline in our Domestic segments appliances revenue category was driven primarily by declines in sales of major appliances and small electrics due to soft macro economic conditions in the housing sector. Our Domestic segments services revenue category recorded a 4.1% comparable store sales gain due primarily to sales growth in home theater installation and computer services, partially offset by declines in sales of extended service contracts. Our Domestic segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.3% of revenue to 24.5% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a lower margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from video gaming hardware and notebook computers. These declines were partially offset by better promotional spending in home theater, music and movies, as well as lower financing rates and Reward Zone costs. Our Domestic segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.2% of revenue to 18.5% of revenue. The improvement was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 7% growth in revenue and store operating model improvements, which includes labor efficiencies and operating procedure changes.

Note: During fiscal 2007, we relocated 13 U.S. Best Buy stores. No other store in the Domestic segment was relocated during fiscal 2007. At the end of fiscal 2007, we operated 822 U.S. Best Buy stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia; 14 Pacific Sales stores in California; 20 Magnolia Audio Video stores in California, Oregon and Washington; five Best Buy Mobile stores in New York; and 12 U.S. Geek Squad stores in California, Colorado, Georgia, Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin. Fiscal 2007 Results Compared With Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, our Domestic segments operating income was $1.9 billion, or 6.1% of revenue, compared with $1.6 billion, or 5.8% of revenue, in fiscal 2006. The Domestic segments operating income rate in fiscal 2007 benefited from revenue gains and a decrease in the SG&A rate, partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segments revenue in fiscal 2007 increased 13% to $31.0 billion. The addition of new stores accounted for nearly one half of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007; a 4.1% comparable store sales gain accounted for approximately three tenths of the revenue increase; the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007 accounted for just over one tenth of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Pacific Sales and income related to our recognition of additional gift card breakage from prior years. Our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2007 benefited from a higher average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in higher ticket items, including flat panel televisions and notebook computers. Also contributing to the fiscal 2007 comparable store sales gain was an increase in online purchases, as we continued to add features and capabilities to our Web sites. Revenue from our Domestic segments online operations increased approximately 39% in fiscal 2007 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our Domestic segments consumer electronics revenue category posted an 8.3% comparable store sales gain, driven by sales of flat panel televisions and MP3 players and accessories, partially offset by declines in tube and projection televisions. Comparable store sales gains from flat panel television unit volume growth and increased screen size were somewhat muted by declines in average selling prices. Our Domestic segments home office revenue category recorded a 1.2% comparable store sales decrease, driven primarily by declines in desktop computers and printers. The comparable store sales declines were partially offset by growth in notebook computers, reflecting continued consumer demand for portable technology. A 2.4% comparable store sales gain in our Domestic segments entertainment software revenue category was due primarily to sales growth in video gaming, driven by the increased affordability of existing platforms, as well as the launches of Sony Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii. The comparable store sales gains were partially offset by continued declines in sales of new music and movie releases. A 1.7% comparable store sales decline in our Domestic segments appliances revenue category was driven primarily by declines in sales of small electrics. 37 Comparable store sales of major appliances were flat in fiscal 2007, as benefits from the expansion of our improved appliance assortments were offset by a softer housing market. A 9.0% comparable store sale gain in our Domestic segments services revenue category was driven primarily by sales growth in home theater installation and computer services partially offset by declines in the sales of extended service contracts. Our Domestic segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.5% of revenue to 24.8% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a lower margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Also contributing to the decrease was a more promotional environment in the consumer electronics and home office revenue categories. Our Domestic segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.8% of revenue to 18.7% of revenue. The improvement was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 13% growth in revenue and reduced performance based incentive compensation. Also contributing to the improvement, in order of impact, were controlled expenses related to our strategic initiatives and expense reduction efforts. These factors were partially offset by expenses related to increased asset impairments, litigation and business closure costs.

The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. Fiscal 2008 Results Compared With Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, our International segments operating income was $162 million, or 2.4% of revenue, compared with $99 million, or 2.0% of revenue, in fiscal 2007. The increase in our International segments operating income resulted primarily from revenue gains and a significant improvement in the SG&A rate. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate. Our International segments revenue increased 37% to $6.7 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with $4.9 billion in fiscal 2007. Excluding the impact of the extra week of business in fiscal 2007, revenue increased 38% in fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of the extra week, the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for slightly more than three tenths of the revenue increase; the non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Five Star accounted for nearly three tenths of the revenue increase; the 9.0% comparable store sales gain accounted for more than two tenths of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due to the net addition of new Future Shop and Best Buy stores in Canada and new Five Star stores in China during the past fiscal year. Revenue from our International segments online operations increased approximately 12% in fiscal 2008 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. 38  The following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2008 and 2007: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary(1) Year Ended Year Ended March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 Consumer electronics 39 % 41 % 5.4 % 15.7 % Home office 30 % 32 % 7.7 % 7.4 % Entertainment software 13 % 12 % 23.7 % 11.3 % Appliances 13 % 10 % 6.5 % 8.0 % Services(2) 5 % 5 % 14.7 % 13.8 % Other(3) &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 9.0 % 11.7 % (1)Comprised of revenue at stores, call centers and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations.

Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. (2)Services consists primarily of commissions from the sale of extended service contracts; revenue from computer related services; product repair revenue; and delivery and installation revenue derived from home theater, mobile audio and appliances. (3)Other includes gift card breakage, which is excluded from our calculation of comparable store sales. Other also includes revenue associated with Canadas private label credit card program and revenue from the sale of products that are not related to our core offerings. For these reasons, we do not provide a comparable store sales metric for this revenue category. Our International segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2008 reflected an increase in the average transaction amount, which was driven by continued growth in the sales of higher priced products. The products having the largest positive effect on our International segments comparable store sales gain were video gaming hardware and software, flat panel televisions, notebook computers and navigation products. Growth in the sales of these products was partially offset by comparable store sales declines in projection and tube televisions, computer software and CDs. In fiscal 2008, our International segments consumer electronics revenue category posted a 5.4% comparable store sales gain resulting primarily from gains in the sales of flat panel televisions, navigation products and digital cameras, partially offset by declines in the sales of tube and projection televisions and MP3 players and accessories. The home office revenue category posted a 7.7% comparable store sales gain, which resulted from comparable store sales gains in notebook and desktop computers, partially offset by a decline in the sales of cellular phones. The entertainment software revenue category recorded a 23.7% comparable store sales gain reflecting an increase in the sales of video gaming hardware and software, partially offset by an expected decline in the sales of computer software and CDs. The appliances revenue category recorded a 6.5% comparable store sales gain resulting primarily from increases in the sales of appliances in our Five Star operations, where appliances represent a larger percentage of the sales and whose results were included in the comparable store sales figures for the first time in fiscal 2008. Our services revenue category posted a 14.7% comparable store sales gain due primarily to an increase in revenue from our product repair business. Our International segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.9% of revenue to 20.7% of revenue. Our China operations, which operate at a significantly lower gross profit rate than our Canada operations, reduced our International segments gross profit rate by approximately 0.7% of revenue in fiscal 2008. The remainder of the decrease in our International segments gross profit rate was due primarily to the increased sales of lower margin products in both our Canada and China operations, which was partially offset by rate improvements in certain product categories as well as lower financing costs in Canada. 39 Our International segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 1.3% of revenue to 18.3% of revenue. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our Canada operations, reduced our International segments SG&A rate by approximately 0.5% of revenue in fiscal 2008. The remainder of the improvement in our International segments SG&A rate was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 37% growth in revenue and continued focus on SG&A optimization initiatives. Partially offsetting the decrease were continued costs incurred for infrastructure investments in China, the build out of an international support team and the start up costs for entry into Mexico and Turkey.

Fiscal 2007 Results Compared With Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2007 amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation, which allocates to the International segment certain SG&A support costs previously reported as part of the Domestic segment. In fiscal 2007, our International segments operating income was $99 million, or 2.0% of revenue, compared with $56 million, or 1.6% of revenue, in fiscal 2006. The increase in our International segments operating income resulted primarily from revenue gains and a significant reduction in the SG&A rate. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate. Our International segments revenue increased 41% to $4.9 billion in fiscal 2007, compared with $3.5 billion in fiscal 2006. The acquisition of Five Star accounted for nearly four tenths of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007; the 11.7% comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly three tenths of the revenue increase; the addition of new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for just over one tenth of the revenue increase; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 40 rates accounted for just over one tenth of the revenue increase; and the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007 accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase. We believe the comparable store sales increase reflected market share gains and was driven by increased sales of flat panel televisions, video gaming hardware and software and notebook computers, partially offset by declines in tube and projection televisions. Our International segment reported comparable store sales increases in fiscal 2007 in the consumer electronics, home office, entertainment software, appliances and services revenue categories of 15.7%, 7.4%, 11.3%, 8.0% and 13.8%, respectively. Revenue from our International segments online operations increased approximately 19% and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our International segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 1.3% of revenue to 21.6% of revenue. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower gross profit rate than our Canada operations, reduced our International segments gross profit rate by approximately 1.1% of revenue in fiscal 2007. The remainder of the decrease in our International segments gross profit rate was due primarily to increased financing costs, resulting from increased borrowing rates and a shift towards longer term financing programs in conjunction with strong flat panel television sales. Our International segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 1.7% of revenue to 19.6% of revenue. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our Canada operations, reduced our International segments SG&A rate by approximately 0.7% of revenue in fiscal 2007. The remainder of the improvement in our International segments SG&A rate was due primarily to, in order of impact, the leveraging effect of the 41% growth in revenue; improvements in the labor model used in our Canada Best Buy stores; reduced Canada headquarters payroll costs at the end of fiscal 2006; and the leveraging effect of the 11.7% comparable store sales gain on advertising expense as a percentage of revenue. These factors were partially offset by a performance driven increase in incentive based compensation, expenses incurred related to the closure of all six Canada Geek Squad stand alone stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and increased asset impairment charges. Additional Consolidated Results Other Income (Expense) Our investment income and other in fiscal 2008 decreased to $129 million, compared with $162 million in fiscal 2007 and $107 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due to the impact of lower average cash and investment balances, as investments were liquidated to fund our ASR program in fiscal 2008 and a one time $20 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in fiscal 2007. The change in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to higher investment yields and the $20 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in fiscal 2007. Interest expense in fiscal 2008 increased to $62 million, compared with $31 million and $30 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and 2006 was due primarily to borrowings under our credit facilities related to the funding of the ASR program in fiscal 2008. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate increased to 36.6% in fiscal 2008, compared with 35.3% in fiscal 2007 and 33.7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a reduced tax benefit from foreign operations, lower tax exempt interest income and an increase in state income taxes. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a change in the composition of taxable income between foreign and domestic entities. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products affect our ability to increase our gross profit rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We ended fiscal 2008 with $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, compared with 41 $3.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2007. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $0.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2008, down from $2.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2007. The decreases in cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and working capital were due primarily to the liquidation of a substantial portion of our investment portfolio to repay debt and to fund our ASR program. In addition, at March 1, 2008, we reclassified $417 million (par value) of our short term investments in auction rate securities to non current assets within equity and other investments in our consolidated balance sheet given the uncertainty of when these investments can be successfully liquidated at par as a result of the current market failures for auction rate securities as described below. In accordance with our investment policy, we invest with issuers who have high quality credit and limit the amount of investment exposure to any one issuer. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain a desired level of liquidity to meet working capital needs. We seek to preserve principal and minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. All investment debt securities we own are investment grade. We do not have any investments in securities that are collateralized by assets that include mortgages or subprime debt. The vast majority of our investments in auction rate securities are AAA/Aaa rated and collateralized by student loans, which are guaranteed 95% to 100% by the U.S. government. Until February 2008, the market for auction rate securities was highly liquid. Beginning February 11, 2008, a substantial number of auctions began to fail as the amount of securities submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded the aggregate amount of the bids. Substantially all of our auction rate securities portfolio at March 1, 2008, has been subject to failed auctions. For each unsuccessful auction, the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for each security. To date, we have collected all interest due on our auction rate securities and expect to continue to do so in the future. Since March 1, 2008 and through April 25, 2008, we have liquidated $20 million of auction rate securities at par value. At April 25, 2008, our auction rate securities portfolio was $397 million (par value). The principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, or final payments come due according to the contractual maturities of the debt issues, which range from 8 to 40 years. We believe that the credit quality of our auction rate securities is high and that we will ultimately recover all amounts invested in these securities. We do not believe the current illiquidity of these investments will have a material impact on our ability to execute our business plans as described below in the Outlook for Fiscal 2009 section of this MD&A. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash and investments in debt securities that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and warranty programs. Restricted cash and investments in debt securities totaled $408 million and $382 million at March 1, 2008, and March 3, 2007, respectively, and were included in other current assets or equity and other investments. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,025 $ 1,762 $ 1,740 Investing activities 1,464 (780 ) (754 ) Financing activities (3,378 ) (513 ) (619 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 122 (12 ) 27 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 233 $ 457 $ 394 42 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with $1.8 billion in fiscal 2007 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006. The changes were due primarily to increases in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were due primarily to changes in accrued income taxes, accounts payable, other liabilities and merchandise inventories. The decrease in cash used for accrued income taxes resulted mainly from the timing of tax payments. The increase in cash used for accounts payable and other liabilities was due primarily to the timing of vendor payments. The modest increase in cash used for merchandise inventories was due primarily to investments in key product categories, such as notebook computers and video gaming hardware and software. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with cash used in investing activities of $780 million in fiscal 2007 and $754 million in fiscal 2006. The change in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2008, compared with cash used in fiscal 2007, was due to an increase in the net sales of investments of approximately $2.1 billion and a decrease in cash used in acquisition activities. We liquidated a substantial portion of our investment portfolio in fiscal 2008 in order to repay debt incurred to fund our ASR program. We acquired Speakeasy for $89 million in fiscal 2008. We acquired Pacific Sales and Five Star in fiscal 2007 for a combined total of $421 million. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 increased modestly to $797 million, compared to $733 million in fiscal 2007. Refer to Capital Expenditures below for additional information. In fiscal 2008, we used cash for the construction of new retail locations, information systems and other store projects, including expansions and remodels. The primary purposes of our capital expenditures were to support our expansion plans and improve our operational efficiency. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $3.4 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with $513 million and $619 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. The change in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007, was due primarily to an increase in repurchases of our common stock. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased $3.5 billion of our common stock, compared with $599 million in fiscal 2007. Proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, were $133 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $12 million in fiscal 2007 and net repayments of $33 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2008, we engaged in various debt financing activities as a result of our ASR program, including terminating our previous $200 million bank revolving credit facility, borrowing $2.5 billion under a bridge loan facility, terminating and repaying the bridge loan facility, and entering into a $2.5 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility. Sources of Liquidity Our most significant sources of liquidity continue to be funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments. We believe funds generated from the expected results of operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments will be sufficient to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives for the next fiscal year. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities. In September 2007, we entered into a $2.5 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement permits borrowings up to $2.5 billion, and may be increased up to $3.0 billion at our option and upon the consent of the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement and each of the banks providing an incremental credit commitment. The Credit Agreement has a $300 million letter of credit sub limit and a $200 million foreign currency sub limit. The Credit Agreement expires in September 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at rates specified in the agreement. At March 1, 2008, $120 million in borrowings was outstanding and $2.4 billion was available under the Credit Agreement. Amounts outstanding under letters of credit may reduce amounts available under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require 43 us to maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum quarterly interest coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary default provisions including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants. We also have inventory financing facilities through which certain suppliers receive payments from a designated finance company on invoices we owe them. At March 1, 2008, and March 3, 2007, $26 million and $39 million, respectively, were outstanding and included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets; and $215 million and $196 million, respectively, were available for use under these inventory financing facilities. Our International segment has a $25 million revolving demand facility for our Canada operations, of which $20 million is available from February through July, and $25 million is available from August through January of each year. There is no set expiration date for this facility. All borrowings under this facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility for any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit and letters of guarantee reduced amounts available under this facility to $19 million and $16 million, at March 1, 2008, and March 3, 2007, respectively. Our International segment also has $86 million in revolving demand facilities to finance working capital requirements for our China operations. The facilities are renewed annually with the respective banks. An aggregate of $36 million in borrowings was outstanding under these facilities at March 1, 2008. Certain borrowings are secured by a guarantee of Best Buy Co., Inc. and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreements. Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At March 1, 2008, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In the event we were to default on any of our other debt, it would constitute a default under our credit facilities as well. An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in Exhibit No. 12.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, was 8.9 and 10.3 in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our credit ratings at April 25, 2008, were as follows: Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch BBB+ Stable Moodys Baa2 Stable Standard & Poors BBB Stable Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and vendor financing terms, and ultimately result in higher long term lease costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible subordinated debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be significantly downgraded. Capital Expenditures A component of our long term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2008, we invested $797 million in property and equipment, including opening 155 new stores; adding Best Buy Mobile, Apple and Magnolia Home Theater store within a store experiences inside new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores; expanding and remodeling existing stores; and upgrading our information technology systems. Capital expenditures are funded through cash provided by operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Refer to the Outlook for Fiscal 2009 section of this MD&A for information on our capital expenditure plans in fiscal 2009. 44 The following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 New stores $ 267 $ 253 $ 244 Store related projects(1) 222 251 206 Information technology 259 121 115 Other 49 108 83 Total capital expenditures $ 797 $ 733 $ 648 (1)Includes store remodels and expansions, as well as various merchandising projects. Debt and Capital In January 2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402 million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 million in offering expenses, were $396 million. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at par, at our option, for cash on or after January 15, 2007. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15, 2012, and January 15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. On January 15, 2007, holders had the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. However, no debentures were so purchased. The debentures become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30 trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. During a portion of fiscal 2007, our closing stock price exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20 trading days in a 30 day trading period. Therefore, debenture holders had the option to convert their debentures into shares of our common stock. However, no debentures were so converted. Due to changes in the price of our common stock, the debentures were no longer convertible at the holders option at March 3, 2007, and have not been convertible through April 25, 2008. The debentures have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July 15, 2011, and July 15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the convertible debentures. At the end of fiscal 2008, $197 million was outstanding under financing lease obligations. Share Repurchases and Dividends From time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity based incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital structure. In June 2007, our Board authorized a $5.5 billion share repurchase program. The program, which became effective on June 26, 2007, terminated and replaced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2006. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases under the June 2007 share repurchase program. Prior to termination of the June 2006 share repurchase program, we purchased and retired 9.8 million shares at a cost of $461 million under the June 2006 program in fiscal 2008. The June 2006 share repurchase program, which became effective June 21, 2006, terminated and replaced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in April 2005. 45 The April 2005 share repurchase program, which became effective on April 27, 2005, terminated and replaced a $500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2004. In accordance with our June 2007 share repurchase program, on June 26, 2007, we entered into an ASR program authorized by the Board. The ASR program consisted of two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock from Goldman for an aggregate purchase price of $3.0 billion. The ASR program concluded in February 2008. Total aggregate shares repurchased under the ASR program were 65.8 million shares at an average purchase price of $45.59 per share. At the end of fiscal 2008, $2.5 billion of the $5.5 billion authorized by our Board was available for future share repurchases under the June 2007 share repurchase program. During fiscal 2007, we purchased and retired 5.6 million shares at a cost of $267 million under the June 2006 share repurchase program, and 6.2 million shares at a cost of $332 million under the April 2005 share repurchase program. During fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 16.5 million shares at a cost of $711 million under the April 2005 share repurchase program, and 1.8 million shares at a cost of $61 million under the June 2004 share repurchase program. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved by our Board under the June 2007 share repurchase program, we do not expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity. In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 9%, to $0.08 per share per quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 25% to $0.10 per share per quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 30% to $0.13 per share per quarter. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2008, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.46 per share, or $204 million in the aggregate. During fiscal 2008, we spent a total of $3.7 billion for share repurchases and dividend payments. Other Financial Measures Our debt to capitalization ratio, which represents the ratio of total debt, including the current portion of long term debt, to total capitalization (total debt plus total shareholders equity), increased to 15% at the end of fiscal 2008, compared with 9% at the end of fiscal 2007. The increase was due primarily to the impact of our share repurchases, which increased debt and decreased shareholders equity. We view our debt to capitalization ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), was 60% at the end of fiscal 2008, compared with 49% at the end of fiscal 2007. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is considered a non GAAP financial measure and is not in accordance with, or preferable to, the ratio determined in accordance with GAAP. However, we have included this information as we believe that our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is important for understanding our operations and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations, and to fund our future growth. In addition, we believe our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owners desire to own or to 46 lease the location, and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is our debt to capitalization ratio. Our debt to capitalization ratio excludes capitalized operating lease obligations in both the numerator and denominator of the calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations ($ in millions): 2008 2007 Debt (including current portion) $ 816 $ 650 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense)(1) 5,902 5,401 Total debt (including capitalized operating lease obligations) $ 6,718 $ 6,051 Debt (including current portion) $ 816 $ 650 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense)(1) 5,902 5,401 Total shareholders equity 4,484 6,201 Adjusted capitalization $ 11,202 $ 12,252 Debt to capitalization ratio 15 % 9 % Adjusted debt to capitalization ratio (including capitalized operating lease obligations) 60 % 49 % (1)The multiple of eight times rental expense used to calculate our total capitalized operating lease obligations is the multiple used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. We have financed a portion of our new store development program through sale leaseback transactions. These transactions involve selling stores to unrelated parties and then leasing the stores back. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with GAAP. A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the "Contractual Obligations" section below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item 2, Properties, and Note 6, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Short term debt obligations $ 156 $ 156 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations 412 9 403 Capital lease obligations 51 14 21 2 14 Financing lease obligations 197 18 38 42 99 Interest payments 217 31 47 36 103 Operating lease obligations(1) 6,832 772 1,477 1,301 3,282 Purchase obligations(2)(3) 2,333 1,311 930 89 3 Unrecognized tax benefits(4) 261 Deferred compensation(5) 74 Total $ 10,533 $ 2,302 $ 2,522 $ 1,873 $ 3,501 Note: For additional information refer to Note 4, Debt; Note 6, Leases; Note 8, Income Taxes and Note 10, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 47 (1)Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $1.8 billion at March 1, 2008. (2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days. (3)We have a contractual commitment to acquire the remaining 25% interest in Five Star within the next several years, subject to Chinese government approval. Due to uncertainties concerning the purchase amount, timing and ability to obtain the necessary governmental approval of the acquisition, this commitment is excluded from the table. (4)Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, which we adopted on March 4, 2007. As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table. (5)Included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at March 1, 2008, was a $74 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table. 48  Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory Reserves We value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss reserves. Our markdown reserve represents the excess of the carrying value, typically average cost, over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis. Our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, we reserve for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis. Our markdown reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. Our inventory loss reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our markdown or inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown reserve. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdown reserve at March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $4 million in fiscal 2008. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss reserve. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2008. 49 Vendor Allowances We receive funds from vendors for various programs, primarily as reimbursements for costs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and sales incentives. Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All other vendor allowances are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Based on the provisions of our vendor agreements, we develop vendor fund accrual rates by estimating the point at which we will have completed our performance under the agreement and the deferred amounts will be earned. During the year, due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical trends to ensure the deferred amounts earned are appropriately recorded. As a part of these analyses, we apply rates negotiated with our vendors to actual purchase volumes to determine the amount of funds accrued and receivable from the vendor. Certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to record vendor receivables in the past three fiscal years. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially impact, positively or negatively, our gross profit rate and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities are collected within two months, and all amounts deferred against inventory turnover within the following fiscal year, and therefore do not require subjective long term estimates. Adjustments to gross profit rate and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material. A 10% difference in our vendor receivables at March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $19 million in fiscal 2008. Long Lived Assets Long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 50 Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. The carrying value of goodwill at March 1, 2008, was $1.1 billion. The carrying value of tradenames at March 1, 2008, was $97 million. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Effective March 4, 2007, we adopted FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. We reported the cumulative effect of $13 million related to the adoption of FIN No. 48 as a decrease to retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2008. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 51 Revenue Recognition See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores, through our Web sites and through selected third parties. A liability is initially established for the cash value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote ("gift card breakage"). We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which show that after 24 months, we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. We have a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn points for each purchase completed at any of our Best Buy stores in the U.S., Canada and China, through our BestBuy.com and BestBuy.ca Web sites or when using our customer loyalty program credit card. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at Best Buy stores and Web sites in the U.S. and Canada. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed. Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions regarding and to apply judgment to estimate future sales returns and the amount and timing of gift cards and loyalty program points projected to be redeemed by gift card recipients and members of our loyalty program. Our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns and gift cards or points projected to be redeemed is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to measure sales returns or recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs during the past three fiscal years except for the change made in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 related to gift card breakage income (see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to measure sales returns or recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales return reserve at March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1 million in fiscal 2008. A 10% change in our unredeemed gift card breakage rate at March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million in fiscal 2008. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program liability at March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2008. 52 Costs Associated With Exit Activities We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations that are under long term leases, we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a risk free interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. The liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our location closing liability at March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $2 million in fiscal 2008. Stock Based Compensation We have a stock based compensation plan, which includes non qualified stock options and nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 5, Shareholders Equity, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs. We determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option pricing models. Non qualified stock option awards granted through fiscal 2005 were valued using a Black Scholes model. Non qualified stock option awards granted after fiscal 2005 were primarily valued using a lattice model. We determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Performance based nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2008. 53 Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general liability claims. However, we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. When estimating our self insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries. Annually, management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities. Our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions on an annual basis and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at March 1, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million in fiscal 2008. Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation In accordance with accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. Minority interests proportionate ownership of assets and liabilities are recorded at historical carrying values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventory, identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames, and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three fiscal years, we completed three significant acquisitions. In May 2007, we acquired Speakeasy for $103 million, which included transaction costs and repayment of debt. In June 2006, we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star for $184 million, which included a working capital injection of $122 million and transaction costs. In May 2006, we acquired Pacific Sales for $411 million, which included transaction costs. See Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for the complete purchase price allocation calculations. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 54  New Accounting Standards In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about: how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS No. 161 beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(revised 2007), Business Combinations ("141R"). SFAS No. 141R significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration, preacquisition contingencies, transaction costs, in process research and development and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS No. 141R, changes in an acquired entitys deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact income tax expense. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS No. 141R beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This standard will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. This new consolidation method significantly changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS No. 160 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Companies are not allowed to adopt SFAS No. 159 on a retrospective basis unless they choose early adoption. We adopted SFAS No. 159 on March 2, 2008, and did not elect the fair value option for eligible items that existed at the date of adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157, as originally issued, was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, in December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS157 b, which deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year, as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. We will adopt SFAS No. 157 as it relates to financial assets and liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements and related disclosures, but do not expect SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Outlook for Fiscal 2009 Our outlook for fiscal 2009 is based on information presently available and contains certain assumptions 55 regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our fiscal 2009 results. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward looking statements. As we consider the macroeconomic pressures on the consumer and evaluate the industry business trends, we believe it is prudent to plan for a soft consumer environment in the near term. Looking forward to fiscal 2009, we are projecting annual earnings per diluted share ("EPS") of $3.25 to $3.40, an average increase of 7% as compared to fiscal 2008. We expect the EPS growth to be driven primarily by a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding, a 9% increase in revenue and an unchanged gross profit rate, partially offset by an increase in our SG&A rate. We are projecting that our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 will be in the range of 37.5% to 38.0%. Specifically, we are forecasting revenue of $43 to $44 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with revenue of $40.0 billion in fiscal 2008. We expect the net addition of approximately 140 new stores will drive more than half of the revenue growth. For the fiscal year, we are projecting an increase in comparable store sales of 1% to 3%. Our fiscal 2009 outlook assumes a decline in our operating income rate of 0.3% to 0.4% of revenue, compared with fiscal 2008. The decline in our operating income rate is expected to be driven by an increase in our SG&A rate of 0.3% to 0.4% of revenue due to slower revenue growth combined with continued investment in strategic growth platforms such as Best Buy Mobile and international expansion. Further, we expect our gross profit rate to be unchanged year over year, driven primarily by mix benefits from revenue growth in mobile phones, navigation devices and services to offset the negative mix impact from continued growth in notebook computers and video gaming. We do not provide a specific forecast for quarterly EPS. Given the current environment, we expect that EPS growth in the second half of the year will more than offset modest declines in the first half. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Of that total, we expect approximately $750 million will support our planned new store openings and various store enhancement projects, including the costs of adding the Best Buy Mobile experience to additional U.S. Best Buy stores. Specifically, the capital expenditures are expected to support the opening of 85 to 100 new U.S. Best Buy stores; five to ten Pacific Sales stores; six Canada Best Buy stores; five Future Shop stores; 20 to 25 Five Star stores; and five to eight China Best Buy stores. We also anticipate opening test stores in Mexico and Turkey within the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, we expect to remodel and enhance certain existing stores. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 also are expected to include approximately $300 million in technology investments intended, among other things, to improve our supply chain and customer analytic capabilities, as well as increase our operating efficiencies and support domestic and international growth. During fiscal 2009, we plan to continue our quarterly cash dividend program. We will continue to evaluate the amount of our quarterly dividend based on our cash and short term investments position at the end of fiscal 2008, and our expected cash flows to be generated during fiscal 2009. We also expect to continue repurchasing our common stock during fiscal 2009 pursuant to the $5.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2007, of which $2.5 billion remains available. For the purpose of providing earnings guidance for fiscal 2009, we have assumed that we will repurchase $800 million of our common stock. There is no stated expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases. The actual amount of our fiscal 2009 capital expenditures, share repurchases, and, if any, external investments, all of which add unique capabilities or dimensions to our businesses and support our growth strategy, can vary significantly from planned levels depending on general economic conditions and the opportunities available to us. We intend to update our annual earnings guidance if we are reasonably confident that annual results are expected to change materially from our guidance.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 56 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. We do not manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of any financial or derivative instruments, forward contracts or hedging activities. During fiscal 2008, the U.S. dollar has been generally weaker throughout the year relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. The overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our International segments revenue and net earnings because the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. It is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes; however, the effect on reported revenue and net earnings can be estimated. We estimate that the overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on revenue of approximately $561 million in fiscal 2008. In addition, we estimate that such weakness had a favorable impact of approximately $22 million on net earnings in fiscal 2008. Interest Rate Risk Short term and long term debt At March 1, 2008, our short term and long term debt was comprised primarily of credit facilities and convertible debentures. We do not manage the interest rate risk on our debt through the use of derivative instruments. Our credit facilities are not subject to material interest rate risk. The credit facilities interest rates may be reset due to fluctuations in a market based index, such as the federal funds rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the base rate or prime rate of our lenders. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates of our credit facilities would change our annual pre tax earnings by $2 million. Our convertible debentures are not subject to material interest rate risk. The interest rate on our debentures may be reset but not more than 100 basis points higher than the current rates. If the interest rate on the debentures at March 1, 2008, were to be reset 100 basis points higher, our annual pre tax earnings would decrease by $4 million. Short term and long term investments in debt securities At March 1, 2008, our short term and long term investments were comprised primarily of debt securities, specifically commercial paper and auction rate securities. These investments are not subject to material interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would change our annual pre tax earnings by $5 million. We do not currently manage interest rate risk on our investments through the use of derivative instruments. Other Market Risks Investments in auction rate securities At March 1, 2008, we held $417 million (par value) in investments in auction rate securities and concluded no temporary impairment exists on these securities. Given current conditions in the auction rate securities market as described above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we may incur temporary unrealized losses or other than temporary realized losses in the future if market conditions persist and we are unable to recover the cost of our investments in auction rate securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point loss from the par value of these investments would result in a $4 million impairment. 57
