Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in seven sections: Overview Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards We consolidate the financial results of our Europe, China and Mexico operations on a two month lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non financial information presented in our MD&A relative to these operations is also presented on a two month lag. No significant intervening event occurred in these operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2009. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 each included 52 weeks, whereas our fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Overview Best Buy is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of all store, call center and online operations, including Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video, Napster, Pacific Sales and Speakeasy operations located within the U.S. and its territories. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, operating 1,023 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico at the end of fiscal 2009. Best Buy Mobile offers a wide selection of mobile phones, accessories and services through 38 stand alone stores located in 12 states as well as in all U.S. Best Buy stores at the end of fiscal 2009. Geek Squad offers residential and commercial repair, support and installation services in all U.S. Best Buy stores and six stand alone stores at the end of fiscal 2009. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high end audio and video products and related services from six stores located in California and Washington, as well as through 353 Magnolia Home Theater rooms located in U.S. Best Buy stores at the end of fiscal 2009. Napster is an online provider of digital music. Pacific Sales stores offer high end home improvement products including appliances, consumer electronics and related services, operating 34 stores in Arizona, California and Nevada at the end of fiscal 2009. Speakeasy provides broadband voice, data and information technology services to home and small business users through a network of experienced sales associates. The International segment is comprised of: (i) all Canada store, call center and online operations, including Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile, Future Shop and Geek Squad; (ii) all Europe store, call center and online operations, including The Carphone Warehouse, The Phone House and Geek Squad; (iii) all China store and online operations, including Best Buy, Five Star and Geek Squad; and (iv) all Mexico store operations, including Best Buy and Geek Squad. Our International segment offers products and services similar to those of our U.S. Best Buy stores. However, Best Buy Canada stores do not carry appliances, our Best Buy China stores and Five Star stores do not carry entertainment software, and Geek Squad services are offered only through our Best Buy stores in Canada and China and in select stores in the U.K. and Spain. Further, our store format and offerings in Europe are similar to our Best Buy Mobile format and offerings in the U.S., primarily offering mobile phones and related accessories and services. 34 Table of Contents At the end of fiscal 2009, we operated 2,465 The Carphone Warehouse and The Phone House stores throughout Europe, 58 Best Buy Canada stores, three Best Buy Mobile Canada stores, 139 Future Shop stores in Canada, 164 Five Star stores in China, five Best Buy China stores, and one Best Buy Mexico store. In support of our retail store operations, we also operate Web sites for each of our brands (BestBuy.com, BestBuy.ca, BestBuy.com.cn, espanol.BestBuy.com and BestBuyMobile.com, CarphoneWarehouse.com, Five Star.cn, FutureShop.ca, GeekSquad.com, GeekSquad.ca, MagnoliaAV.com, Napster.com, PacificSales.com, PhoneHouse.com and Speakeasy.net) Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Europe and Canada, than in any other fiscal quarter. The timing of new store openings, costs associated with the development of new businesses, as well as general economic conditions may affect our future results of operations. Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry which indicates the performance of a store by measuring the growth in sales for such store for a particular fiscal period from the stores sales in the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales is comprised of revenue at our stores, call centers and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from our comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The portion of our calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change attributable to our International segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. Acquisitions Best Buy Europe On June 28, 2008, we acquired a 50% stake in Best Buy Europe for $2.2 billion, or $2.1 billion net of cash acquired. Best Buy Europe is our venture with CPW, consisting of CPWs retail and distribution business comprised of more than 2,400 stores, its online and direct business, insurance operations and mobile and fixed line telecommunication businesses. The transaction also included CPWs economic interests in Best Buy Mobile in the U.S. and Geek Squad in the U.K. and Spain. Best Buy Europe is Europes largest independent mobile phone retailer. We made the investment in Best Buy Europe to further our international growth plans and obtain an immediate retail presence in Europe. Napster On October 25, 2008, we completed our acquisition of Napster for $121 million, or $100 million net of cash acquired. Napster is an online provider of digital music. We believe the combined capabilities of our two companies will allow us to build stronger relationships with customers and to expand the number of digital music and entertainment subscribers over an increasing array of devices. Five Star We acquired a 75% interest in Five Star on June 8, 2006, for $184 million, which included a working capital injection of $122 million. At the time of the acquisition, we also entered into an agreement with Five Stars minority shareholders to acquire the remaining 25% interest in Five Star within four years, subject to Chinese government approval. On February 6, 2009, we were granted a business license to acquire the remaining 25% interest in Five Star and our subsequent acquisition converted Five Star into a wholly owned foreign enterprise that is now 100% owned by us. The $190 million purchase price for the 25% interest was primarily based on a previously agreed upon pricing formula. The acquisition furthers our international growth plans and accelerates the integration of Best Buy and Five Star in China. Financial Reporting Changes To maintain consistency and comparability, we reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year 35 Table of Contents presentation as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Our business, broadly defined, is about meeting the wants and needs of our consumers. We believe that our assets position us to solve more customer problems than ever. Specifically, our assets include approximately 155,000 engaged employees; valuable relationships with vendors all over the world; continuing and emerging relationships with companies like Apple, Dell and CPW; and all of the other mutually enriching business relationships that our people continue to establish and develop wherever we go around the world. We also generate significant positive cash flows. All of these assets are at our disposal as we envision how we will deepen our relationships with customers in order to increase shareholder value. Our business strategy is customer centricity. We define customer centricity through its parts, which we call our three core philosophies: inviting our employees to contribute their unique ideas and experiences in service of customers; treating customers uniquely and honoring their differences; and meeting customers unique needs, end to end. We start with a view of all of our customers, including their problems and their desires. We try to match that against everything we know about the solutions that now exist, or that could be created. Then, we determine ways to deliver to customers the right solutions by using our employees unique capabilities, as well as our network of vendors and other third party providers. If we accomplish what we have set out to do, we believe we have offered a truly unique and differentiated solution to the marketplace. Mass merchants, direct sellers, other specialty retailers and online retailers are increasingly interested in our revenue categories because of rising consumer interest. Yet they do not have a strategy of unleashing their employees to understand customers unique needs, and they lack our unique combination of assets, including those mentioned above as well as our stores, Web sites and call centers. We believe that by inspiring our employees to have richer interactions with customers, and understanding our customers better than our competitors do, we can differentiate ourselves and compete more effectively for customers loyalty than either mass merchants or purely online players. We further believe that this strategy can be successful for us with a variety of products and services, store formats, customer groups and even countries. The currently challenging global economy has resulted in our heightened focus on carefully managing expenses and capital expenditures. Accordingly, we have adjusted our new store opening plans, inventory levels and reduced our overall spending at stores, distribution centers and headquarters. Yet great retailers never stop improving their offerings to customers and growing their business. Our future growth plans and strategy revolve around four business priorities in fiscal 2010. These four priorities represent business opportunities where we believe we can navigate the current economic conditions to put us in the strongest possible position to take advantage of economic recovery long term. These priorities are: Grow Market Share. We expect to gain market share locally. We believe we can attract many of the customers of competitors as they close stores and gain a larger share of the spending of our existing customers. Our approach is to focus on the unique needs of each person that walks into our store, visits our Web sites or contacts our call centers, as they seek to harness the productivity, cost, communications and entertainment benefits of the latest technology. We also intend to expand our products and services, enhance our Reward Zone customer loyalty programs and build on our reputation as a solid community citizen with programs such as @15, our teen led social change platform, as well as our recycling programs. Connected Digital Solutions. We plan to help customers transition to a connected digital lifestyle, where they can seamlessly create, access and share content on the three main screens that are integral to so many lives today: the mobile phone, computer and television. This work includes providing access to a wide selection of digital content and applications, offering simple solutions and letting customers choose both how they want to engage with us and how they manage their digital experiences. International Growth. We believe our strategy of customer centricity has global application, and that by expanding internationally, we can learn and adapt much more quickly and share best practices across the globe. In fiscal 2010, we plan to place less emphasis on new store openings in our 13 countries of operation outside the U.S. Instead, we intend to focus on getting the most 36 Table of Contents out of the assets we already possess, including expanding our Best Buy Mobile concept to existing Canadian stores, integrating our Five Star and Best Buy operations in China, and delivering on planned synergies in Europe. Efficient and Effective Enterprise. We plan to become a more efficient and effective enterprise by re engineering our cost structure to enable us to deliver on our strategies and goals despite changing market and economic conditions, both now and in the future. We believe we can implement and sustain a more efficient cost structure that conserves our resources now and is able to progress once the economic environment recovers. We plan to use customer insights to drive our investment decisions, focusing on those with the highest and most predictable returns. We expect our efforts will limit the growth of our costs and expenses by changing how we do our work. Results of Operations Fiscal 2009 Summary Net earnings in fiscal 2009 decreased 29% to $1.0 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $3.12 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008. The decrease in net earnings was driven by a comparable store sales decline of 1.3%, deterioration in our SG&A rate and an increase in restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by improvement in our gross profit rate. Revenue in fiscal 2009 increased 13% to $45.0 billion. The increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, which contributed $3.2 billion of revenue, and the net addition of 214 new stores during fiscal 2009. These gains were partially offset by a 1.3% comparable store sales decline and the impact of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 0.5% of revenue to 24.4% of revenue. The increase was driven primarily by the inclusion of Best Buy Europe, which has a normally higher gross profit rate, as well as an improved gross profit rate in our Domestic segment driven by rate improvements in televisions and computing and increased sales of higher margin mobile phones. The increase was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin notebook computers. Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 1.5% of revenue to 20.0% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Best Buy Europe, which has a normally higher SG&A rate; deleverage of payroll, benefits and overhead on lower revenue; store projects; and continued expansion of our international businesses. Partially offsetting the increase was lower incentive compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded $144 million in restructuring and goodwill and tradename impairment charges. The restructuring charges of $78 million related primarily to termination benefits that we incurred in order to reduce our ongoing cost structure and to support our fiscal 2010 priorities. The goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66 million was related to our Speakeasy business. In accordance with our policy for evaluating investments for other than temporary impairment, we determined, based on specific facts and circumstances, that our $183 investment in the common stock of CPW had incurred an other than temporary impairment. Accordingly, we recorded a $111 million non cash impairment charge on the investment during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed the conversion of all of our U.S. Best Buy stores to include a Best Buy Mobile store within a store experience. Additionally, we added the Best Buy Mobile store within a store experience to eight Best Buy Canada stores during fiscal 2009. In June 2008, we sold $500 million principal amount of 6.75% notes due July 2013. The proceeds were used to finance a portion of our acquisition of Best Buy Europe. Effective with the cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share of common stock by 8%, to $0.14 per share. During fiscal 2009, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.54 per common share, or $222 million in the aggregate. 37 Table of Contents Consolidated Results The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Consolidated Performance Summary 2009(1)(2) 2008 2007(3) Revenue $ 45,015 $ 40,023 $ 35,934 Revenue gain % 13 % 11 % 16 % Comparable store sales % (decline) gain (1.3 )% 2.9 % 5.0 % Gross profit as % of revenue(4) 24.4 % 23.9 % 24.4 % SG&A as % of revenue(4) 20.0 % 18.5 % 18.8 % Operating income $ 1,870 $ 2,161 $ 1,999 Operating income as % of revenue 4.2 % 5.4 % 5.6 % Net earnings $ 1,003 $ 1,407 $ 1,377 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.39 $ 3.12 $ 2.79 (1)Included within our operating income for fiscal 2009 is $78 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66 million related to our Speakeasy business. Collectively, these charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.2% of revenue for the fiscal year. (2)Included within our net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $111 million ($96 million net of tax) of investment impairment charges related to our investment in the common stock of CPW. (3)Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 each included 52 weeks. (4)Because retailers do not uniformly record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers corresponding rates.

Fiscal 2009 Results Compared With Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 net earnings were $1.0 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $3.12 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008. The decrease in net earnings was driven by a comparable store sales decline of 1.3%, deterioration in our SG&A rate, and an increase in restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by improvement in our gross profit rate. Revenue in fiscal 2009 increased 13% to $45.0 billion, compared with $40.0 billion in fiscal 2008. The revenue increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of Best Buy Europe which contributed $3.2 billion of revenue in the fiscal year, the net addition of 214 new stores during fiscal 2009, and a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2008. The increase was partially offset by a 1.3% comparable store sales decline and the unfavorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2009 were as follows: Acquisition of Best Buy Europe 8 % Net new stores 7 % 1.3% comparable store sales decline (1 )% Unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1 )% Total revenue increase 13 % 38  Table of Contents The following table presents consolidated revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2009 and 2008: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 Consumer electronics 36 % 41 % (5.1 )% (1.3 )% Home office 34 % 28 % 8.2 % 7.1 % Entertainment software 17 % 19 % (4.9 )% 7.9 % Appliances 6 % 6 % (10.9 )% (2.6 )% Services 7 % 6 % 4.0 % 5.5 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (1.3 )% 2.9 % Our comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2009 reflected a decrease in customer traffic. Partially offsetting the decline in traffic was an increase in the average ticket as our revenue mix continued to shift toward large ticket items, such as notebook computers and mobile phones. Products having the largest impact on the fiscal 2009 comparable store sales decline include digital cameras, tube and projection televisions, DVDs and CDs, partially offset by gains in notebook computers, flat panel televisions and mobile phones. Revenue from our online operations increased more than 21% in fiscal 2009 and partially offset the overall comparable store sales decline. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 0.5% of revenue to 24.4% of revenue. The gross profit rate increase for fiscal 2009 was due to increases in both our Domestic and International segments gross profit rates. The acquisition of Best Buy Europe increased our gross profit rate by 0.4% of revenue for fiscal 2009. For further discussion of each segments gross profit rate changes, see the Segment Performance Summary for Domestic and International below. Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 1.5% of revenue to 20.0% of revenue. The SG&A rate increase for fiscal 2009 was due to an increase in both our Domestic and International segments SG&A rates. The acquisition of Best Buy Europe increased our SG&A rate by 0.7% of revenue for fiscal 2009. For further discussion of each segments SG&A rate changes, see the Segment Performance Summary for Domestic and International below. Our operating income in fiscal 2009 also included restructuring and goodwill and tradename impairment charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter. The $78 million restructuring charge related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation programs at our corporate headquarters and certain other locations. The restructuring charges were recorded as a result of measures we took to create a more effective and efficient operating cost structure and to support our fiscal 2010 strategic priorities. The $66 million goodwill and tradename impairment charges related to impairment of our Speakeasy business recorded as a result our annual test of goodwill for impairment. Fiscal 2008 Results Compared With Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 net earnings were slightly more than $1.4 billion, or $3.12 per diluted share, compared with nearly $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007. The modest increase in net earnings was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in our SG&A rate, offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate and a higher effective income tax rate. The increase in net earnings per diluted share was due primarily to the lower average number of shares outstanding, resulting from our share repurchases in fiscal 2008. Revenue in fiscal 2008 increased 11% to $40.0 billion, compared with $35.9 billion in fiscal 2007. The increase resulted primarily from the net addition of 137 new Best Buy, Future Shop, Five Star, Pacific Sales and Best Buy Mobile stores during fiscal 2008, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2007, a 2.9% comparable store sales gain and the non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Five Star, Pacific Sales and Speakeasy. The remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in 39 Table of Contents foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2007, the net addition of new stores during the past fiscal year accounted for more than one half of the revenue increase in fiscal 2008; the comparable store sales gain accounted for more than two tenths of the revenue increase; the non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Five Star, Pacific Sales and Speakeasy accounted for more than one tenth of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table presents consolidated revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2008 and 2007: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 Consumer electronics 41 % 42 % (1.3 )% 9.1 % Home office 28 % 27 % 7.1 % 0.0 % Entertainment software 19 % 18 % 7.9 % 3.2 % Appliances 6 % 6 % (2.6 )% (0.8 )% Services 6 % 6 % 5.5 % 9.5 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 2.9 % 5.0 % Our comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2008 benefited from a higher average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in higher ticket items, including video gaming hardware, flat panel televisions and notebook computers. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2008 comparable store sales gain included video gaming hardware and software, notebook computers, flat panel televisions and navigation products. An increase in online purchases also contributed to the fiscal 2008 comparable store sales gain. Revenue from our online operations increased more than 25% in fiscal 2008 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.5% of revenue to 23.9% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin products, including increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Our acquired China operations, which carry a significantly lower gross profit rate than our other operations, reduced our gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 by approximately 0.2% of revenue. These factors were partially offset by better promotional programs in home theater, as well as lower financing rates and Reward Zone costs. Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.3% of revenue to 18.5% of revenue. The improvement was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 11% growth in revenue and store operating model improvements. Our acquired China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our other operations, reduced our SG&A rate by approximately 0.1% of revenue in fiscal 2008. 40 Table of Contents Segment Performance Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Domestic Segment Performance Summary 2009(1) 2008 2007(2) Revenue $ 35,070 $ 33,328 $ 31,031 Revenue gain % 5 % 7 % 13 % Comparable store sales % (decline) gain (1.3 )% 1.9 % 4.1 % Gross profit as % of revenue 24.6 % 24.5 % 24.8 % SG&A as % of revenue 19.2 % 18.5 % 18.7 % Operating income $ 1,758 $ 1,999 $ 1,900 Operating income as % of revenue 5.0 % 6.0 % 6.1 % (1)Included within our Domestic segment operating income for fiscal 2009 is $72 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66 million related to our Speakeasy business. (2)Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 each included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2009 Results Compared With Fiscal 2008 In fiscal 2009, our Domestic segments operating income was $1.8 billion, or 5.0% of revenue, compared with $2.0 billion, or 6.0% of revenue, in fiscal 2008. The Domestic segments operating income rate in fiscal 2009 decreased due to an increase in the SG&A rate as well as restructuring and goodwill and tradename impairment charges, partially offset by a slight increase in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segments revenue in fiscal 2009 increased 5% to $35.1 billion. The net addition of 136 new stores contributed to the revenue increase, partially offset by the 1.3% comparable store sales decline. The components of the net revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2009 were as follows: Net new stores 6 % 1.3% comparable store sales decline (1 )% Total revenue increase 5 % The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2009 and 2008: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 Consumer electronics 39 % 41 % (5.8 )% (2.4 )% Home office 31 % 28 % 10.4 % 7.0 % Entertainment software 19 % 20 % (5.9 )% 6.1 % Appliances 5 % 5 % (15.4 )% (5.0 )% Services 6 % 6 % 4.1 % 4.1 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (1.3 )% 1.9 % Our Domestic segments comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2009 reflected a decrease in customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in the average ticket. Our Domestic segments consumer electronics revenue category posted a 5.8% comparable store sales decline, driven by declines in the sales of digital cameras, tube and projection televisions and MP3 players and accessories, which were partially offset by gains in the sales of flat panel televisions. A 10.4% comparable store sales gain in our Domestic segments home office revenue category was driven 41 Table of Contents primarily by a continuation of increases in the sales of notebook computers and mobile phones. Our Domestic segments entertainment software revenue category recorded a 5.9% comparable store sales decline due primarily to continued declines in the sales of DVDs and CDs. The comparable store sales decline was partially offset by gains in the sales of video gaming hardware and software, fueled by the increased availability of hardware and a greater selection of software. A 15.4% comparable store sales decline in our Domestic segments appliances revenue category was driven primarily by declines in the sales of major appliances and small electrics due to weakness in the housing sector. Our Domestic segments services revenue category recorded a 4.1% comparable store sales gain due primarily to growth in the sales of service contracts and extended warranties and in our product repair business. Our Domestic segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 0.1% of revenue to 24.6% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to margin rate improvements in our television and computing categories and increased sales of higher margin products within our mobile phone category, partially offset by a continued shift in our revenue mix to sales of lower margin notebook computers. Our Domestic segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 0.7% of revenue to 19.2% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales on payroll, benefits and overhead; increased spending on investments, including the roll out and staffing of the Best Buy Mobile store within a store experience; and store projects such as resets of the navigation products, computing and video gaming selling spaces and information technology enhancements to our point of sale systems. Partially offsetting the increase was lower incentive compensation as a result of lower profitability. Our Domestic segments operating income in fiscal 2009 also included restructuring, goodwill and tradename impairment charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter. The $72 million restructuring charge related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our corporate headquarters and certain other locations. The $66 million goodwill and tradename impairment was recognized within our Speakeasy business, as a result of our annual test of goodwill for impairment. The impairment charges consist of a $62 million goodwill impairment and $4 million tradename impairment. The principal factor that contributed to the impairments was changes to our expectations of Speakeasys revenue growth relative to the assumptions we made in the prior fiscal year.

The Domestic segments operating income rate in fiscal 2008 benefited from revenue gains and an improvement in the SG&A rate, partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segments revenue in fiscal 2008 increased 7% to $33.3 billion. Excluding the impact of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007, revenue increased 9% in fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of the extra week, the net addition of new stores accounted for nearly eight tenths of the revenue increase in fiscal 2008; the 1.9% comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly two tenths of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due to the non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Speakeasy. The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2008 and 2007: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 Consumer electronics 41 % 42 % (2.4 )% 8.3 % Home office 28 % 27 % 7.0 % (1.2 )% Entertainment software 20 % 19 % 6.1 % 2.4 % Appliances 5 % 6 % (5.0 )% (1.7 )% Services 6 % 5 % 4.1 % 9.0 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 1.9 % 4.1 % Our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2008 benefited from a higher average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in sales of higher ticket items, including video gaming hardware, flat panel televisions and notebook computers. Also contributing to the fiscal 2008 comparable store sales gain was an increase in online purchases, as we continued to add features and capabilities to our Web sites, including the launch of a Spanish language version of BestBuy.com and the ability of our loyalty club members to redeem Reward Zone certificates online. Revenue from our Domestic segments online operations increased approximately 30% in fiscal 2008 and added to the overall comparable store sales increase. Our Domestic segments consumer electronics revenue category posted a 2.4% comparable store sales decline, driven by declines in the sales of tube and projection televisions and MP3 players and accessories, which was offset by gains in the sales of flat panel televisions and navigation products. A 7.0% comparable store sales gain in our Domestic segments home office revenue category was driven primarily by increased sales of notebook computers. The 43 Table of Contents comparable store sales gain was partially offset by declines in the sales of desktop computers, printers and monitors. Our Domestic segments entertainment software revenue category recorded a 6.1% comparable store sales gain due primarily to sales growth in video gaming hardware and software, fueled by the increased availability of hardware and a greater selection of software. The comparable store sales gain was partially offset by continued declines in the sales of CDs and DVDs. A 5.0% comparable store sales decline in our Domestic segments appliances revenue category was driven primarily by declines in the sales of major appliances and small electrics due to soft macro economic conditions in the housing sector. Our Domestic segments services revenue category recorded a 4.1% comparable store sales gain due primarily to sales growth in home theater installation and computer services, partially offset by declines in the sales of service contracts and extended warranties. Our Domestic segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.3% of revenue to 24.5% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a lower margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from video gaming hardware and notebook computers. These declines were partially offset by better promotional spending in home theater, music and movies, as well as lower financing rates and Reward Zone costs. Our Domestic segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.2% of revenue to 18.5% of revenue. The improvement was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 7% growth in revenue and store operating model improvements, which includes labor efficiencies and an operating procedure change. International The following table presents selected financial data for our International segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): International Segment Performance Summary 2009(1) 2008 2007(2) Revenue $ 9,945 $ 6,695 $ 4,903 Revenue gain % 49 % 37 % 41 % Comparable store sales % (decline) gain (0.9 )% 9.0 % 11.7 % Gross profit as % of revenue 23.9 % 20.7 % 21.6 % SG&A as % of revenue 22.7 % 18.3 % 19.6 % Operating income $ 112 $ 162 $ 99 Operating income as % of revenue 1.1 % 2.4 % 2.0 % (1)Included within our International segments operating income in fiscal 2009 is $6 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. The charges represent termination benefits in our Canada businesses. (2)Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 each included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2009 Results Compared With Fiscal 2008 In fiscal 2009, our International segments operating income was $112 million, or 1.1% of revenue, compared with $162 million, or 2.4% of revenue, in fiscal 2008. The decrease in our International segments operating income rate resulted primarily from deterioration in the SG&A rate, partially offset by improvement in the gross profit rate. Our International segments revenue increased 49% to $9.9 billion in fiscal 2009, compared with $6.7 billion in fiscal 2008. Excluding the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, which had revenue of $3.2 billion in fiscal 2009, and the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, our International segments revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, excluding the acquisition of Best Buy Europe and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the net addition of 78 new stores (of which 51 were Best Buy Europe stores) accounted for the entire increase in revenue, partially offset by a 0.9% comparable store sales decline. The decrease in comparable store sales was the result of a 1.2% decline in comparable store sales in Canada, and a 0.1% comparable store sales decline in China. 44 Table of Contents The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2009 were as follows: Acquisition of Best Buy Europe 48 % Net new stores 6 % 0.9% comparable store sales decline (1 )% Unfavorable impact of foreign currency (4 )% Total revenue increase 49 % The following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2009 and 2008: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended March 1, 2008 February 28, 2009(1) February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 Consumer electronics 26 % 39 % (0.9 )% 5.4 % Home office 45 % 30 % (2.7 )% 7.7 % Entertainment software 9 % 13 % 3.3 % 23.7 % Appliances 10 % 13 % (2.2 )% 6.5 % Services 10 % 5 % 3.1 % 14.7 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (0.9 )% 9.0 % (1)The International segments revenue mix changed significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 due to our acquisition of Best Buy Europe. Best Buy Europe comprised 32% of the International segments revenue in fiscal 2009. The majority of Best Buy Europes business is the sale of mobile phones and acting as an agent to sell mobile voice and data service plans, which are included in our home office revenue category. In addition, Best Buy Europe offers mobile phone insurance and other mobile and fixed line telecommunication services, which are included in our services revenue category. As a result, the International segments home office and services revenue categories have increased substantially, resulting in a lower mix percentage for the segments consumer electronics, entertainment software and appliances revenue categories. The products having the largest impact on our International segments comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2009 were projection and tube televisions, computer monitors and printers partially offset by gains in video gaming hardware and software and flat panel televisions. In fiscal 2009, our International segments consumer electronics revenue category posted a 0.9% comparable store sales decline resulting primarily from declines in the sales of projection and tube TVs and MP3 players and accessories, partially offset by gains in the sales of flat panel televisions and navigation products. The home office revenue category posted a 2.7% comparable store sales decline, which resulted from comparable store sales declines in the sales of computer monitors and printers, partially offset by a gain in the sales of notebook computers. The entertainment software revenue category recorded a 3.3% comparable store sales gain reflecting an increase in the sales of video gaming hardware and software, partially offset by a decline in the sales of CDs and DVDs. The appliances revenue category recorded a 2.2% comparable store sales decline resulting primarily from decreases in the sales of major appliances and small electrics in our Five Star operations. Our services revenue category posted a 3.1% comparable store sales gain due primarily to an increase in revenue from our product repair business. Our International segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 3.2% of revenue to 23.9% of revenue. The acquisition of Best Buy Europe increased our International segments gross profit rate by 3.0% of revenue in fiscal 2009. Excluding the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, the modest gross profit rate increase was primarily driven by improved promotional control and other gross profit optimization initiatives in China, as well as the stabilization of the gross profit rate in Canada. Our International segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 4.4% of revenue to 22.7% of revenue. The acquisition of Best Buy Europe increased our International segments SG&A rate by 3.3% of revenue in fiscal 2009. Excluding the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, the increase in the International segments SG&A rate was primarily 45 Table of Contents driven by the deleveraging impact of the comparable store sales decline on payroll, benefits and overhead costs; planned investments in China, Mexico and Turkey for future store expansion and new store start up; inflationary pressures on rent and other operating costs in China; and information technology and customer analytic investments to support our international growth.

Fiscal 2008 Results Compared With Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, our International segments operating income was $162 million, or 2.4% of revenue, compared with $99 million, or 2.0% of revenue, in fiscal 2007. The increase in our International segments operating income resulted primarily from revenue gains and a significant improvement in the SG&A rate. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate. Our International segments revenue increased 37% to $6.7 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with $4.9 billion in fiscal 2007. Excluding the impact of the extra week of business in fiscal 2007, revenue increased 38% in fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of the extra week, the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for slightly more than three tenths of the revenue increase; the non comparable store sales generated from the acquisition of Five Star accounted for nearly three tenths of the revenue increase; the 9.0% comparable store sales gain accounted for more than two tenths of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due to the net addition of new Future Shop and Best Buy stores in Canada and new Five Star stores in China during the past fiscal year. Revenue from our International segments online operations increased approximately 12% in fiscal 2008 and added to the segments comparable store sales increase. 46  Table of Contents The following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2008 and 2007: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 March 1, 2008 March 3, 2007 Consumer electronics 39 % 41 % 5.4 % 15.7 % Home office 30 % 32 % 7.7 % 7.4 % Entertainment software 13 % 12 % 23.7 % 11.3 % Appliances 13 % 10 % 6.5 % 8.0 % Services 5 % 5 % 14.7 % 13.8 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 9.0 % 11.7 % Our International segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2008 reflected an increase in the average transaction amount, which was driven by continued growth in the sales of higher priced products. The products having the largest positive effect on our International segments comparable store sales gain were video gaming hardware and software, flat panel televisions, notebook computers and navigation products. Growth in the sales of these products was partially offset by comparable store sales declines in projection and tube televisions, computer software and CDs. In fiscal 2008, our International segments consumer electronics revenue category posted a 5.4% comparable store sales gain resulting primarily from gains in the sales of flat panel televisions, navigation products and digital cameras, partially offset by declines in the sales of tube and projection televisions and MP3 players and accessories. The home office revenue category posted a 7.7% comparable store sales gain, which resulted from comparable store sales gains in notebook and desktop computers, partially offset by a decline in the sales of mobile phones. The entertainment software revenue category recorded a 23.7% comparable store sales gain reflecting an increase in the sales of video gaming hardware and software, partially offset by an expected decline in the sales of computer software and CDs. The appliances revenue category recorded a 6.5% comparable store sales gain resulting primarily from increases in the sales of appliances in our Five Star operations, where appliances represent a larger percentage of the sales and whose results were included in the comparable store sales figures for the first time in fiscal 2008. Our services revenue category posted a 14.7% comparable store sales gain due primarily to an increase in revenue from our product repair business. Our International segments gross profit rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 0.9% of revenue to 20.7% of revenue. Our China operations, which operate at a significantly lower gross profit rate than our Canada operations, reduced our International segments gross profit rate by approximately 0.7% of revenue in fiscal 2008. The remainder of the decrease in our International segments gross profit rate was due primarily to the increased sales of lower margin products in both our Canada and China operations, which was partially offset by rate improvements in certain product categories as well as lower financing costs in Canada. Our International segments SG&A rate in fiscal 2008 decreased by 1.3% of revenue to 18.3% of revenue. Our China operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our Canada operations, reduced our International segments SG&A rate by approximately 0.5% of revenue in fiscal 2008. The remainder of the improvement in our International segments SG&A rate was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 37% growth in revenue and continued focus on SG&A optimization initiatives. Partially offsetting the decrease were continued costs incurred for infrastructure investments in China, the build out of an international support team and the start up costs for entry into Mexico and Turkey. Additional Consolidated Results Other Income (Expense) Our investment income and other in fiscal 2009 decreased to $35 million, compared with $129 million and $162 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due to the impact of lower average cash and investment balances, as investments were liquidated to fund our acquisition of Best Buy Europe in fiscal 2009, as well as 47 Table of Contents lower interest rates earned on our cash and investment balances in fiscal 2009. The decrease in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due to the impact of lower average cash and investment balances, as investments were liquidated to fund our ASR program in fiscal 2008. We also had a one time $20 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in fiscal 2007. Interest expense in fiscal 2009 increased to $94 million, compared with $62 million and $31 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to increased borrowings under our credit facilities, higher debt balances related to the purchase of Best Buy Europe and greater working capital needs in fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to increased borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ASR program in fiscal 2008. Investment Impairment During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we purchased in the open market 26.1 million shares of CPW common stock for $183 million, representing nearly 3% of CPWs then outstanding shares. In accordance with our policy for evaluating investments for impairment, we determined, based on specific facts and circumstances, that our investment in CPW had incurred an other than temporary impairment in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, resulting in a $111 million impairment charge. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate increased to 39.6% in fiscal 2009, compared with 36.6% in fiscal 2008 and 35.3% in fiscal 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the other than temporary impairment of our investment in the common stock of CPW and the non deductibility of our $62 million goodwill impairment charge. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a reduced tax benefit from foreign operations, lower tax exempt interest income and an increase in state income taxes. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products affected our ability to increase our gross profit rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We ended fiscal 2009 with $509 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, compared with $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2008. Our short term debt outstanding under our various credit agreements was $783 million, an increase from $156 million at March 1, 2008. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increase in short term debt was due primarily to the liquidation of a substantial portion of our cash and investment balances to fund our acquisitions of Best Buy Europe, Napster and the remaining 25% interest in Five Star and for normal working capital needs in fiscal 2009. Working capital, the (deficiency) excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $(243) million at the end of fiscal 2009, down from $573 million at the end of fiscal 2008. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,877 $ 2,025 $ 1,762 Investing activities (3,573 ) 1,464 (780 ) Financing activities 737 (3,378 ) (513 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 19 122 (12 ) (Decrease)increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (940 ) $ 233 $ 457 48 Table of Contents Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion in fiscal 2009, compared with $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to changes in accounts receivable, merchandise inventories, other assets, other liabilities and accrued income taxes. The decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable was due to the timing of the receipt of customer and network operator receivables in our Europe business (reported on a two month lag), which are typically collected subsequent to the December month end. The increase in cash used for other assets was due primarily to increases in restricted cash balances as well as a decrease in cash provided by long term receivables associated with our Europe business due to timing of collection. In addition, we had increases in cash used for other liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments of payroll and employer taxes and other accruals as well as a decrease in cash provided by gift card sales. Finally, the increase in cash used for accrued income taxes was due to the timing of tax payments. These changes were largely offset by the decrease in cash used for merchandise inventories due to our efforts to control inventory spending given changes in consumer demand experienced in the latter half of fiscal 2009. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $3.6 billion in fiscal 2009, compared with cash provided by investing activities of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008 and cash used in investing activities of $780 million in fiscal 2007. The change in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2009, compared with cash provided in fiscal 2008, was due to a decrease in the net sales of investments of $2.3 billion and increases in cash used for acquisition activities and capital expenditures. We liquidated a substantial portion of our investment portfolio in fiscal 2008 in order to repay debt incurred to fund our ASR program. We acquired Best Buy Europe, Napster and the remaining 25% interest in Five Star for an aggregate $2.3 billion in fiscal 2009 and Speakeasy for $89 million in fiscal 2008. In addition, capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 increased to $1.3 billion, compared to $797 million in fiscal 2008. Refer to Capital Expenditures below for additional information. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $737 million in fiscal 2009, compared with cash used of $3.4 billion and $513 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009, compared with cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2008, was due primarily to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock. During fiscal 2009, we did not repurchase any of our common stock, compared with repurchases of $3.5 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2008. Also, proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, were $894 million in fiscal 2009, compared with $133 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we engaged in various debt financing activities in connection with our acquisition of Best Buy Europe. Sources of Liquidity Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, including restructuring costs, and to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives in fiscal 2010. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our future expansion plans or we may not be able to pursue promising business opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we have a $2.5 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, of which $162 million was outstanding at February 28, 2009. The Credit Agreement permits borrowings up to $2.5 billion, which may be increased up to $3.0 billion at our option upon the consent of the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement and each of the banks providing an incremental credit commitment. The Credit Agreement terminates in September 2012. At April 27, 2009, we had $275 outstanding under the facility. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman") filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A subsidiary of Lehman, Lehman CPI, is one of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and represents a commitment of $180 million. Since 49 Table of Contents September 2008, Lehman CPI has declined requests for funding under the Credit Agreement and no other lender has assumed Lehman CPIs obligation to fund. As a result, our borrowing base of $2.5 billion has been effectively reduced by $180 million. We have $879 million available for borrowing under secured and unsecured revolving demand and credit facilities related to our International segment operations, of which $621 million and $36 million was outstanding at February 28, 2009, and March 1, 2008, respectively. Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At February 28, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In the event we were to default on any of our other debt, it would likely constitute a default under our credit facilities as well. An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in Exhibit No. 12.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, was 5.5 and 8.9 in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our credit ratings and outlooks at April 27, 2009, are summarized below. The rating issued by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys") is consistent with the rating and outlook reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended March 1, 2008. In November 2008, Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch") reaffirmed our BBB+ rating, but assigned a negative outlook because it believed declines in our comparable store sales were significant. In November 2008, Standard & Poors Ratings Services ("Standard & Poors") downgraded our rating to BBB and assigned a stable outlook due to the current weak economic environment in the U.S. This downgrade has not impacted our borrowing costs. Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch BBB+ Negative Moodys Baa2 Stable Standard & Poors BBB Stable Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. We are not aware of any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be downgraded. Auction Rate Securities and Restricted Cash At February 28, 2009, and March 1, 2008, we had $314 million and $417 million, respectively, of auction rate securities ("ARS") recorded at fair value within equity and other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. The majority of our ARS portfolio is AAA/Aaa rated and collateralized by student loans, which are guaranteed 95% to 100% by the U.S. government. See Note 3, Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information. Due to the auction failures that began in mid February 2008, we have been unable to liquidate many of our ARS. The investment principal associated with our ARS subject to failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, or final payments come due according to the contractual maturities of the debt issues, which range from 8 to 40 years. We intend to hold our ARS until we can recover the full principal amount through one of the means described above, and have the ability to do so based on our other sources of liquidity. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash that is pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and customer warranty and insurance programs. Restricted cash was $487 million and $309 million at February 28, 2009, and March 1, 2008, respectively, and was included in other current assets. Capital Expenditures A component of our long term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2009, 50 Table of Contents we invested $1.3 billion in property and equipment, including opening 285 new stores; adding Best Buy Mobile store within a store experiences inside new and existing Best Buy stores in the U.S. and Canada; expanding and remodeling existing stores; and upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities. Capital expenditures are funded through cash provided by operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 New stores $ 387 $ 267 $ 253 Store related projects(1) 333 222 251 Information technology 494 259 121 Other 89 49 108 Total capital expenditures $ 1,303 $ 797 $ 733 (1)Includes store remodels and expansions, as well as various merchandising projects. Debt and Capital 6.75% Notes In June 2008, we sold $500 million principal amount of notes due July 15, 2013 ("Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per year, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2009. The interest payable on the Notes is subject to adjustment if either Moodys or Standard & Poors downgrades to below investment grade the rating assigned to the Notes. Net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were $496 million, after an initial issuance discount of approximately $1 million and other transaction costs. We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and an applicable make whole amount as described in the indenture relating to the Notes. In October 2008, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act to permit either the exchange of the Notes for registered notes having terms substantially identical to the Notes (except that the registered notes would not be subject to additional interest provisions or restrictions on ownership or transfer) or, in the alternative, the registered resale of the Notes. The registration statement was declared effective on December 15, 2008. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens, enter into sale and lease back transactions and, in the case of such subsidiaries, incur debt. Convertible Debentures In January 2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402 million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 million in offering expenses, were $396 million. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at par, at our option, for cash on or after January 15, 2007. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15, 2012, and January 15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. On January 15, 2007, holders had the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. However, no debentures were so purchased. The debentures become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30 trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions 51 Table of Contents occur. During a portion of fiscal 2007, our closing stock price exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20 trading days in a 30 day trading period. Therefore, debenture holders had the option to convert their debentures into shares of our common stock. However, no debentures were so converted. Due to changes in the price of our common stock, the debentures were no longer convertible at the holders option at March 3, 2007, and have not been convertible through April 27, 2009. The debentures have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July 15, 2011, and July 15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the convertible debentures. Other At the end of fiscal 2009, $200 million was outstanding under financing lease obligations. Share Repurchases and Dividends From time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity based incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital structure. In June 2007, our Board authorized a $5.5 billion share repurchase program. The program, which became effective on June 26, 2007, terminated and replaced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2006. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases under the June 2007 share repurchase program. The June 2006 share repurchase program, which became effective June 21, 2006, terminated and replaced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in April 2005. We made no share repurchases during fiscal 2009. In accordance with our June 2007 share repurchase program, in fiscal 2008, we entered into an ASR program authorized by the Board. The ASR program consisted of two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock from Goldman for an aggregate purchase price of $3.0 billion. The ASR program concluded in February 2008. Total aggregate shares repurchased under the ASR program were 65.8 million shares at an average purchase price of $45.59 per share. At the end of fiscal 2008, $2.5 billion of the $5.5 billion authorized by our Board was available for future share repurchases under the June 2007 share repurchase program. In fiscal 2008, we also purchased and retired 9.8 million shares at a cost of $461 million under the June 2006 share repurchase program. During fiscal 2007, we purchased and retired 5.6 million shares at a cost of $267 million under the June 2006 share repurchase program, and 6.2 million shares at a cost of $332 million under the April 2005 share repurchase program. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved by our Board under the June 2007 share repurchase program, we do not expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity. We do not anticipate making any share repurchases in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 25% to $0.10 per share per quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 30% to $0.13 per share per quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 8% to $0.14 per share per quarter. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2009, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.54 per share, or $222 million in the aggregate. Other Financial Measures Our debt to capitalization ratio, which represents the ratio of total debt, including the current portion of long term debt, to total capitalization (total debt plus total 52 Table of Contents shareholders equity), increased to 30% at the end of fiscal 2009, compared with 15% at the end of fiscal 2008. The increase was due primarily to increased borrowings in connection with our purchase of Best Buy Europe and to fund normal working capital needs. We view our debt to capitalization ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), was 68% at the end of fiscal 2009, compared with 60% at the end of fiscal 2008. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is considered a non GAAP financial measure and is not in accordance with, or preferable to, the ratio determined in accordance with GAAP. However, we have included this information as we believe that our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is important for understanding our operations and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations, and to fund our future growth. In addition, we believe our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owners desire to own or to lease the location, and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is our debt to capitalization ratio. Our debt to capitalization ratio excludes capitalized operating lease obligations in both the numerator and denominator of the calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations ($ in millions): 2009 2008 Debt (including current portion) $ 1,963 $ 816 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense)(1) 8,114 5,902 Total debt (including capitalized operating lease obligations) $ 10,077 $ 6,718 Debt (including current portion) $ 1,963 $ 816 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense)(1) 8,114 5,902 Total shareholders equity 4,643 4,484 Adjusted capitalization $ 14,720 $ 11,202 Debt to capitalization ratio 30 % 15 % Adjusted debt to capitalization ratio (including capitalized operating lease obligations) 68 % 60 % (1)The multiple of eight times rental expense used to calculate the amount of our capitalized operating lease obligations is the multiple used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the "Contractual Obligations" section below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item 2, Properties, and Note 8, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 53 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Short term debt obligations $ 783 $ 783 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations 915 10 403 501 1 Capital lease obligations 65 24 22 1 18 Financing lease obligations 200 20 43 47 90 Interest payments 373 90 111 78 94 Operating lease obligations(1) 8,600 1,097 2,009 1,746 3,748 Purchase obligations(2) 2,668 1,787 757 124 Unrecognized tax benefits(3) 349 Deferred compensation(4) 55 Total $ 14,008 $ 3,811 $ 3,345 $ 2,497 $ 3,951 Note: For additional information refer to Note 6, Debt; Note 8, Leases; Note 10, Income Taxes and Note 12, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (1)Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $2.1 billion at February 28, 2009. (2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days. (3)Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, which we adopted on March 4, 2007. As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table. (4)Included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at February 28, 2009, was a $55 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table. 54  Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory Reserves We value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss reserves. Our markdown reserve represents the excess of the carrying value, typically average cost, over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis. Our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, we reserve for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis. Our markdown reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. Our inventory loss reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our markdown or inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown reserve. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdown reserve at February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2009. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss reserve. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2009. 55 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Vendor Allowances We receive funds from vendors for various programs, primarily as reimbursements for costs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and sales incentives. Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All other vendor allowances are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Based on the provisions of our vendor agreements, we develop vendor fund accrual rates by estimating the point at which we will have completed our performance under the agreement and the deferred amounts will be earned. During the year, due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical trends to ensure the deferred amounts earned are appropriately recorded. As a part of these analyses, we apply rates negotiated with our vendors to actual purchase volumes to determine the amount of funds accrued and receivable from the vendor. Certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to record vendor receivables during the past three fiscal years. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially, either positively or negatively, impact our gross profit rate and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal year and all amounts deferred against inventory turnover within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require subjective long term estimates. Adjustments to our gross profit rate and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material. A 10% difference in our vendor receivables at February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $23 million in fiscal 2009. Long Lived Assets Long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 56 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets using the methodology described herein, and determined there was impairment of $66 million. The carrying value of goodwill at February 28, 2009, was $2.2 billion. The carrying value of tradenames at February 28, 2009, was $173 million. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as our future expectations. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 57 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Revenue Recognition See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores, through our Web sites and through selected third parties. A liability is initially established for the cash value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote ("gift card breakage"). We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which show that after 24 months, we can determine the portion of the liability for which redemption is remote. We have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed at any of our Best Buy stores in the U.S., Canada and China, or through our related Web sites or when using our co branded credit cards. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at Best Buy stores and Web sites in the U.S. Canada and China. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed. Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future sales returns and the amount and timing of gift cards and certificates projected to be redeemed by gift card recipients and members of our customer loyalty programs. Our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns and gift cards or certificates projected to be redeemed is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to measure sales returns or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to measure sales returns or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales return reserve at February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1 million in fiscal 2009. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2009. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program liability at February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2009. 58 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Costs Associated With Exit Activities We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations that are under long term leases, we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a risk free interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. The liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our location closing liability at February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2009. Stock Based Compensation We have a stock based compensation plan, which includes non qualified stock options and nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Shareholders Equity, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs. We determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option pricing models. Non qualified stock option awards granted through fiscal 2005 were valued using a Black Scholes model. Non qualified stock option awards granted after fiscal 2005 were primarily valued using a lattice model. We determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Performance based nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2009. 59 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general liability claims. However, we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. When estimating our self insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries. Periodically, we review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities. Our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at February 28, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2009. Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation In accordance with accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. Minority interests proportionate ownership of assets and liabilities are recorded at historical carrying values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventory, identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames, and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three fiscal years, we completed five significant acquisitions: In October 2008, we acquired Napster for $121 million, including transaction costs. In June 2008, we acquired a 50% interest in Best Buy Europe for $2.2 billion, including transaction costs. In May 2007, we acquired Speakeasy for $103 million, including transaction costs and repayment of debt. In June 2006, we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star for $184 million, including a working capital injection of $122 million and transaction costs and in February 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest for $190 million. In May 2006, we acquired Pacific Sales for $411 million, including transaction costs. See Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for the complete purchase price allocation calculations for acquisitions completed in fiscal 2009. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 60  Table of Contents New Accounting Standards In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement). FSP Accounting Principles Board ("APB")14 1 clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon either mandatory or optional conversion (including partial cash settlement) are not addressed by paragraph 12 of APB Opinion No. 14, Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt issued with Stock Purchase Warrants. Additionally, FSP APB 14 1 specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB 14 1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not believe our adoption of FSP APB 14 1 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP for non governmental entities. We adopted SFAS No. 162 on its effective date, November 15, 2008, and it did not have a material impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand the effect these instruments and activities have on an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about: how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted SFAS No. 161 on November 30, 2008, which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(revised 2007), Business Combinations ("141R"). SFAS No. 141R significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration, preacquisition contingencies, transaction costs, in process research and development and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS No. 141R, changes in an acquired entitys deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact income tax expense. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We adopted SFAS No. 141R on March 1, 2009, which changed our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of shareholders equity. This new consolidation method significantly changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We adopted SFAS No. 160 on March 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements other than the reporting change for minority interests reported on our consolidated balance sheets, which required us to retroactively reclassify minority interests as a component of shareholders equity. At February 28, 2009 and March 1, 2008, our consolidated balance sheets included minority interests of $513 million and $40 million, respectively. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to 61 Table of Contents mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Companies are not allowed to adopt SFAS No. 159 on a retrospective basis unless they choose early adoption. We adopted SFAS No. 159 on March 2, 2008, and did not elect the fair value option for eligible items that existed at the date of adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements, and requires new disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. The Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSPs No. 157 1 and No. 157 2, which, respectively, removed leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157 and deferred for one year the effective date for SFAS No. 157 as it applies to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. On March 2, 2008, we adopted, on a prospective basis, the SFAS No. 157 definition of fair value and became subject to the new disclosure requirements (excluding FSP 157 2) with respect to our fair value measurements of (a) nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in our financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and (b) all financial assets and liabilities. Our adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The additional disclosures required by SFAS No. 157 are included in Note 4, Fair Value Measurements. The deferral provided by FSP No. 157 2 applied to such items as nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination (but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods) and nonfinancial long lived asset groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment and on March 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 as it related to these nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position or results of opertions. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active, which amended SFAS No. 157 to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset in an inactive market. FSP No. 157 3 was effective for us in our third quarter of fiscal 2009. Its additional guidance was incorporated into the measurements of fair value of applicable financial assets disclosed in Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a limited basis, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our Canada and Europe businesses enter into the contracts primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory payables. The contracts typically have terms of less than 270 days, and we do not apply hedge accounting to them. The aggregate notional amount and fair value recorded on our consolidated balance sheet related to our forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $50 million and $4 million, respectively, at February 28, 2009. The aggregate gains recorded in our consolidated statement of net earnings related to all contracts settled and outstanding was a gain of $14 million in fiscal 2009. Since July 2008, the U.S. dollar has been generally stronger relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. The overall strength of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our International segments revenue and net earnings because the foreign denominations translated into fewer U.S. dollars. It is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes; however, the effect on reported revenue and net earnings can be estimated. We estimate that the overall strength of the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately $276 million in fiscal 2009. In addition, we estimate that such strength had a favorable impact of approximately $3 million on our net earnings in fiscal 2009, due in part to our $111 million investment impairment in the common 62 Table of Contents stock of CPW, which was made by one of our Canadian subsidiaries. Interest Rate Risk Short term and long term debt At February 28, 2009, our short term and long term debt was comprised primarily of credit facilities and our convertible debentures and Notes. We do not manage the interest rate risk on our debt through the use of derivative instruments. Our credit facilities are not subject to material interest rate risk. The credit facilities interest rates may be reset due to fluctuations in a market based index, such as the federal funds rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the base rate or prime rate of our lenders. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates of our credit facilities would change our annual pre tax earnings by $8 million. Our convertible debentures are not subject to material interest rate risk. The interest rate on our debentures may be reset but not more than 100 basis points higher than the current rates. If the interest rate on the debentures at February 28, 2009, were to be reset 100 basis points higher, our annual pre tax earnings would increase by $4 million. There is no interest rate risk associated with our Notes as the interest rate is fixed at 6.75%. Long term investments in debt securities At February 28, 2009, our long term investments in debt securities were comprised of auction rate securities. These investments are not subject to material interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would change our annual pre tax earnings by $3 million. We do not currently manage interest rate risk on our investments through the use of derivative instruments. Other Market Risks Investments in auction rate securities At February 28, 2009, we held $314 million in investments in ARS, after recognizing a $15 million temporary impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Given current conditions in the ARS market as described above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we may incur additional temporary unrealized losses or other than temporary realized losses in the future if market conditions were to persist and we are unable to recover the cost of our ARS investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point loss from the par value of these investments would result in a $3 million impairment. Insurance relationships We have various commercial insurance relationships with AIG CI, a subsidiary of AIG, including our sale of extended warranties on behalf of AIG CI. AIG has advised us that its commercial insurance subsidiaries remain well capitalized with sufficient reserves and liquidity to pay claims despite the parent companys recent issues and diminished financial position. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to sell extended warranties on behalf of AIG CI, as well as to maintain our other insurance relationships with AIG CI. We have no reason to believe that the current financial condition of AIG will have a material adverse effect on AIG CI or on us. 63  Table of Contents
