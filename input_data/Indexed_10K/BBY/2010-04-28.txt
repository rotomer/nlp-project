Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in seven sections: Overview Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions, we consolidate the financial results of our Europe, China, Mexico and Turkey operations on a two month lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non financial information presented in our MD&A relative to these operations is also presented on a two month lag. No significant intervening event occurred in these operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2010. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 each included 52 weeks. Overview We are a multinational retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of all operations within the U.S. and its territories. The International segment is comprised of all operations outside the U.S. and its territories. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Europe and Canada, than in any other fiscal quarter. Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry, which indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in revenue from such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales is comprised of revenue from stores operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to call centers, Web sites and our other comparable sales channels. Revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers or dealers is not included within our comparable store sales calculation. Relocated, remodeled and expanded stores are excluded from our comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The portion of our calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change attributable to our International segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. Financial Reporting Changes To maintain consistency and comparability, we reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Our business, broadly defined, is about enriching the lives of our customers in the connected world. Specifically, our assets include approximately 180,000 employees; valuable relationships with vendors all over the world; continuing 31 Table of Contents and emerging relationships with companies like Apple, Dell, Sony and CPW; and all of the other mutually enriching business relationships that our people continue to establish and develop wherever we go around the world. We also generate significant positive cash flows. All of these assets are at our disposal as we envision how we will deepen our relationships with customers in order to increase shareholder value. Our business strategy is customer centricity. We define customer centricity through its parts, which we call our three core philosophies: inviting our employees to contribute their unique ideas and experiences in service of customers; treating customers uniquely and honoring their differences; and meeting customers unique wants and needs, end to end. We start with a view of all of our customers, including their desires and challenges. We try to match that against everything we know about the solutions that now exist, or that could be created. Then, we determine ways to deliver to customers the right solutions by using our employees knowledge and unique capabilities, as well as our network of vendors and other third party providers. If we accomplish what we have set out to do, we believe our offering is truly unique and a differentiated solution in the marketplace. We further believe that this strategy can be successful for us with a variety of products and services, store formats, customer groups and countries. In fiscal 2010, due to the challenging global economy, we heightened our focus on carefully managing our expenses and capital expenditures. Accordingly, we adjusted our new store opening plans and reduced our overall spending at stores, distribution centers and our principal corporate headquarters. Yet we never stopped improving our offerings to customers and growing our business. Our growth strategy for fiscal 2010 revolved around four business priorities that represented business opportunities where we believed we could navigate the economic conditions to put us in the strongest possible position to take advantage of economic recovery long term. Those priorities, and our successes against the priorities in fiscal 2010, included the following: Grow Market Share. We estimate we increased our Domestic segments market share during fiscal 2010 by 2.6 percentage points with notable increases in key categories such as flat panel televisions, notebook computers, digital cameras and mobile phones. We believe our significant revenue and market share growth in a year when the consumer electronics industry declined can be attributed to the impact of the loss of a significant competitor, solid store execution and new store openings. We continue to expand our product and service offerings, enhance our Reward Zone customer loyalty programs and build on our reputation as a responsible corporate citizen with programs such as @15, our teen led social change platform, as well as our recycling programs, all of which aid in our appeal to potential and current customers. Connected World. We help customers connect to a digital lifestyle, where they can seamlessly create, access and share content over a mobile phone, computer and television. By providing access to a wide selection of hardware and digital content and applications, we can offer our customers end to end solutions. The performance of Best Buy Mobile in fiscal 2010 demonstrates our success with this priority. We believe that this business priority represents an opportunity for future growth as we plan to further expand our digital offerings. International Growth. We believe the success of our customer centricity strategy in the U.S. and Canada has global application, and that we can learn and adapt much more quickly and share best practices as we continue to expand the strategy across the globe. In fiscal 2010, we believe Best Buy Europe continued to grow overall market share, and we continued to control expenses. We are preparing to open large format Best Buy stores in the U.K. in fiscal 2011 and continue to transform certain small format stores to our Wireless World format, a larger format store of up to 3,000 square feet that offers a wider array of products such as notebook computers and may include Geek Squad support services. In addition, we have delivered on the majority of our planned fiscal 2010 initiatives within our other countries of operation including store conversion plans in Canada to a wireless concept for both brands and in China, increasing our exclusive brands penetration as well as closing unprofitable stores and enhancing holiday profitability. Efficient and Effective Enterprise. We became a more efficient and effective enterprise in fiscal 2010 by re engineering our cost structure to deliver cost reductions or leverage across several revenue categories. We believe we can sustain our more efficient cost structure to conserve our resources now and 32 Table of Contents progress as the economic environment recovers. In fiscal 2010, we improved our selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") rate by 0.1% of revenue to 19.9% of revenue and our Domestic segments SG&A rate by 0.6% of revenue to 18.6% of revenue, each as compared to the prior year period. For further discussion, see the Segment Performance Summary below. Results of Operations Fiscal 2010 Summary Net earnings increased 31.3% to $1.3 billion, or $3.10 per diluted share, compared with $1.0 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. The increase in net earnings was the result of increases in both the Domestic and International segments operating income, driven primarily by revenue growth and a modest increase in the gross profit rate, as well as a modest reduction in our SG&A rate. In addition, there was a decrease in restructuring and no impairment charges compared to the prior year. Revenue increased 10.4% to $49.7 billion. The increase was driven primarily by the acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and contributed its first full year of revenue in fiscal 2010; the net addition of 85 new stores during fiscal 2010; a comparable store sales gain of 0.6% and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our gross profit rate increased by 0.1% of revenue to 24.5% of revenue. The increase was driven primarily by the acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe, which has a normally higher gross profit rate than our other businesses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in our Domestic segments gross profit rate due principally to changes in revenue mix compared to the prior year. Our SG&A rate decreased by 0.1% of revenue to 19.9% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to reductions in various discretionary categories and the leveraging impact of higher comparable store sales on payroll and benefits in our Domestic segment. Partially offsetting these decreases were the acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe, which has a normally higher SG&A rate than our other businesses, and higher incentive pay expense in our Domestic segment due to improvements in operating performance compared to the prior year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded $52 million in restructuring charges related primarily to updating our U.S. Best Buy store operating model, which included eliminating certain positions, as well as employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs in Best Buy Europe. We ended fiscal 2010 with $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, compared with $498 million at the end of fiscal 2009. Operating cash flow increased 17.5% to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 operating cash flow of $1.9 billion, while capital expenditures decreased 52.8% to $615 million. During fiscal 2010, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.56 per share, or $234 million in the aggregate. 33 Table of Contents Consolidated Results The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Consolidated Performance Summary 2010(1) 2009(2)(3) 2008 Revenue $ 49,694 $ 45,015 $ 40,023 Revenue gain % 10.4 % 12.5 % 11.4 % Comparable store sales % gain (decline) 0.6 % (1.3 )% 2.9 % Gross profit as % of revenue(4) 24.5 % 24.4 % 23.9 % SG&A as % of revenue(4) 19.9 % 20.0 % 18.5 % Operating income $ 2,235 $ 1,870 $ 2,161 Operating income as % of revenue 4.5 % 4.2 % 5.4 % Net earnings $ 1,317 $ 1,003 $ 1,407 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.10 $ 2.39 $ 3.12 (1)Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2010 is $52 million ($25 million net of taxes and noncontrolling interest) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. These charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year. (2)Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $78 million ($48 million net of tax) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66 million ($64 net of tax) related to our Speakeasy business. Collectively, these charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.2% of revenue for the fiscal year. (3)Included within our net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $111 million ($96 million net of tax) of investment impairment charges related to our investment in the common stock of CPW. (4)Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The 10.4% revenue increase resulted primarily from the acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, which contributed no revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2009 and $2.6 billion of revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2010, as well as the net addition of 85 new stores during fiscal 2010. The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Acquisition of Best Buy Europe 5.8 % Net new stores 4.3 % Comparable store sales gain 0.6 % Favorable effect of foreign currency 0.1 % Non comparable sales channels(1) (0.4 )% Total revenue increase 10.4 % (1)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation. The 0.1% of revenue gross profit rate increase for fiscal 2010 was due to a 0.4% of revenue increase from our International segments gross profit rate, partially offset by a 0.3% of revenue decrease from our Domestic segments gross profit rate. Of the 0.4% of revenue increase from our International segment, the impact of the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, which carries a normally higher gross profit rate and contributed no gross profit in the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to a full year of gross profit in fiscal 2010, increased our fiscal 2010 gross profit rate by 0.3% of revenue. For further discussion of each segments gross profit rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below. The 0.1% of revenue SG&A rate decrease for fiscal 2010 was due to a 0.4% of revenue decrease from our Domestic segments SG&A rate, partially offset by a 0.3% of revenue increase from our International segments SG&A rate. Included within the 0.3% of revenue increase from our International segment is the impact of the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, which increased our fiscal 2010 SG&A rate by 0.6% of revenue. For further 34 Table of Contents discussion of each segments SG&A rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below. Our operating income in fiscal 2010 also included $52 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter, compared to $78 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The 2010 restructuring charge related primarily to updating our U.S. Best Buy store operating model, which included eliminating certain positions, as well as employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs in Best Buy Europe, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our corporate headquarters and certain other locations. Fiscal 2009 Results Compared With Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 net earnings were $1.0 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $3.12 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008. The decrease in net earnings was driven by a comparable store sales decline of 1.3%, deterioration in our SG&A rate, and an increase in restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by improvement in our gross profit rate. The 12.5% revenue increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of Best Buy Europe which contributed $3.2 billion of revenue in the fiscal year, the net addition of 214 new stores during fiscal 2009, and a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2008. The increase was partially offset by a 1.3% comparable store sales decline and the unfavorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2009 were as follows: Acquisition of Best Buy Europe 8.1 % Net new stores 6.3 % Comparable store sales decline (1.3 )% Unfavorable effect of foreign currency (0.6 )% Total revenue increase 12.5 % The 0.5% of revenue gross profit rate increase for fiscal 2009 was due to increases in both our Domestic and International segments gross profit rates. The acquisition of Best Buy Europe increased our gross profit rate by 0.4% of revenue for fiscal 2009. For further discussion of each segments gross profit rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below. The 1.5% of revenue SG&A rate increase for fiscal 2009 was due to increases in both our Domestic and International segments SG&A rates. The acquisition of Best Buy Europe increased our SG&A rate by 0.7% of revenue for fiscal 2009. For further discussion of each segments SG&A rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below. Our operating income in fiscal 2009 also included restructuring and goodwill and tradename impairment charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter. The $78 million restructuring charge related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation programs at our corporate headquarters and certain other locations. The restructuring charges were recorded as a result of measures we took to create a more effective and efficient operating cost structure and to support our fiscal 2010 strategic priorities. The $66 million goodwill and tradename impairment charges related to our Speakeasy business and were recorded as a result our annual goodwill impairment test. 35  Table of Contents Segment Performance Summary Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Domestic Segment Performance Summary 2010(1) 2009(2) 2008 Revenue $ 37,314 $ 35,070 $ 33,328 Revenue gain % 6.4 % 5.2 % 7.4 % Comparable store sales % gain (decline) 1.7 % (1.3 )% 1.9 % Gross profit as % of revenue 24.2 % 24.6 % 24.5 % SG&A as % of revenue 18.6 % 19.2 % 18.5 % Operating income $ 2,071 $ 1,758 $ 1,999 Operating income as % of revenue 5.6 % 5.0 % 6.0 % (1)Included within our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2010 is $25 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter related to measures we took to update our U.S. Best Buy store operating model. These charges resulted in a decrease in our Domestic segments operating income of less than 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year. (2)Included within our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2009 is $72 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66 million related to our Speakeasy business. Collectively, these charges resulted in a decrease in our Domestic segments operating income of 0.4% of revenue for the fiscal year. Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The increase in our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2010 was due to higher gross profit dollars from net new store openings and comparable store sales growth, while SG&A dollars grew only 3.1% despite revenue growth of 6.4%, as shown by the decrease in the SG&A rate of 0.6% of revenue. A decrease in restructuring and no goodwill and tradename impairment charges further contributed to the additional operating income. The 6.4% revenue increase in fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from the net addition of 85 new stores during fiscal 2010 and a comparable store sales gain of 1.7%. The components of the net revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Net new stores 4.7 % Comparable store sales gain 1.7 % Total revenue increase 6.4 % The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2010 and 2009: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 27, 2010 February 28, 2009 February 27, 2010 February 28, 2009 Consumer electronics 39 % 39 % 1.1 % (5.8 )% Home office 34 % 31 % 12.8 % 10.4 % Entertainment software 16 % 19 % (13.2 )% (5.9 )% Appliances 4 % 5 % (4.2 )% (15.4 )% Services 6 % 6 % (1.1 )% 4.1 % Other 1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 1.7 % (1.3 )% Our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2010 improved sequentially each quarter of the fiscal year due primarily to an increase in average ticket and also reflects our market share gains. The products having the largest effect on our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2010 were notebook computers, flat panel televisions and mobile phones. Stronger sales in these product categories were partially 36 Table of Contents offset by comparable store sales declines in our entertainment software revenue category. Revenue from our Domestic segments online operations increased 22% in fiscal 2010 and is incorporated in the table above. The 1.1% comparable store sales gain in the consumer electronics revenue category was driven primarily by increases in the sales of flat panel televisions as unit sales increases more than offset average selling price decreases, partially offset by declines in the sales of navigation products and MP3 players. The 12.8% comparable store sales gain in the home office revenue category was primarily the result of continued growth in the sales of notebook computers, which benefited from the launch of a new operating system, as well as mobile phones, which included a full year of our Best Buy Mobile store within a store experience in all U.S. Best Buy stores, partially offset by declines in the sales of computer monitors. The 13.2% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment software revenue category was due principally to a decline in sales of video gaming, partially caused by industry wide softness and a maturing product platform, as well as a continued decline in sales of DVDs and CDs. The 4.2% comparable store sales decline in the appliances revenue category was due to a decrease in unit sales which more than offset increases in average selling prices. The 1.1% comparable store sales decline in the services revenue category was due primarily to a decline in home theater install, partially offset by modest increases in our sales of extended warranties. Our Domestic segment experienced gross profit growth of $407 million in fiscal 2010, or 4.7% compared to fiscal 2009, due to increased revenue volumes. The 0.4% of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate was due primarily to a change in revenue mix, which decreased the gross profit rate by 0.5% and resulted from a continued shift in the revenue mix to sales of lower margin notebook computers, partially offset by additional mix shift into higher margin mobile phones. In addition, improved margin rate performance provided a 0.1% of revenue increase to the gross profit rate. Despite revenue growth of 6.4%, our Domestic segments SG&A grew only 3.1% or by $207 million. Continued store openings and significant year over year performance improvements drove higher SG&A spend in fiscal 2010 for incentive pay, payroll and benefits and rent, partially offset by lower SG&A spend in various discretionary categories such as information technology and supply chain project expenditures, store reset and transformation costs, advertising and travel. The 0.6% of revenue SG&A rate decrease was primarily due to the reductions in discretionary categories discussed above, which collectively decreased the SG&A rate by 1.0% of revenue. The overall leveraging impact of higher comparable store sales on payroll and benefits further reduced the SG&A rate by 0.2% of revenue. These reductions were partially offset by higher incentive pay expense due to improvements in performance in the fiscal 2010 and no incentive pay expense in the prior year, which contributed to a 0.6% of revenue increase. Our Domestic segments operating income in fiscal 2010 included $25 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first fiscal quarter, compared to $72 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were primarily the result of updates to our Domestic segments Best Buy store operating model, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions for which we incurred employee termination costs, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our principal corporate headquarters and certain other locations. 37 Table of Contents The following table reconciles our Domestic segment stores open at the beginning and end of each of the last two fiscal years: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Best Buy 923 100 1,023 46 1,069 Best Buy Mobile (stand alone) 9 32 (3 ) 38 36 74 Pacific Sales 19 15 34 1 35 Magnolia Audio Video 13 (7 ) 6 2 8 Geek Squad 7 (1 ) 6 6 Total Domestic segment stores 971 147 (11 ) 1,107 85 1,192 Fiscal 2009 Results Compared With Fiscal 2008 The Domestic segments operating income rate in fiscal 2009 decreased due to an increase in the SG&A rate as well as restructuring and goodwill and tradename impairment charges, partially offset by a slight increase in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segments 5.2% revenue increase in fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from the net addition of 136 new stores, partially offset by a 1.3% comparable store sales decline. The components of the net revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2009 were as follows: Net new stores 6.5 % Comparable store sales decline (1.3 )% Total revenue increase 5.2 % The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2009 and 2008: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 Consumer electronics 39 % 41 % (5.8 )% (2.4 )% Home office 31 % 28 % 10.4 % 7.0 % Entertainment software 19 % 20 % (5.9 )% 6.1 % Appliances 5 % 5 % (15.4 )% (5.0 )% Services 6 % 6 % 4.1 % 4.1 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (1.3 )% 1.9 % Our Domestic segments comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2009 reflected a decrease in customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in average ticket. The 5.8% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category was driven by declines in the sales of digital cameras, tube and projection televisions and MP3 players and accessories, which were partially offset by gains in the sales of flat panel televisions. The 10.4% comparable store sales gain in the home office revenue category was driven primarily by continued increases in the sales of notebook computers and mobile phones. The 5.9% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment software revenue category was due primarily to continued declines in the sales of DVDs and CDs. The decline was partially offset by gains in the sales of video gaming hardware and software, fueled by the increased availability of hardware and a greater selection of software. The 15.4% comparable store sales decline in the appliances revenue category was driven primarily by declines in the sales of major appliances and small electrics due to weakness in the housing sector. The 4.1% comparable store sales gain in the services revenue category was due primarily to growth in the sales of extended warranties and in our product repair business. 38 Table of Contents The 0.1% of revenue gross profit rate increase was due primarily to margin rate improvements in our television and computing categories and increased sales of higher margin products within our mobile phone category, partially offset by a continued shift in our revenue mix to sales of lower margin notebook computers. The 0.7% of revenue SG&A rate increase was due primarily to the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales on payroll, benefits and overhead; increased spending on investments, including the roll out and staffing of the Best Buy Mobile store within a store experience; and store projects such as resets of the navigation products, computing and video gaming selling spaces and information technology enhancements to our point of sale systems. Partially offsetting the increase was lower incentive compensation as a result of lower profitability. Our Domestic segments operating income in fiscal 2009 also included restructuring, goodwill and tradename impairment charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter. The $72 million restructuring charge related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our corporate headquarters and certain other locations. The $66 million goodwill and tradename impairment was recognized within our Speakeasy business, as a result of our annual test of goodwill for impairment. The impairment charges consist of a $62 million goodwill impairment and $4 million tradename impairment. The principal factor that contributed to the impairments was changes to our expectations of Speakeasys revenue growth relative to the assumptions we made in the prior fiscal year.

These charges resulted in a decrease in our International segments operating income of 0.2% of revenue for the fiscal year. (2)Included within our International segments operating income in fiscal 2009 is $6 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our Canada business. The charges represent termination benefits in our Canada business. These charges resulted in a decrease in our International segments operating income of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year. 39 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The increase in our International segments operating income resulted primarily from higher operating income in Europe and China, partially offset by increased new store investments in Mexico and Turkey, $27 million of restructuring and slightly lower operating income in Canada. The 24.5% increase in revenue for fiscal 2010 was due to the inclusion of Best Buy Europe, which contributed no revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2009 and $2.6 billion of revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2010, and the impact of net new stores in the past 12 months, partially offset by the comparable store sales decline of 3.7% and decreases in our non comparable sales channels. The decrease in comparable store sales was the result of a comparable store sales decline in Canada, partially offset by comparable store sales gains in Europe and China. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on revenue for fiscal 2010. The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Acquisition of Best Buy Europe 25.8 % Net new stores 3.5 % Impact of foreign currency 0.4 % 3.7% comparable store sales decline (3.3 )% Non comparable sales channels(1) (1.9 )% Total revenue increase 24.5 % (1)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation. The following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2010 and 2009: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended(1) Year Ended(2) February 27, 2010 February 28, 2009 February 27, 2010 February 28, 2009 Consumer electronics 20 % 26 % (12.0 )% (0.9 )% Home office 53 % 45 % (0.8 )% (2.7 )% Entertainment software 7 % 9 % (12.4 )% 3.3 % Appliances 8 % 10 % 7.3 % (2.2 )% Services 12 % 10 % 6.2 % 3.1 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (3.7 )% (0.9 )% (1)The International segments revenue mix changed beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 due to our acquisition of Best Buy Europe, whose business primarily relates to the sale of mobile phones and voice and data service plans, which are included in our home office revenue category. In addition, Best Buy Europe offers mobile phone insurance and other mobile and fixed line telecommunication services, which are included in our services revenue category. As a result, the International segments home office and services revenue categories have increased in fiscal 2010, resulting in a lower mix percentage for the segments consumer electronics, entertainment software and appliances revenue categories. (2)The comparable store sales figures for the fiscal year ended February 27, 2010, include six months of Best Buy Europes comparable store sales. However, comparable store sales for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, does not include Best Buy Europe as the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was the first period in which Best Buy Europe was included in our comparable store sales calculation. The products having the largest impact on our International segments comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2010 were flat panel televisions, video gaming and digital cameras and camcorders. Weaker sales of these products were partially offset by comparable store sales gains in appliances, notebook computers and services. Our International segments comparable store sales improved sequentially each quarter of fiscal 2010 amidst improving global economic conditions and government stimulus programs in China. The 12.0% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category resulted primarily from declines in the sales of flat panel televisions, digital cameras and camcorders and navigation products. The 0.8% comparable store sales decline in the home office revenue category resulted primarily from comparable store 40 Table of Contents sales declines in computer monitors and accessories, partially offset by gains in the sales of notebook computers and mobile phones. The 12.4% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment software revenue category reflected a decrease in the sales of video gaming hardware and software and continued decreases in sales of DVDs and CDs. The 7.3% comparable store sales gain in the appliances revenue category resulted from increases in the sales of major appliances and small electrics, notably within our Canada and China operations where promotions and government stimulus programs in China helped to fuel stronger sales. The 6.2% comparable store sales gain in the services revenue category was due primarily to an increase in revenue from our product repair business. Our International segment experienced gross profit growth of $755 million in fiscal 2010, or 31.7%, driven predominantly by the acquisition of Best Buy Europe. The acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe of 1.4% of revenue was the principal driver behind the International segments 1.4% of revenue gross profit rate increase for fiscal 2010, with an additional 0.2% of revenue increase from gross profit rate improvements in Europe due primarily to negotiation of more favorable vendor terms across the European business in the second half of fiscal 2010. An increase in Canadas gross profit rate also contributed a 0.1% of revenue increase. Offsetting these increases to the International segments gross profit rate was a 0.3% of revenue decrease from China due primarily to heavier promotions and clearances. Our International segments SG&A grew 30.2%, or an increase of $682 million. In the first six months of fiscal 2010, Europes SG&A spend was $775 million with no comparable expenses in the same period one year ago. Europes lower SG&A in the last six months of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period one year ago partially offset the first half year over year increase. New store start up costs in Mexico and Turkey also increased SG&A, while SG&A spend in Canada and China remained relatively flat in fiscal 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe of 1.7% of revenue was the principal driver behind the International segments 1.1% of revenue SG&A rate increase for fiscal 2010. In addition, the deleveraging impact of the comparable store sales decline on payroll, benefits and overhead costs in Canada contributed a 0.2% of revenue increase. Start up costs, rent expense and incremental staffing for new store openings in Mexico and Turkey further contributed a 0.3% of revenue increase to the International segments SG&A rate. Offsetting these increases in the SG&A rate was a 0.8% of revenue decrease in Europe in the second half of fiscal 2010, due in part to lower payroll costs stemming from their restructuring in the fiscal first quarter, as well as a 0.3% of revenue decrease in China, caused primarily by cost cutting measures to reduce overhead, payroll and marketing expenses. Our International segments operating income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first fiscal quarter, compared to $6 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were related primarily to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs at Best Buy Europe, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges were employee termination benefits in our Canada business. 41 Table of Contents The following table reconciles our International segment stores open at the beginning and end of each of the last two fiscal years: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Acquired(1) Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Best Buy Europe 2,414 105 (54 ) 2,465 82 (94 ) 2,453 Canada Future Shop 131 9 (1 ) 139 5 144 Best Buy 51 7 58 6 64 Best Buy Mobile (stand alone) 3 3 1 4 China Five Star 160 9 (5 ) 164 6 (12 ) 158 Best Buy 1 4 5 1 6 Mexico Best Buy 1 1 4 5 Turkey Best Buy 1 1 Total International segment stores 343 2,414 138 (60 ) 2,835 106 (106 ) 2,835 (1)Acquired on June 28, 2008. Fiscal 2009 Results Compared With Fiscal 2008 The 1.3% of revenue decrease in our International segments operating income rate resulted primarily from deterioration in the SG&A rate, partially offset by improvement in the gross profit rate. The International segments revenue increased 48.6% in fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008. Excluding the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, which had revenue of $3.2 billion in fiscal 2009, and the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the revenue increase was 4.8%. In fiscal 2009, excluding the acquisition of Best Buy Europe and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the net addition of 78 new stores (of which 51 were Best Buy Europe stores) accounted for the entire increase in revenue, partially offset by a 0.9% comparable store sales decline. The decrease in comparable store sales was the result of declines in comparable store sales in Canada and China. The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2009 were as follows: Acquisition of Best Buy Europe 47.9 % Net new stores 5.7 % Comparable store sales decline (0.9 )% Unfavorable impact of foreign currency (4.1 )% Total revenue increase 48.6 % 42 Table of Contents The following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2009 and 2008: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended(1) Year Ended February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 February 28, 2009 March 1, 2008 Consumer electronics 26 % 39 % (0.9 )% 5.4 % Home office 45 % 30 % (2.7 )% 7.7 % Entertainment software 9 % 13 % 3.3 % 23.7 % Appliances 10 % 13 % (2.2 )% 6.5 % Services 10 % 5 % 3.1 % 14.7 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (0.9 )% 9.0 % (1)The International segments revenue mix changed significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to our acquisition of Best Buy Europe. Best Buy Europe comprised 32% of the International segments revenue in fiscal 2009. The majority of Best Buy Europes business is the sale of mobile phones and acting as an agent to sell mobile voice and data service plans, which are included in our home office revenue category. In addition, Best Buy Europe offers mobile phone insurance and other mobile and fixed line telecommunication services, which are included in our services revenue category. As a result, the International segments home office and services revenue categories have increased substantially, resulting in a lower mix percentage for the segments consumer electronics, entertainment software and appliances revenue categories. The products having the largest impact on our International segments comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2009 were projection and tube televisions, computer monitors and printers partially offset by gains in video gaming hardware and software and flat panel televisions. The 0.9% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category resulted primarily from declines in the sales of projection and tube TVs and MP3 players and accessories, partially offset by gains in the sales of flat panel televisions and navigation products. The 2.7% comparable store sales decline in the home office revenue category resulted from comparable store sales declines in the sales of computer monitors and printers, partially offset by a gain in the sales of notebook computers. The 3.3% comparable store sales gain in the entertainment software revenue category reflected an increase in the sales of video gaming hardware and software, partially offset by a decline in the sales of CDs and DVDs. The 2.2% comparable store sales decline in the appliances revenue category resulted primarily from decreases in the sales of major appliances and small electrics in our Five Star operations. The 3.1% comparable store sales gain in the services revenue category was due primarily to an increase in revenue from our product repair business. The acquisition of Best Buy Europe increased our International segments gross profit rate by 3.0% of revenue in fiscal 2009. Excluding the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, the modest gross profit rate increase was primarily driven by improved promotional control and other gross profit optimization initiatives in China, as well as the stabilization of the gross profit rate in Canada. The acquisition of Best Buy Europe increased our International segments SG&A rate by 3.3% of revenue in fiscal 2009. Excluding the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, the increase in the International segments SG&A rate was primarily driven by the deleveraging impact of the comparable store sales decline on payroll, benefits and overhead costs; planned investments in China, Mexico and Turkey for future store expansion and new store start up; inflationary pressures on rent and other operating costs in China; and information technology and customer analytic investments to support our international growth. 43  Table of Contents The following table reconciles International stores open at the beginning and end of fiscal 2009: Total Stores at End of Fiscal 2008 Stores Opened Stores Acquired Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal 2009 Best Buy Europe 105 2,414 (54 ) 2,465 Future Shop 131 9 (1 ) 139 Best Buy Canada 51 7 58 Best Buy Mobile Canada (stand alone) 3 3 Five Star 160 9 (5 ) 164 Best Buy China 1 4 5 Best Buy Mexico 1 1 Total International stores 343 138 2,414 (60 ) 2,835 Additional Consolidated Results Other Income (Expense) Our investment income and other in fiscal 2010 was $54 million, compared with $35 and $129 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the gains recorded in fiscal 2010 on our deferred compensation assets, which experienced better returns when compared to the prior year. Gains on these assets have no impact on our net earnings, as they are offset by expense recorded within SG&A. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of lower interest rates earned on our cash and investment balances in fiscal 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due to the impact of lower average cash and investment balances, as investments were liquidated to fund our acquisition of Best Buy Europe in fiscal 2009, as well as lower interest rates earned on our cash and investment balances in fiscal 2009. Interest expense in fiscal 2010 was $94 million, compared with $94 million and $62 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The relatively flat interest expense from fiscal 2009 to 2010 was a result of lower average short term borrowings during the year, which was fully offset by a full year of higher interest bearing long term debt. The increase in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to increased short term borrowings, higher long term debt balances related to the acquisition of Best Buy Europe and greater working capital needs in fiscal 2009. Investment Impairment During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we purchased in the open market 26.1 million shares of CPW common stock for $183 million, representing nearly 3% of CPWs then outstanding shares. In accordance with our policy for evaluating investments for impairment, we determined, based on specific facts and circumstances, that our investment in CPW had incurred an other than temporary impairment in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, resulting in a $111 million impairment charge. No investment impairments were recorded in fiscal 2010. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate ("ETR") was 36.5% in fiscal 2010, compared with 39.6% in fiscal 2009 and 36.6% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in the ETR in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due principally to the fiscal 2009 impacts of the other than temporary impairment of our investment in the common stock of CPW and the non deductibility of our $62 million goodwill impairment charge, as well as the favorable net impact of certain discrete foreign tax matters in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Excluding the impact of the fiscal 2010 discrete foreign matters, the fiscal 2010 ETR would have been 38.3%. The increase in the fiscal 2009 ETR compared to fiscal 2008 was driven by the fiscal 2009 impairment charges discussed above. Excluding the impact of the fiscal 2009 impairment charges, the fiscal 2009 ETR would have been 36.8%. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the 44 Table of Contents selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products affected our ability to increase our gross profit rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We ended fiscal 2010 with $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, compared with $509 million at the end of fiscal 2009. Our short term debt outstanding under our various credit agreements was $663 million at February 27, 2010, a decrease from $783 million at February 28, 2009. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to increased cash generated from operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Such increases in cash generated from operating activities also contributed to the decrease in short term debt as we were able to pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities. Working capital, the excess (deficiency) of current assets over current liabilities, was $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2010, up from $(243) million at the end of fiscal 2009. Operating cash flow increased 17.5% to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, while capital expenditures decreased 52.8% to $615 million. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,206 $ 1,877 $ 2,025 Investing activities (540 ) (3,427 ) 1,464 Financing activities (348 ) 591 (3,378 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 10 19 122 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,328 $ (940 ) $ 233 Operating Activities The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 was due primarily to increases in cash provided by net earnings, accounts receivable, other liabilities and accrued income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash used for merchandise inventories. The increase in cash provided by accounts receivable was due primarily to the timing of receipt of customer and network carrier receivables in our Europe business, as well as network carrier receivables associated with Best Buy Mobile in the U.S. The increases in cash provided by other liabilities were due primarily to the timing and magnitude of transaction taxes payable in various jurisdictions, as well as accrued bonuses. Finally, the increase in cash provided by accrued income taxes was due to the timing and magnitude of tax accruals as a result of higher net earnings. These changes were largely offset by the increase in cash used for merchandise inventories due to increased inventory levels in fiscal 2010, notably in notebook computers and flat panel televisions, as a result of increased consumer demand and a strengthening economy, compared to fiscal 2009 when we tightened inventory levels amidst a weaker economy and lower holiday sales. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was due primarily to changes in accounts receivable, merchandise inventories, other assets, other liabilities and accrued income taxes. The decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable was due to the timing of the receipt of customer and network carrier receivables in our Europe business, which were collected subsequent to the December month end (the last month reported in our fiscal year for our Europe business). The increase in cash used for other assets was due primarily to increases in restricted cash balances as well as a decrease in cash provided by long term receivables associated with our Europe business due to timing of collection. In addition, we had increases in cash used for other liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments of payroll and employer taxes and other accruals as well as a decrease in cash provided by gift card sales. Finally, the increase in cash used for accrued income taxes was due to the timing of tax payments. These changes were largely offset by the decrease in cash used 45 Table of Contents for merchandise inventories due to our efforts to control inventory spending given changes in consumer demand experienced in the latter half of fiscal 2009. Investing Activities The decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion of net cash associated with the acquisition of businesses in fiscal 2009, largely Best Buy Europe. Also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in capital expenditures to $615 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. See Capital Expenditures below for additional information. The change in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2009, compared with cash provided in fiscal 2008, was due to a decrease in the net sales of investments of $2.3 billion and increases in cash used for acquisition activities and capital expenditures. We liquidated a substantial portion of our investment portfolio in fiscal 2008 in order to repay debt incurred to fund our accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") program. We acquired Best Buy Europe and Napster for an aggregate $2.2 billion in fiscal 2009 and Speakeasy for $89 million in fiscal 2008. In addition, capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 increased to $1.3 billion, compared to $797 million in fiscal 2008. See Capital Expenditures below for additional information. Financing Activities The change in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010, compared with cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009, was primarily the result of a $1.1 billion decrease in borrowings, net of repayments, compared to the prior year. Larger borrowings in the prior year were associated with the acquisition of Best Buy Europe and normal working capital needs. In addition, our increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 has allowed us to decrease our short term borrowings. The change in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009, compared with cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2008, was due primarily to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock. During fiscal 2009, we did not repurchase any of our common stock, compared with repurchases of $3.5 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2008. Also, proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, were $894 million in fiscal 2009, compared with $133 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we engaged in various debt financing activities in connection with our acquisition of Best Buy Europe. Sources of Liquidity Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations and to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives in fiscal 2011. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our future expansion plans or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms. We have a $2.3 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility, as amended (the "Credit Facility"), with a syndicate of banks, with no borrowings outstanding at February 27, 2010. The Credit Facility expires in September 2012. At April 26, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. We have $962 million available under secured and unsecured revolving demand and credit facilities related to our International segment operations, of which $663 million was outstanding at February 27, 2010. Our ability to access our facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of our facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At February 27, 2010, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. If an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under our credit facilities as well. An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in Exhibit No. 12.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, was 6.08 and 5.52 in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our credit ratings and outlooks at April 26, 2010, are summarized below and are consistent with the ratings and 46 Table of Contents outlooks reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2009. Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings Ltd. BBB+ Negative Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Baa2 Stable Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB Stable Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. We are not aware of any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be downgraded. Auction Rate Securities and Restricted Cash At February 27, 2010, and February 28, 2009, we had $280 million and $314 million, respectively, invested in auction rate securities ("ARS") recorded at fair value within short term investments and equity and other investments (long term) in our consolidated balance sheet. The majority of our ARS portfolio is AAA/Aaa rated and collateralized by student loans, which are guaranteed 95% to 100% by the U.S. government. Due to the auction failures that began in mid February 2008, we have been unable to liquidate many of our ARS. The investment principal associated with our ARS subject to failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities or final payments are due according to the contractual maturities of the debt issues, which range from six to 38 years. We intend to hold our ARS until we can recover the full principal amount through one of the means described above, and have the ability to do so based on our other sources of liquidity. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and customer warranty and insurance programs. Restricted cash and cash equivalents, which are included in other current assets, were $482 million and $487 million at February 27, 2010, and February 28, 2009, respectively. Capital Expenditures A component of our long term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2010, we invested $615 million in property and equipment, including opening 191 new stores; expanding and remodeling certain stores; and upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities. The 52.8% reduction in our capital expenditures compared to the prior fiscal year was due to lower spend across all categories below. The following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 New stores $ 229 $ 387 $ 267 Store related projects(1) 90 333 222 Information technology 275 494 259 Other 21 89 49 Total capital expenditures $ 615 $ 1,303 $ 797 (1)Includes store remodels and expansions, as well as various merchandising projects. Debt and Capital 6.75% Notes In June 2008, we sold $500 million principal amount of notes due July 15, 2013 ("Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per year, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15, beginning January 15, 2009. The interest payable on the Notes is subject to adjustment if either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poors Ratings Services downgrades to below investment grade the rating assigned to the Notes. Net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were 47 Table of Contents $496 million, after an initial issuance discount of approximately $1 million and other transaction costs. We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and an applicable make whole amount as described in the indenture relating to the Notes. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens, enter into sale and lease back transactions and, in the case of such subsidiaries, incur debt. Convertible Debentures In January 2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402 million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 million in offering expenses, were $396 million. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at par, at our option, for cash on or after January 15, 2007. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15, 2012, and again on January 15, 2017, if not previously redeemed, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in cash, stock or a combination of cash and stock. The debentures become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30 trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. The debentures were not convertible at February 27, 2010, and have not been convertible through April 26, 2010. The debentures have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July 15, 2011, and July 15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the debentures. Other At the end of fiscal 2010, we had $186 million outstanding under financing lease obligations. Share Repurchases and Dividends From time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity based incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital structure. In June 2007, our Board authorized up to $5.5 billion in share repurchases. The authorization, which became effective on June 26, 2007, terminated and replaced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2006. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the June 2007 authorization. At the end of fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, $2.5 billion of the $5.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2007 was available for future share repurchases. We made no share repurchases in fiscal 2010 or 2009. In accordance with our June 2007 share repurchase authorization, in fiscal 2008, we entered into an ASR program authorized by our Board. The ASR program consisted of two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock from Goldman for an aggregate purchase price of $3.0 billion. The ASR program concluded in February 2008. Total aggregate shares repurchased under the ASR program were 65.8 million shares. In fiscal 2008, we also purchased and retired 9.8 million shares at a cost of $461 million under the June 2006 share repurchase program. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of funding and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved by our Board under the June 2007 share repurchase authorization, we do not expect that future 48 Table of Contents share repurchases will have a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity. In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 30%, from $0.10 per share to $0.13 per share. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 8% to $0.14 per share, and maintained our cash dividend at that rate for the balance of fiscal 2009 and throughout fiscal 2010. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2010, we made four cash dividend payments totaling $0.56 per share, or $234 million in the aggregate. Other Financial Measures Our debt to capitalization ratio, which represents the ratio of total debt, including the current portion of long term debt, to total capitalization (total debt plus total shareholders equity), decreased to 22% at the end of fiscal 2010, compared with 30% at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease was due primarily to a higher shareholders equity balance at the end of fiscal 2010, largely caused by accumulated retained earnings. Cash generated from operations allowed us to reduce our short term borrowings, which further contributed to the decrease in our debt to capitalization ratio. We view our debt to capitalization ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation, was 63% at the end of fiscal 2010, compared with 68% at the end of fiscal 2009. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is considered a non GAAP financial measure and is not in accordance with, or preferable to, the ratio determined in accordance with GAAP. However, we have included this information as we believe that our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is important for understanding our operations and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations, and to fund our future growth. In addition, we believe our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to that of retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owners desire to own or to lease the location, and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is our debt to capitalization ratio. Our debt to capitalization ratio excludes capitalized operating lease obligations in both the numerator and denominator of the calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations ($ in millions): 2010 2009 Debt (including current portion) $ 1,802 $ 1,963 Capitalized operating lease obligations (eight times rental expense)(1) 9,013 8,114 Total debt (including capitalized operating lease obligations) $ 10,815 $ 10,077 Debt (including current portion) $ 1,802 $ 1,963 Capitalized operating lease obligations (eight times rental expense)(1) 9,013 8,114 Total Best Buy Co., Inc. shareholders equity 6,320 4,643 Adjusted capitalization $ 17,135 $ 14,720 Debt to capitalization ratio 22 % 30 % Adjusted debt to capitalization ratio (including capitalized operating lease obligations) 63 % 68 % (1)The multiple of eight times annual rental expense in the calculation of our capitalized operating lease obligations is the multiple used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness. 49 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the "Contractual Obligations" table below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item 2, Properties, and Note 9, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Short term debt obligations $ 663 $ 663 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations 904 903 1 Capital lease obligations 49 14 12 5 18 Financing lease obligations 186 21 46 47 72 Interest payments 322 71 123 47 81 Operating lease obligations(1) 8,480 1,162 2,130 1,853 3,335 Purchase obligations(2) 2,369 1,078 645 447 199 Unrecognized tax benefits(3) 393 Deferred compensation(4) 61 Total $ 13,427 $ 3,009 $ 3,859 $ 2,399 $ 3,706 Note: For additional information refer to Note 6, Debt; Note 9, Leases; Note 11, Income Taxes and Note 13, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (1)Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $2.2 billion at February 27, 2010. (2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days. (3)Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting guidance that we adopted on March 4, 2007. As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table. (4)Included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at February 27, 2010, was a $61 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table. 50  Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory Reserves We value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss reserves. Our markdown reserve represents the excess of the cost over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis. Our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, we reserve for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis. Our markdown reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. Our inventory loss reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our markdown or inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown reserve. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdown reserve at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $9 million in fiscal 2010. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss reserve. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2010. 51 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Vendor Allowances We receive funds from vendors for various programs, primarily as reimbursements for costs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and sales incentives. Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All other vendor allowances are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Based on the provisions of our vendor agreements, we develop vendor fund accrual rates by estimating the point at which we will have completed our performance under the agreement and the deferred amounts will be earned. During the year, due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical trends to ensure the deferred amounts earned are appropriately recorded. As a part of these analyses, we apply rates negotiated with our vendors to actual purchase volumes to determine the amount of funds accrued and receivable from the vendor. Certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to record vendor receivables during the past three fiscal years. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially, either positively or negatively, impact our gross profit rate and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal year and all amounts deferred against inventory turnover within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require subjective long term estimates. Adjustments to our gross profit rate and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material. A 10% difference in our vendor receivables at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2010. Long Lived Assets Long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 52 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment. The impairment evaluation involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using a discounted cash flow model. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. Critical assumptions include comparable store sales growth, store count, gross margins, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, terminal growth rates and an appropriate discount rate. Discount rates are determined separately for each reporting unit using the capital asset pricing model, and for fiscal 2010 ranged from 10% 16%. We also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our enterprise market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as our future expectations. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years. The carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at February 27, 2010, were $2.5 billion and $112 million, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 53 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Revenue Recognition See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for amounts due from third parties that we do not expect to collect. We estimate the allowance based on historical write offs and chargebacks as well as aging trends. We sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores, through our Web sites and through selected third parties. A liability is initially established for the cash value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote ("gift card breakage"). We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which show that after 24 months, we can determine the portion of the liability for which redemption is remote. We have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed at any of our Best Buy stores, or through our related Web sites or when using our co branded credit cards. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at Best Buy stores and Web sites. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed. Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the amount and timing of future sales returns, uncollectible accounts and redemptions of gift cards and certificates. Our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns, uncollectible accounts and redemptions of gift cards and certificates is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to measure sales returns or doubtful accounts or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to measure sales returns and doubtful accounts or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales return reserve at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1 million in fiscal 2010. A 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million in fiscal 2010. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2010. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program liability at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2010. 54 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Costs Associated With Exit Activities We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations with remaining lease commitments, we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a risk free interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. The liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our location closing liability at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2010. Stock Based Compensation We have a stock based compensation plan, which includes non qualified stock options and nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Shareholders Equity, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs. We determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option pricing models. Non qualified stock option awards are primarily valued using a lattice model. We determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Performance based nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2010. 55 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general liability claims as well as customer warranty and insurance programs, although we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. We maintain wholly owned insurance captives to manage a portion of these self insured liabilities. When estimating our self insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries. Periodically, we review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities. Our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at February 27, 2010, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2010. Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. Noncontrolling interests proportionate ownership of assets and liabilities are recorded at historical carrying values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three fiscal years, we completed four significant acquisitions: In October 2008, we acquired Napster for $122 million, including transaction costs. In June 2008, we acquired a 50% interest in Best Buy Europe for $2.2 billion, including transaction costs. In May 2007, we acquired Speakeasy for $103 million, including transaction costs and repayment of debt. In June 2006, we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star for $184 million, including a working capital injection of $122 million and transaction costs and in February 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest for $196 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for the complete purchase price allocation calculations for acquisitions completed in fiscal 2010. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 56 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Codification In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a standard that established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the "ASC"), which effectively amended the hierarchy of U.S. GAAP and established only two levels of GAAP, authoritative and nonauthoritative. All previously existing accounting standard documents were superseded, and the ASC became the single source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC, which are sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other non grandfathered, non SEC accounting literature not included in the ASC became nonauthoritative. The ASC was intended to provide access to the authoritative guidance related to a particular topic in one place. New guidance issued subsequent to June 30, 2009 will be communicated by the FASB through Accounting Standards Updates. The ASC was effective for financial statements for interim or annual reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. We adopted and applied the provisions of the ASC in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, and have eliminated references to pre ASC accounting standards throughout our consolidated financial statements. Our adoption of the ASC did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on the treatment of a consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIE") in response to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of pre existing guidance, including those regarding the transparency of an involvement with a VIE. Specifically, this new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In addition, this new guidance requires additional disclosures about an involvement with a VIE and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance on February 28, 2010 and determined that it will not have an impact on our future consolidated financial position or results of operations. Transfers of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on the treatment of transfers of financial assets which eliminates the concept of a "qualifying special purpose entity," changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and an entitys continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance on February 28, 2010 and determined that it will not have an impact on our future consolidated financial position or results of operations. Subsequent Events In May 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on the treatment of subsequent events which is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. Specifically, this new guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that occurred for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. This new guidance was effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after June 15, 2009, and must be applied prospectively. We adopted and applied the provisions of the new guidance in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. In February 2010, subsequent to our adoption of the new guidance discussed above, the FASB issued updated guidance on subsequent events, amending the May 2009 guidance. This updated guidance revised various terms and definitions within the guidance and requires us, as an "SEC filer," to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued, rather than through the date the financial statements are available to be issued. Furthermore, we no longer are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. The updated guidance was effective for us immediately upon issuance. As such, we adopted and applied the provisions of the updated guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and have included the required disclosures in the Basis of Presentation section of 57 Table of Contents Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our adoption of both the new and updated guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Fair Value and Other Than Temporary Impairments In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance intended to provide additional application guidance and require enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities. New guidance related to determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly provides additional guidelines for estimating fair value in accordance with pre existing guidance on fair value measurements. New guidance on recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments provides additional guidance related to the disclosure of impairment losses on securities and the treatment of impairment losses on debt securities, but does not amend existing guidance related to other than temporary impairments of equity securities. Lastly, new guidance on interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments increases the frequency of fair value disclosures. The new guidance was effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after June 15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and have included the additional required interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments and valuation techniques in our quarterly reports. Our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Derivatives and Hedging Disclosures In March 2008, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. This guidance was intended to improve financial reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand the effect these instruments and activities have on an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Reporting entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about: how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under existing GAAP; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Our adoption of the guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we entered into significant derivative hedging contracts and, accordingly, we have included the disclosures required by the guidance in Note 7, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, on a prospective basis. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations which significantly changed the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas, including the treatment of contingent consideration, preacquisition contingencies, transaction costs, in process research and development and restructuring costs. In addition, under the guidance, changes in an acquired entitys deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement period impact income tax expense. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We adopted the guidance on March 1, 2009, which changed our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis. Noncontrolling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The guidance changed the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which must be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of shareholders equity. This consolidation method significantly changed the treatment of transactions with minority interest holders. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We adopted the guidance on March 1, 2009, and applied its provisions prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which we applied retrospectively. Our adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements other than the following reporting and disclosure changes which we applied retrospectively to all periods presented: (i)we recharacterized minority interests previously reported on our consolidated balance sheets as noncontrolling interests and classified them as a component of shareholders equity; 58 Table of Contents (ii)we adjusted certain captions previously utilized on our consolidated statements of earnings to specifically identify net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and net earnings attributable to Best Buy Co., Inc.; and (iii)in order to reconcile net earnings to the cash flows from operating activities, we changed the starting point on our consolidated statements of cash flows from net earnings to net earnings including noncontrolling interests, with net earnings or loss from the noncontrolling interests (previously, minority interests) no longer a reconciling item in arriving at net cash flows from operating activities and reclassified acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired within the investing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows to acquisition of noncontrolling interests within the financing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a limited basis, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our Canada and Europe businesses enter into the contracts primarily to hedge certain non functional currency exposures. The aggregate notional amount and fair value recorded on our consolidated balance sheet related to our foreign exchange forward and swap contracts outstanding was $1.1 billion and $4 million, respectively, at February 27, 2010. The amount recorded in our consolidated statement of net earnings related to all contracts settled and outstanding was a loss of $1 million in fiscal 2010. The overall weakness of the U.S. dollar since the end of fiscal 2009 has had a positive overall impact on our revenue and net earnings as the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. It is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes; however, the effect on reported revenue and net earnings can be estimated. We estimate that the overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on our revenue and net earnings in fiscal 2010 of approximately $41 million and approximately $12 million, respectively. Interest Rate Risk Short and long term debt At February 27, 2010, our short and long term debt was comprised primarily of credit facilities, our convertible debentures and our 6.75% notes. We do not manage the interest rate risk on our debt through the use of derivative instruments. Our credit facilities are not subject to material interest rate risk. The credit facilities interest rates may be reset due to fluctuations in a market based index, such as the federal funds rate, the LIBOR, or the base rate or prime rate of our lenders. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates of our credit facilities would change our annual pre tax earnings by $7 million. There is no interest rate risk associated with our convertible debentures or 6.75% notes, as the interest rates are fixed at 2.25% and 6.75%, respectively, per annum. Short and long term investments in debt securities At February 27, 2010, our short and long term investments in debt securities were comprised of ARS. These investments are not subject to material interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would change our annual pre tax earnings by $3 million. We do not manage interest rate risk on our investments in debt securities through the use of derivative instruments. Other Market Risks Investments in auction rate securities At February 27, 2010, we held $280 million in investments in ARS, which includes a $5 million pre tax temporary impairment. Given current conditions in the ARS market as described above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we may incur additional temporary unrealized losses or other than temporary realized losses in the future if market conditions were to persist and we were unable to recover the cost of our ARS investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point loss from the par value of these investments would result in a $3 million impairment. 59  Table of Contents
