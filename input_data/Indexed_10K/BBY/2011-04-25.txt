Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A is presented in seven sections: Overview Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions, we consolidate the financial results of our Europe, China, Mexico and Turkey operations on a two month lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non financial information presented in our MD&A relative to these operations is also presented on a two month lag. Our policy is to accelerate recording the effect of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. Except for our fiscal 2011 restructuring, for which we recorded the effects of certain restructuring charges, no significant intervening event occurred in these operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2011. Accordingly, the $171 million of restructuring charges related to our International segment were included in our fiscal 2011 results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 each included 52 weeks. Overview We are a multi national retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment products, appliances and related services. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of all operations within the U.S. and its territories. The International segment is comprised of all operations outside the U.S. and its territories. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Europe and Canada, than in any other fiscal quarter. While some of the products and services we offer are viewed by consumers as essential, others continue to be viewed as discretionary purchases. Consequently, our results of operations are susceptible to changes in consumer confidence levels and macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, consumer credit availability and the condition of the housing market. Recently, consumers have maintained a cautious approach to discretionary spending due to continued economic pressures. Consequently, customer traffic and spending patterns continue to be difficult to predict. Other factors that directly impact our performance are product life cycle shifts (including the adoption of new technology) and the competitive consumer electronics retail environment. As a result of these factors, predicting our future revenue and net 34 Table of Contents earnings is difficult. Disciplined capital allocation and working capital management and expense control remain key priorities for us as we navigate through the current environment. By providing access to a wide selection of consumer electronics products and accessories; a vast array of service offerings, such as extended warranties, installation and repair; and a knowledgeable sales staff to help our customers select and connect their devices, we believe we offer our customers a differentiated value proposition. Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry, which indicates store performance by measuring the growth in revenue for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales is comprised of revenue from stores operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to call centers, Web sites and our other comparable sales channels. Revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers or dealers is not included within our comparable store sales calculation. Relocated, remodeled and expanded stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The portion of our calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change attributable to our International segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. In our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segments operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates. We use this method for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Broadly defined, our Connected World strategy is based on the goal to demystify and humanize technology to help customers get the most out of the rapidly expanding role that technology plays in their lives. The assets we leverage to bring this strategy to life include our approximately 180,000 employees around the world and the dedication and expertise they bring; valuable relationships with our vendors; our brand names and reputation; and our unique multi channel model which provides customer touch point opportunities through retail store locations, Web sites, mobile applications and call centers. The Connected World gives us access to a much larger addressable market than just the traditional consumer electronics hardware market. While a large part of the traditional focus of our business has been on consumer electronics products, we have significant incremental opportunities in selling accessories, content, connections and services. Our three primary strategic priorities are: Capture New Growth Opportunities and Target Online Opportunities. The unrelenting pace of change in technology provides both opportunities and challenges for our customers, and we believe we are well positioned to help them navigate through these and to enrich their lives through the use of technology. Our current growth priorities include continuing the recent expansion in Best Buy Mobile, mobile computing (particularly with the growing selection of tablet computers) and increasing our market share in appliances and gaming. In addition, we believe our customers will increasingly appreciate our Geek Squad service offerings and innovative purchase options, such as the recently launched "Buy Back" program in the U.S. Finally, we foresee opportunities for increasing the number of connections we sell, a vital proposition to our customers wishing to access people and content such as streaming 35 Table of Contents movies and music, internet and television. This opportunity is most prevalent today in mobile phones, but also in connecting computing devices to mobile broadband and televisions to broadband services. We believe that our established multi channel strategy provides us competitive advantages in that it allows customers to connect with us in a variety of ways. For example, customers can interact with us directly through our store, online, mobile application or call center channels or through a combination of channels, such as purchasing online for in store pick up. We plan to continue to leverage these capabilities to offer consumers options that are flexible and convenient. Our online growth plans also include allowing external vendors and retailers to sell through our Web sites, extending our reach by allowing partners to market our products and services and leveraging online traffic to sell advertising. Improve Growth and Returns in International Markets. Our international strategy is focused on four key geographic areas (Canada, China, Europe and Mexico), where we believe we can leverage size, scale and economics to succeed. In China, we expect to continue investment in profitable growth as we look to grow our position in this fast growing market through our Five Star business. In our established businesses in Canada and Europe (small format stores), we plan to continue our evolution into Connected World solutions. In our relatively new markets such as the U.K. (large format stores) and Mexico, our growth will likely be more measured, as we increase our understanding and appreciation for customers needs in these markets. Drive Structural Opportunities to Improve Returns. In order to provide value to our customers and to fund growth opportunities that we are targeting, we must operate efficiently and effectively. We have a disciplined approach to managing our costs and capital allocation. We require each of our businesses to meet sufficient ROIC levels over appropriate time horizons. Our growth strategies require that we continue to increase our points of presence in order to fully realize the benefits of our multi channel strategy. Our plans to continue the expansion of our U.S. Best Buy Mobile stand alone stores is expected to increase our presence and allow us to reduce our large format store footprint. We also seek to improve store productivity through actions such as expansion of our "Connected Store" model roll out, increasing our presence in pre owned and pre order games and expanding our Pacific Sales store within a store appliances model. Results of Operations Fiscal 2011 Summary Net earnings decreased 3.0% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease in net earnings was the result of decreases in both the Domestic and International segments operating income, driven primarily by the $222 million ($147 million net of tax) of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to $52 million ($25 million net of taxes and noncontrolling interest) of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. Earnings per diluted share of $3.08 in fiscal 2011 was essentially flat compared to $3.10 in fiscal 2010. Revenue increased 1.2% to $50.3 billion. The increase was driven primarily by the net addition of 147 new stores during fiscal 2011 and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.8%. Our gross profit rate increased by 0.6% of revenue to 25.1% of revenue. The increase was driven by an increase in our Domestic segments gross profit rate primarily due to strong sales of higher margin smartphones as a result of the continued growth of Best Buy Mobile. Our SG&A rate increased by 0.6% of revenue to 20.5% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales in our Domestic segment, as well as a change in the form of vendor funding. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in incentive compensation in our Domestic segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded $222 million in restructuring charges related to our plans to exit the Turkey market, restructure the Best Buy branded stores in China and improve efficiencies in our Domestic operations, 36 Table of Contents which resulted in charges for inventory write downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits, intangible asset impairments and facility closure costs. We ended fiscal 2011 with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2010. Operating cash flow decreased to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 operating cash flow of $2.2 billion due primarily to changes in working capital, while capital expenditures increased 21.0% to $744 million. During fiscal 2011, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.58 per share, or $237 million in the aggregate. We repurchased and retired 32.6 million shares at a cost of $1.2 billion during fiscal 2011. Consolidated Results The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Consolidated Performance Summary 2011(1) 2010(2) 2009(3)(4) Revenue $ 50,272 $ 49,694 $ 45,015 Revenue gain % 1.2 % 10.4 % 12.5 % Comparable store sales % (decline) gain (1.8 )% 0.6 % (1.3 )% Gross profit as % of revenue(5) 25.1 % 24.5 % 24.4 % SG&A as % of revenue(5) 20.5 % 19.9 % 20.0 % Operating income $ 2,114 $ 2,235 $ 1,870 Operating income as % of revenue 4.2 % 4.5 % 4.2 % Net earnings $ 1,277 $ 1,317 $ 1,003 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.08 $ 3.10 $ 2.39 (1)Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2011 is $222 million ($147 million net of taxes) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. These charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.5% of revenue for the fiscal year. (2)Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2010 is $52 million ($25 million net of taxes and noncontrolling interest) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. These charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year. (3)Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $78 million ($48 million net of tax) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66 million ($64 net of tax) related to our former Speakeasy business. Collectively, these charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.2% of revenue for the fiscal year. (4)Included within our net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $111 million ($96 million net of tax) of investment impairment charges related to our investment in the common stock of CPW. (5)Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010 Throughout fiscal 2011, the majority of geographic markets in which we operate generally continued to endure difficult and uncertain economic conditions. In addition, customer appetite for certain product categories was below industry expectations. Both of these factors had a direct bearing on our revenue. We have responded to the current economic environment by closely managing our SG&A, as well as focusing on efforts to improve our gross profit. The 1.2% revenue increase in fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from the net addition of 147 new stores during fiscal 2011 and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline. 37 Table of Contents The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2011 were as follows: Net new stores 2.6 % Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 0.6 % Comparable store sales impact (1.7 )% Non comparable sales channels(1) (0.2 )% One less week of revenue for Best Buy Europe(2) (0.1 )% Total revenue increase 1.2 % (1)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation. (2)Reflects the incremental revenue associated with Best Buy Europe in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which had 14 weeks of activity, compared to 13 weeks in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our gross profit rate increased 0.6% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Gross profit rate improvements in our Domestic segment accounted for an increase of 0.7% of revenue. The relatively flat gross profit rate in our International segment had no impact on the consolidated gross profit rate. In addition, restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 accounted for a decrease in the gross profit rate of 0.1% of revenue. For further discussion of each segments gross profit rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below. The 0.6% of revenue SG&A rate increase for fiscal 2011 was due to a 0.7% of revenue increase attributable to the increase in our Domestic segments SG&A rate, partially offset by a 0.1% of revenue decrease attributable to the decrease in our International segments SG&A rate. For further discussion of each segments SG&A rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below. Our operating income decreased $121 million, or 5.4%, and our operating income rate decreased to 4.2% of revenue in fiscal 2011, compared to 4.5% of revenue in fiscal 2010. The 0.3% of revenue operating income rate decrease was driven by an increase in our SG&A rate and increased restructuring charges, partially offset by an increase in our gross profit rate. Our operating income in fiscal 2011 included $222 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $52 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 restructuring charges include plans to exit the Turkey market, restructure the Best Buy branded stores in China and improve efficiencies in our Domestic segment, which resulted in charges for inventory write downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits, intangible asset impairments and facility closure costs. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges related primarily to updating our U.S. Best Buy store operating model, which included eliminating certain positions, as well as employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs in Best Buy Europe. Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The 10.4% revenue increase resulted primarily from the acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, which contributed no revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2009 and $2.6 billion of revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2010, as well as the net addition of 85 new stores during fiscal 2010. The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Acquisition of Best Buy Europe 5.8 % Net new stores 4.3 % Comparable store sales impact 0.6 % Favorable effect of foreign currency 0.1 % Non comparable sales channels(1) (0.4 )% Total revenue increase 10.4 % (1)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation. 38 Table of Contents The 0.1% of revenue gross profit rate increase for fiscal 2010 was due to a 0.4% of revenue increase from our International segments gross profit rate, partially offset by a 0.3% of revenue decrease from our Domestic segments gross profit rate. Of the 0.4% of revenue increase from our International segment, the impact of the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, which carries a normally higher gross profit rate and contributed no gross profit in the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to a full year of gross profit in fiscal 2010, increased our fiscal 2010 gross profit rate by 0.3% of revenue. For further discussion of each segments gross profit rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below. The 0.1% of revenue SG&A rate decrease for fiscal 2010 was due to a 0.4% of revenue decrease from our Domestic segments SG&A rate, partially offset by a 0.3% of revenue increase from our International segments SG&A rate. Included within the 0.3% of revenue increase from our International segment is the impact of the acquisition of Best Buy Europe, which increased our fiscal 2010 SG&A rate by 0.6% of revenue. For further discussion of each segments SG&A rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below. Our operating income in fiscal 2010 also included $52 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter, compared to $78 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The 2010 restructuring charge related primarily to updating our U.S. Best Buy store operating model, which included eliminating certain positions, as well as employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs in Best Buy Europe, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our corporate headquarters and certain other locations. 39  Table of Contents Segment Performance Summary Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Domestic Segment Performance Summary 2011(1) 2010(2) 2009(3) Revenue $ 37,186 $ 37,314 $ 35,070 Revenue (decline) gain % (0.3 )% 6.4 % 5.2 % Comparable store sales % (decline) gain (3.0 )% 1.7 % (1.3 )% Gross profit as % of revenue 25.1 % 24.2 % 24.6 % SG&A as % of revenue 19.6 % 18.6 % 19.2 % Operating income $ 2,031 $ 2,071 $ 1,758 Operating income as % of revenue 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.0 % (1)Included within our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2011 is $51 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to increase our efficiency. These charges resulted in a decrease in our Domestic segments operating income of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year. (2)Included within our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2010 is $25 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter related to measures we took to update our U.S. Best Buy store operating model. These charges resulted in a decrease in our Domestic segments operating income of less than 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year. (3)Included within our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2009 is $72 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66 million related to our former Speakeasy business. Collectively, these charges resulted in a decrease in our Domestic segments operating income of 0.4% of revenue for the fiscal year. The following table reconciles our Domestic segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Best Buy 1,023 46 1,069 31 (1 ) 1,099 Best Buy Mobile 38 36 74 103 177 Pacific Sales 34 1 35 35 Magnolia Audio Video 6 6 6 Geek Squad 6 6 (6 ) Total Domestic segment stores 1,107 83 1,190 134 (7 ) 1,317 Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010 Our Domestic segments gross profit improved in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, with a continued rate improvement partially offset by a revenue decline. These factors, combined with an increase in SG&A and restructuring charges, led to a modest decline in operating income. We believe the revenue decline resulted primarily from a combination of weakness in several key consumer electronics industry product categories and a decline in our estimated domestic market share. Consumers continue to be highly selective and cautious about how and when they make consumer electronics purchases. As a specialty retailer in the consumer electronics industry, the adoption of new technology and the timing of product life cycles continue to play an important role in revenue trends. For example, the demand for new television technologies did not materialize as the industry anticipated. Similarly, we saw a shift in consumer demand within mobile computing, as increased sales of tablets resulted in a lower overall sales mix of notebook computers throughout fiscal 2011. 40 Table of Contents The 0.3% revenue decline in fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a comparable store sales decline of 3.0%, partially offset by the impact of net new stores opened during fiscal 2011. The components of the net revenue decrease in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2011 were as follows: Comparable store sales impact (2.9 )% Non comparable sales channels(1) (0.1 )% Net new stores 2.7 % Total revenue decrease (0.3 )% (1)Non comparable sales channels reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation. The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2011 and 2010: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 26, 2011 February 27, 2010 February 26, 2011 February 27, 2010 Consumer electronics 37 % 39 % (6.3 )% 1.1 % Home office 37 % 34 % 3.6 % 12.8 % Entertainment 14 % 16 % (13.3 )% (13.2 )% Appliances 5 % 4 % 7.0 % (4.2 )% Services 6 % 6 % 0.5 % (1.1 )% Other 1 % 1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (3.0 )% 1.7 % The products having the largest impact on our comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2011 were entertainment hardware and software (which includes video gaming hardware and software, CDs and DVDs) and televisions. Comparable store sales gains in mobile phones, mobile computing (consisting of notebook computers, netbooks and tablets) partially offset these declines. Revenue from our Domestic segments online operations increased 13% in fiscal 2011 and is incorporated in the table above. The 6.3% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category was driven primarily by a decrease in the sales of televisions and cameras and camcorders, partially offset by strong sales from our expanded assortment of e Readers. The 3.6% comparable store sales gain in the home office revenue category was primarily the result of increased sales of mobile phones due to the continued growth of Best Buy Mobile, as well as gains in the sales of mobile computing. The 13.3% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment revenue category was mainly the result of declining sales in video gaming hardware and software, partially caused by industry wide softness combined with a decline in our market share, as well as the continued decline in the sales of DVDs and CDs as consumers shift to digital content. The 7.0% comparable store sales gain in the appliances revenue category was due to an increase in unit sales with relatively flat average selling prices, with particular strength in kitchen and small appliances. The 0.5% comparable store sales gain in the services revenue category was due primarily to a gain in the sales of computer services, partially offset by a decline in the sales of repair and home theater installation services, due in part to the decrease in television sales noted above. Despite a modest decline in revenue, our Domestic segment experienced gross profit growth in fiscal 2011 of $324 million, or 3.6%, compared to fiscal 2010, due to rate improvements. The 0.9% of revenue increase in the gross profit rate was due to favorable rate and mix impacts of 0.7% of revenue and 0.2% of revenue, respectively, and resulted primarily from the following factors collectively: increased sales of higher margin mobile phones as a result of the growth in Best Buy Mobile; 41 Table of Contents a change in the form of vendor funding for fiscal 2011, shifting more dollars to gross profit than SG&A; and improved attachment of services, particularly in the mobile computing product category; partially offset by declining average selling prices of televisions. Our Domestic segments SG&A grew $348 million, or 5.0%, in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in SG&A was driven by the opening of new stores and an increase in the Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The following factors collectively contributed to the Domestic segments SG&A rate increase of 1.0% of revenue: deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline; continued growth in Best Buy Mobile (including the profit share based management fee we paid to Best Buy Europe, which is offset in the International segment SG&A results and, therefore, has no net impact on our consolidated operating income); and the change in the form of vendor funding as discussed above; partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The $40 million decrease in our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in restructuring charges, a modest decline in revenue, and higher SG&A spending, partially offset by increased gross profit due to an improvement in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segments operating income in fiscal 2011 included $51 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $25 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 restructuring charges resulted from activities to improve efficiencies in our Domestic segment, which resulted in charges for inventory write downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits and intangible asset impairments. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges related primarily to updating our U.S. Best Buy store operating model, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions for which we incurred employee termination costs. Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The 6.4% revenue increase in fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from the net addition of 85 new stores during fiscal 2010 and a comparable store sales gain of 1.7%. The components of the net revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Net new stores 4.7 % Comparable store sales impact 1.7 % Total revenue increase 6.4 % 42 Table of Contents The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2010 and 2009: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 27, 2010 February 28, 2009 February 27, 2010 February 28, 2009 Consumer electronics 39 % 39 % 1.1 % (5.8 )% Home office 34 % 31 % 12.8 % 10.4 % Entertainment 16 % 19 % (13.2 )% (5.9 )% Appliances 4 % 5 % (4.2 )% (15.4 )% Services 6 % 6 % (1.1 )% 4.1 % Other 1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 1.7 % (1.3 )% Our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2010 improved sequentially each quarter of the fiscal year due primarily to an increase in average ticket and reflected our market share gains. The products having the largest effect on our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2010 were notebook computers, flat panel televisions and mobile phones. Stronger sales in these product categories were partially offset by comparable store sales declines in our entertainment revenue category. Revenue from our Domestic segments online operations increased 22% in fiscal 2010 and is incorporated in the table above. The 1.1% comparable store sales gain in the consumer electronics revenue category was driven primarily by increases in the sales of flat panel televisions as unit sales increases more than offset average selling price decreases, partially offset by declines in the sales of navigation products and MP3 players. The 12.8% comparable store sales gain in the home office revenue category was primarily the result of continued growth in the sales of notebook computers, which benefited from the launch of a new operating system, as well as mobile phones, which included a full year of our Best Buy Mobile store within a store experience in all U.S. Best Buy stores, partially offset by declines in the sales of computer monitors. The 13.2% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment revenue category was due principally to a decline in sales of video gaming, partially caused by industry wide softness and a maturing product platform, as well as a continued decline in sales of DVDs and CDs. The 4.2% comparable store sales decline in the appliances revenue category was due to a decrease in unit sales which more than offset increases in average selling prices. The 1.1% comparable store sales decline in the services revenue category was due primarily to a decline in home theater installation, partially offset by modest increases in our sales of extended warranties. Our Domestic segment experienced gross profit growth of $407 million in fiscal 2010, or 4.7% compared to fiscal 2009, due to increased revenue volumes. The 0.4% of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate was due primarily to a change in revenue mix, which reduced the gross profit rate by 0.5% of revenue and resulted from a continued shift in the revenue mix to sales of lower margin notebook computers, partially offset by additional mix shift into higher margin mobile phones. In addition, improved margin rate performance provided a 0.1% of revenue increase to the gross profit rate. Despite revenue growth of 6.4%, our Domestic segments SG&A grew only 3.1% or by $207 million. Continued store openings and significant year over year performance improvements drove higher SG&A spend in fiscal 2010 for incentive pay, payroll and benefits and rent, partially offset by lower SG&A spend in various discretionary categories such as information technology and supply chain project expenditures, store reset and transformation costs, advertising and travel. The 0.6% of revenue SG&A rate decline was primarily due to the reductions in discretionary categories discussed above, which collectively reduced the SG&A rate by 1.0% of revenue. The overall leveraging impact of higher comparable store sales on payroll and benefits further reduced the SG&A rate by 0.2% of revenue. However, we had higher incentive pay expense due to improvements in performance in fiscal 2010 and no incentive pay expense in the prior year, which collectively offset the SG&A rate improvement by 0.6% of revenue. 43 Table of Contents The increase in our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2010 was due to higher gross profit dollars from net new store openings and comparable store sales growth, while SG&A dollars grew only 3.1% despite revenue growth of 6.4%, as shown by the decrease in the SG&A rate of 0.6% of revenue. A decrease in restructuring and no goodwill and tradename impairment charges further contributed to the additional operating income. Our Domestic segments operating income in fiscal 2010 included $25 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first fiscal quarter, compared to $72 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were primarily the result of updates to our Domestic segments Best Buy branded store operating model, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions for which we incurred employee termination costs, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our principal corporate headquarters and certain other locations.

These charges resulted in a decrease in our International segments operating income of 1.3% of revenue for the fiscal year. (2)Included within our International segments operating income in fiscal 2010 is $27 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter, primarily related to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs in Best Buy Europe. These charges resulted in a decrease in our International segments operating income of 0.2% of revenue for the fiscal year. (3)Included within our International segments operating income in fiscal 2009 is $6 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our Canada business. The charges represent termination benefits in our Canada business. These charges resulted in a decrease in our International segments operating income of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year. 44 Table of Contents The following table reconciles our International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Best Buy Europe small box(1) 2,465 82 (94 ) 2,453 86 (99 ) 2,440 Best Buy Europe big box(2) 6 6 Canada Future Shop 139 5 144 2 146 Best Buy 58 6 64 7 71 Best Buy Mobile 3 1 4 6 10 China Five Star 164 6 (12 ) 158 12 (4 ) 166 Best Buy(3) 5 1 6 2 8 Mexico Best Buy 1 4 5 1 6 Turkey Best Buy(3) 1 1 1 2 Total International segment stores 2,835 106 (106 ) 2,835 123 (103 ) 2,855 (1)Represents The Carphone Warehouse and The Phone House small format stores.

Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010 While challenging economic conditions persisted in fiscal 2011 in many of the countries in which we operate, our International segment continued to grow revenue and experienced a comparable store sales gain for the year. A decline in operating income was due principally to the impact of the restructuring activities in fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the International segment experienced gross profit improvements with only a modest increase in SG&A. Continued growth in consumer spending and temporary government stimulus programs contributed to stronger sales and improved operating income in our China operations, particularly in our Five Star business. Our Canada operations faced many of the same market conditions and factors affecting the U.S. consumer electronics industry, with the adoption of new technology and the timing of product life cycles continuing to play an important role in revenue trends. Similarly, our Europe operations saw the impacts from a constrained economy, but continued to benefit from higher Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fees paid in fiscal 2011. The 5.7% increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was due to the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (mainly related to the Canadian dollar), the impact of net new stores opened during fiscal 2011, and a 2.4% comparable store sales gain, partially offset by the impact of having one less week of revenue in Europe and a decline in sales in non comparable sales channels. The increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2011 was the result of gains in China and Europe, partially offset by a decline in Canada. 45 Table of Contents The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2011 were as follows: Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 2.4 % Net new stores 2.3 % Comparable store sales impact 2.0 % One less week of revenue for Best Buy Europe(1) (0.6 )% Non comparable sales channels(2) (0.4 )% Total revenue increase 5.7 % (1)Reflects the incremental revenue associated with Best Buy Europe in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which had 14 weeks of activity, compared to 13 weeks in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. (2)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation. The following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2011 and 2010: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 26, 2011 February 27, 2010 February 26, 2011 February 27, 2010 Consumer electronics 21 % 20 % (2.5 )% (12.0 )% Home office 55 % 53 % 5.0 % (0.8 )% Entertainment 6 % 7 % (12.4 )% (12.4 )% Appliances 9 % 8 % 15.2 % 7.3 % Services 9 % 12 % (1.6 )% 6.2 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 2.4 % (3.7 )% The products having the largest impact on our International segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2011 were mobile phones, appliances and mobile computing. Increased sales in these product categories were partially offset by declines in the sales of entertainment hardware and software, including video gaming hardware and software, DVDs and CDs. The 2.5% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category resulted primarily from declines in the sales of navigation products and MP3 players and accessories. Televisions remained essentially flat, as gains in the sales of televisions in China, were offset by declines in Canada, which faced market conditions similar to the U.S. The 5.0% comparable store sales gain in the home office revenue category resulted primarily from gains in the sales of mobile phones and mobile computing, partially offset by declines in sales of desktop computers, monitors and accessories. The 12.4% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment revenue category reflected a decrease in the sales of video gaming hardware and software and continued decreases in sales of DVDs and CDs. The 15.2% comparable store sales gain in the appliances revenue category resulted primarily from increases in the sales of appliances within our Five Star operations, where growth in consumer spending and temporary government stimulus programs continued to contribute to stronger sales. The 1.6% comparable store sales decline in the services revenue category was due primarily to a decrease in the sales of extended warranties driven by declines in the sales of televisions and notebook computers in Canada. Our International segment experienced gross profit growth in fiscal 2011 of $153 million, or 4.9%. The increase in gross profit in fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in revenue and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as the gross profit rate decreased slightly. The 0.2% of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate in fiscal 2011 reflects an unfavorable mix impact of 0.5% of revenue, partially offset by a favorable rate impact of 0.3% of revenue. The unfavorable mix impact resulted primarily from growth in our lower margin China business and a decrease in the mix of our higher margin Europe business. The favorable rate impact was mainly the result of gains in Canada, with improved 46 Table of Contents margins in all product categories, especially mobile computing and entertainment hardware and software. In addition, restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 had an unfavorable impact of 0.1% of revenue. In fiscal 2011, our International segments SG&A increased $104 million, or 3.5%, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased spending associated with new store openings across the segment, partially offset by a decrease in Europe due to the higher Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, our International segments SG&A increased $35 million. The 0.5% of revenue improvement in the SG&A rate was driven primarily by a rate decline in Europe due to the higher Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee and the favorable mix impact from both growth in our lower rate China business and a decrease in the sales mix of our higher rate Europe business. These improvements were partially offset by a rate increase in Canada caused by the deleveraging impact of its comparable store sales decline and increased advertising costs to drive traffic. The decrease in our International segments operating income in fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from higher restructuring charges and costs associated with the operation of new large format stores in Europe, China, Mexico and Turkey, partially offset by higher operating income in Europe and from Five Star. Our International segments operating income in fiscal 2011 included $171 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter, compared to $27 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 restructuring charges primarily related to inventory write downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits and facility closure costs as a result of our plans to exit the Turkey market and restructure the Best Buy branded stores in China. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were related primarily to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs at Best Buy Europe. Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The 24.5% increase in revenue for fiscal 2010 was due to the inclusion of Best Buy Europe, which contributed no revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2009 and $2.6 billion of revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2010, and the impact of net new stores opened during fiscal 2010, partially offset by the comparable store sales decline of 3.7% and decreases in our non comparable sales channels. The decrease in comparable store sales was the result of a comparable store sales decline in Canada, partially offset by comparable store sales gains in Europe and China. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on revenue for fiscal 2010. The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Acquisition of Best Buy Europe 25.8 % Net new stores 3.5 % Impact of foreign currency 0.4 % Comparable store sales impact (3.3 )% Non comparable sales channels(1) (1.9 )% Total revenue increase 24.5 % (1)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation. 47 Table of Contents The following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2010 and 2009: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended(1) Year Ended(2) February 27, 2010 February 28, 2009 February 27, 2010 February 28, 2009 Consumer electronics 20 % 26 % (12.0 )% (0.9 )% Home office 53 % 45 % (0.8 )% (2.7 )% Entertainment 7 % 9 % (12.4 )% 3.3 % Appliances 8 % 10 % 7.3 % (2.2 )% Services 12 % 10 % 6.2 % 3.1 % Other &lt;1 % &lt;1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (3.7 )% (0.9 )% (1)The International segments revenue mix changed beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 due to our acquisition of Best Buy Europe, whose business primarily relates to the sale of mobile phones and voice and data service plans, which are included in our home office revenue category. In addition, Best Buy Europe offers mobile phone insurance and other mobile and fixed line telecommunication services, which are included in our services revenue category. As a result, the International segments home office and services revenue categories grew in fiscal 2010, resulting in a lower mix percentage for the segments consumer electronics, entertainment and appliances revenue categories. (2)The comparable store sales figures for the fiscal year ended February 27, 2010, included six months of Best Buy Europes comparable store sales. However, comparable store sales for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, did not include Best Buy Europe as the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was the first period in which Best Buy Europe was included in our comparable store sales calculation. The products having the largest impact on our International segments comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2010 were flat panel televisions, video gaming and digital cameras and camcorders. Weaker sales of these products were partially offset by comparable store sales gains in appliances, notebook computers and services. Our International segments comparable store sales improved sequentially each quarter of fiscal 2010 amidst improving global economic conditions and temporary government stimulus programs in China. The 12.0% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category resulted primarily from declines in the sales of flat panel televisions, digital cameras and camcorders, and navigation products. The 0.8% comparable store sales decline in the home office revenue category resulted primarily from comparable store sales declines in computer monitors and accessories, partially offset by gains in the sales of notebook computers and mobile phones. The 12.4% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment revenue category reflected a decrease in the sales of video gaming hardware and software and continued decreases in sales of DVDs and CDs. The 7.3% comparable store sales gain in the appliances revenue category resulted from increases in the sales of major appliances and small electrics, notably within our Canada and China operations where promotions and temporary government stimulus programs in China helped to fuel stronger sales. The 6.2% comparable store sales gain in the services revenue category was due primarily to an increase in revenue from our product repair business. Our International segment experienced gross profit growth of $755 million in fiscal 2010, or 31.7%, driven predominantly by the acquisition of Best Buy Europe. The acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe of 1.4% of revenue was the principal driver behind the International segments 1.4% of revenue gross profit rate increase for fiscal 2010, with an additional 0.2% of revenue increase from gross profit rate improvements in Europe due primarily to negotiation of more favorable vendor terms across the European business in the second half of fiscal 2010. An increase in Canadas gross profit rate also contributed a 0.1% of revenue increase. Offsetting these increases to the International segments gross profit rate was a 0.3% of revenue decrease from China due primarily to heavier promotions and clearances. 48  Table of Contents Our International segments SG&A grew 30.2%, or an increase of $682 million. In the first six months of fiscal 2010, Europes SG&A spend was $775 million with no comparable expenses in the same period one year ago. Europes lower SG&A in the last six months of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period one year ago partially offset the first half year over year increase. New store start up costs in Mexico and Turkey also increased SG&A, while SG&A spend in Canada and China remained relatively flat in fiscal 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The acquisition impact of Best Buy Europe of 1.7% of revenue was the principal driver behind the International segments 1.1% of revenue SG&A rate increase for fiscal 2010. In addition, the deleveraging impact of the comparable store sales decline on payroll, benefits and overhead costs in Canada contributed a 0.2% of revenue increase. Start up costs, rent expense and incremental staffing for new store openings in Mexico and Turkey further contributed a 0.3% of revenue increase to the International segments SG&A rate. Offsetting these increases in the SG&A rate was a 0.8% of revenue decrease in Europe in the second half of fiscal 2010, due in part to lower payroll costs stemming from their restructuring in the fiscal first quarter, as well as a 0.3% of revenue decrease in China, caused primarily by cost cutting measures to reduce overhead, payroll and marketing expenses. The increase in our International segments operating income resulted primarily from higher operating income in Europe and China, partially offset by increased new store investments in Mexico and Turkey, $27 million of restructuring charges and slightly lower operating income in Canada. Our International segments operating income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first fiscal quarter, compared to $6 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were related primarily to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs at Best Buy Europe, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges were employee termination benefits in our Canada business. Additional Consolidated Results Other Income (Expense) Our investment income and other in fiscal 2011 was $51 million, compared to $54 and $35 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The relatively flat investment income in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was principally the result of lower returns on our deferred compensation assets, partially offset by the gain on the sale of our former Speakeasy business in fiscal 2011. The increase in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the gains we recorded in fiscal 2010 on our deferred compensation assets, which experienced better returns when compared to the prior year. Gains on these assets have no impact on our net earnings, as they are offset by expense recorded within SG&A. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of lower interest rates earned on our cash and investment balances in fiscal 2010. Interest expense in fiscal 2011 was $87 million, compared to $94 million in both fiscal 2010 and 2009. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010, was the result of lower average short term borrowings throughout fiscal 2011, partially offset by higher average interest rates on outstanding short term borrowings. The relatively flat interest expense from fiscal 2009 to 2010 was the result of lower average short term borrowings during the year, which was fully offset by a full year of higher interest bearing long term debt. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate ("ETR") was 34.4% in fiscal 2011, compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2010 and 39.6% in fiscal 2009. The decrease in the ETR in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to the impact of increased tax benefits from foreign operations, tax benefits resulting from the sale of our former Speakeasy business and the favorable resolution of certain non recurring items. Excluding the impact of various fiscal 2011 non recurring items, the ETR would have been approximately 36.5%. The decrease in the ETR in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due principally to the fiscal 2009 impacts of the other than temporary impairment of our investment in the common stock of CPW and the non deductibility of our $62 million goodwill impairment charge, as well as the favorable net impact of certain discrete foreign tax matters in the 49 Table of Contents third quarter of fiscal 2010. Excluding the impact of the fiscal 2010 discrete foreign tax matters, the fiscal 2010 ETR would have been 38.3%. Additionally, excluding the impact of the fiscal 2009 impairment charges, the fiscal 2009 ETR would have been 36.8%. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The increase in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to the higher net earnings of Best Buy Europe, in which Carphone Warehouse Group plc has a 50% noncontrolling interest. The increase in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to having a full year of earnings from Best Buy Europe in fiscal 2010, as we did not acquire Best Buy Europe until the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products limited our ability to increase our gross profit rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We continue to closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. The key variables we use to manage liquidity requirements and investments to support our growth strategies include discretionary SG&A spending, capital expenditures, credit facilities and short term borrowing arrangements, working capital and our share repurchase program. Capital expenditures, particularly with respect to opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, is a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. In both fiscal 2011 and 2010, we moderated our capital spending in response to the challenging economic environment relative to our recent historical trend. We ended fiscal 2011 with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, compared to $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the $1.2 billion of cash utilized in fiscal 2011 to repurchase shares of our common stock, as well as decreased cash generated from operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $1.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2011, an increase from $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2010. Operating cash flow decreased 46.1% to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, while capital expenditures increased 21.0% to $744 million. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,190 $ 2,206 $ 1,877 Investing activities (569 ) (540 ) (3,427 ) Financing activities (1,357 ) (348 ) 591 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 13 10 19 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (723 ) $ 1,328 $ (940 ) 50 Table of Contents Operating Activities The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to an increase in cash used for accounts payable, as well as a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable. The increase in cash used for accounts payable was due primarily to the timing and level of inventory receipts compared to vendor payments as we approached fiscal 2011 year end. As we reduced inventory receipts in January and February 2011 in response to lower holiday sales trends, our total accounts payable declined. Cash used for inventory was also lower in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 because the fiscal 2011 year over year increase in inventory was lower than in the prior year due to focused efforts to manage inventory levels in light of comparable store sales declines. The decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable was due primarily to the timing of several large payments due from our vendors at the end of fiscal 2011. Other fluctuations in cash from operating activities were due primarily to higher incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2011 (relating to our fiscal 2010 performance) and other miscellaneous timing differences. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to increases in cash provided by net earnings, accounts receivable, other liabilities and accrued income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash used for merchandise inventories. The increase in cash provided by accounts receivable was due primarily to the timing of receipt of customer and network carrier receivables in our Europe business, as well as network carrier receivables associated with Best Buy Mobile in the U.S. The increases in cash provided by other liabilities were due primarily to the timing and magnitude of transaction taxes payable in various jurisdictions, as well as accrued bonuses. Finally, the increase in cash provided by accrued income taxes was due to the timing and magnitude of tax accruals as a result of higher net earnings. These changes were largely offset by the increase in cash used for merchandise inventories due to increased inventory levels in fiscal 2010, notably in notebook computers and flat panel televisions, as a result of increased consumer demand and a strengthening economy, compared to fiscal 2009 when we tightened inventory levels amidst a weaker economy and lower holiday sales. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was relatively flat in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, as an increase in cash used for capital expenditures was offset by an increase in cash provided by the sale of a portion of our auction rate securities ("ARS") during fiscal 2011. See Auction Rate Securities and Restricted Cash and Capital Expenditures below for additional information. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion of net cash associated with the acquisition of businesses in fiscal 2009, largely Best Buy Europe. Also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in capital expenditures to $615 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Financing Activities The increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of $1.2 billion of cash we used to repurchase our common stock in fiscal 2011. We had no repurchases in fiscal 2010. The change in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010, compared to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009, was primarily the result of a $1.1 billion decrease in borrowings, net of repayments, compared to the prior year. Larger borrowings in the prior year were associated with the acquisition of Best Buy Europe and normal working capital needs. In addition, our increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 allowed us to reduce our short term borrowings. Sources of Liquidity Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations and to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives in fiscal 2012. However, in the event our liquidity is 51 Table of Contents insufficient, we may be required to limit our future expansion plans or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms. We have a $2.3 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility, as amended (the "Credit Facility"), with a syndicate of banks, with no borrowings outstanding at February 26, 2011. The Credit Facility expires in September 2012. At April 20, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. We have $813 million available under secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities related to our International segment operations, of which $557 million was outstanding at February 26, 2011. We previously had a revolving credit line with UBS AG and its affiliates (collectively, "UBS") secured by the par value of our UBS brokered ARS. However, pursuant to the settlement described in Note 3, Investments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the revolving credit line expired by its terms during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 when UBS bought back all of our UBS brokered ARS. Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of our facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At February 26, 2011, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. If an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under our credit facilities as well. An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in Exhibit No. 12.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, was 5.78 and 6.08 in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our credit ratings and outlooks at April 20, 2011, are summarized below and are consistent with the ratings and outlooks reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended February 27, 2010. Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings Ltd. BBB+ Negative Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Baa2 Stable Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB Stable Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. We are not aware of any current circumstances which could cause our credit ratings to be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be downgraded. Auction Rate Securities and Restricted Cash At February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, we had $110 million and $280 million, respectively, invested in ARS recorded at fair value within short term investments and equity and other investments (long term) in our consolidated balance sheets. The majority of our ARS portfolio is AAA/Aaa rated and collateralized by student loans, which are guaranteed 95% to 100% by the U.S. government. Due to the auction failures that began in mid February 2008, we have been unable to liquidate some of our ARS. The investment principal associated with our ARS subject to failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, or final payments are due according to the contractual maturities of the debt issues, which range from five to 32 years. We intend to hold our ARS until we can recover the full principal amount through one of the means described above, and have the ability to do so based on our other sources of liquidity. 52 Table of Contents Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and customer warranty and insurance programs. Restricted cash and cash equivalents, which are included in other current assets, were $488 million and $482 million at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, respectively. Capital Expenditures A component of our long term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2011, we invested $744 million in property and equipment, including opening 147 new stores, expanding and remodeling certain stores, and upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities. The 21.0% increase in our capital expenditures compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to increased spending on information technology and additional store related projects. The following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 New stores $ 193 $ 229 $ 387 Store related projects(1) 208 90 333 Information technology 327 275 494 Other 16 21 89 Total capital expenditures(2) $ 744 $ 615 $ 1,303 (1)Includes store remodels and expansions, as well as various merchandising projects. (2)Total capital expenditures exclude non cash capital expenditures of $81, $9 and $42 for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Non cash capital expenditures are comprised of capitalized leases of $52, $9 and $35, as well as additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable of $29, $0 and $7, respectively, for each fiscal year. Refer to Note 13, Contingencies and Commitments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our significant commitments for capital expenditures at February 26, 2011. Debt and Capital 2013 Notes In June 2008, we sold $500 million principal amount of notes due July 15, 2013 (the "2013 Notes"). The 2013 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per year, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2009. The interest payable on the 2013 Notes is subject to adjustment if either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poors Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the 2013 Notes to below investment grade. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2013 Notes were $496 million, after an initial issuance discount of approximately $1 million and other transaction costs. We may redeem some or all of the 2013 Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and an applicable make whole amount as described in the indenture relating to the 2013 Notes. The 2013 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2013 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens, enter into sale and lease back transactions and, in the case of such subsidiaries, incur debt. 53 Table of Contents Convertible Debentures In January 2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402 million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 million in offering expenses, were $396 million. On January 15, 2007, the debentures became callable at par, at our option, for cash. The debentures mature in 2022. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on January 15, 2012, and again on January 15, 2017, if not previously redeemed, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. Since holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on January 15, 2012, we classified the debentures in the current portion of long term debt at February 26, 2011. The debentures become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30 trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. The debentures were not convertible at February 26, 2011, and have not been convertible through April 20, 2011. The debentures have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July 15, 2011, and July 15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the debentures. 2016 Notes and 2021 Notes Subsequent to fiscal 2011, we sold $350 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and $650 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (the "2021 Notes", and together with the 2016 Notes, the "Notes"). The 2016 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% per year, while the 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2011. The Notes were issued at a slight discount to par, which when coupled with underwriting discounts of $6 million, resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $990 million. We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest on the Notes redeemed discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes to the redemption date as described in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, unless we have previously exercised our option to redeem the Notes, we will be required to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and lease back transactions. Other At the end of fiscal 2011, we had $170 million outstanding under financing lease obligations. Share Repurchases and Dividends From time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity based incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital structure. 54 Table of Contents In June 2007, our Board authorized up to $5.5 billion in share repurchases. The program, which became effective on June 26, 2007, terminated and replaced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2006. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the June 2007 program. We repurchased and retired 32.6 million shares at a cost of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011. We made no share repurchases in fiscal 2010 or 2009. At the end of fiscal 2011, $1.3 billion of the $5.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2007 was available for future share repurchases. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of funding and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved by our Board under the June 2007 share repurchase program, we do not expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity. In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 8% to $0.14 per share, and maintained our cash dividend at that rate for the balance of fiscal 2009 and throughout fiscal 2010. We increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $0.15 per share effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2011, we made four cash dividend payments totaling $0.58 per share, or $237 million in the aggregate. Other Financial Measures Our debt to earnings ratio was 1.3 at the end of both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent ("EBITDAR") ratio, which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation, was 2.5 at the end of both fiscal 2011 and 2010, as an increase in operating lease obligations in fiscal 2011 was offset by an increase in the amount of depreciation and amortization (including impairments). Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is considered a non GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the most directly comparable ratio determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). We have included this information in our MD&A as we view the adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Furthermore, we believe that our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth. We also believe our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to that of retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owners desire to own or to lease the location, and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is calculated as follows: Adjusted debt to EBITDAR Adjusted debt EBITDAR 55  Table of Contents The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio, which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio ($ in millions): 2011(1) 2010(1) Debt (including current portion) $ 1,709 $ 1,802 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense)(2) 9,271 9,013 Adjusted debt $ 10,980 $ 10,815 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests(3) $ 1,366 $ 1,394 Interest expense, net 36 40 Income tax expense 714 802 Depreciation and amortization expense(4) 1,145 930 Rental expense 1,159 1,127 EBITDAR $ 4,420 $ 4,293 Debt to net earnings ratio 1.3 1.3 Adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio 2.5 2.5 (1)Debt is reflected as of the balance sheet dates for each of the respective fiscal year ends, while rental expense and the other components of EBITDAR represent activity for the 12 months ended as of each of the respective balance sheet dates. (2)The multiple of eight times annual rental expense in the calculation of our capitalized operating lease obligations is the multiple used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness, and we consider it to be an appropriate multiple for our lease portfolio. (3)We utilize net earnings including noncontrolling interests within our calculation as such net earnings and related cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests are available to service our debt and operating lease commitments. (4)Depreciation and amortization expense includes impairments of fixed assets, investments, goodwill and intangible assets (including impairments associated with our fiscal 2011 restructuring). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the "Contractual Obligations" table below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item 2, Properties, and Note 9, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 56 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Short term debt obligations $ 557 $ 557 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations 903 402 500 1 Capital lease obligations 79 14 27 20 18 Financing lease obligations 170 25 47 45 53 Interest payments 686 128 183 127 248 Operating lease obligations(1) 8,247 1,208 2,245 1,864 2,930 Purchase obligations(2) 1,989 1,135 446 393 15 Unrecognized tax benefits(3) 359 Deferred compensation(4) 64 Total $ 13,054 $ 3,469 $ 3,448 $ 2,449 $ 3,265 Note: For additional information refer to Note 6, Debt; Note 9, Leases; Note 11, Income Taxes and Note 13, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (1)Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $2.2 billion at February 26, 2011. (2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days. (3)Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting guidance that we adopted on March 4, 2007. As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table. (4)Included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at February 26, 2011, was a $64 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table. Additionally, we have $2.5 billion in undrawn capacity on our credit facilities at February 26, 2011, which if drawn upon, would be included as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board. 57 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory We value our inventory at the lower of the cost or market through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss adjustments. Our inventory valuation reflects markdowns for the excess of the cost over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis. Our inventory valuation also reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. Our markdown adjustment contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. Our inventory loss adjustment contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our markdown or inventory loss adjustments during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdowns. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdowns at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $12 million in fiscal 2011. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss adjustment. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory loss adjustments at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million in fiscal 2011. Vendor Allowances We receive funds from vendors for various programs, primarily as reimbursements for costs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and sales incentives. Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All other vendor allowances are generally in the form of receipt based funds or sell through credits. Receipt based funds are generally determined based on our level of inventory purchases and initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Sell through credits are generally based on the number of units we sell over a specified period and are recognized when the related product is sold. Based on the provisions of our vendor agreements, we develop vendor fund accrual rates by estimating the point at which we will have completed our performance under the agreement and the deferred amounts will be earned. During the year, due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical trends to ensure the deferred amounts earned are appropriately recorded. As a part of these analyses, we apply rates negotiated with our vendors to actual purchase volumes to determine the amount of funds accrued and receivable from the vendor. Certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to record different forms of vendor allowances or vendor receivables during the past three fiscal years. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially, either positively or negatively, impact our gross profit rate and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal year and all amounts deferred against inventory turnover within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require subjective long term estimates. Adjustments to our gross profit rate and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material. A 10% difference in our vendor receivables at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $22 million in fiscal 2011. 58 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Long Lived Assets Long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 59 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment. Our impairment evaluation involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value. We carry forward the detailed determination of the fair value of a reporting unit in our annual goodwill impairment analysis if three criteria are met: (1) the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination; (2) the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin; and (3) based on an analysis of events that have occurred since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote. For all other reporting units, we perform a detailed determination of fair value of the reporting unit. Our detailed impairment analysis involves the use of a discounted cash flow model. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. Critical assumptions include projected comparable store sales growth, store count, gross profit rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures and terminal growth rates, as well as an appropriate discount rate. We determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the capital asset pricing model. For fiscal 2011, such discount rates ranged from 8.5% to 12.5%. We also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our companys market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as our future expectations. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets during the past three fiscal years. The carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at February 26, 2011, were $2.5 billion and $105 million, respectively. In fiscal 2011, we identified no goodwill impairments. We determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units was substantial. As part of our fiscal 2011 restructuring, we recorded an impairment charge of $10 million related to certain indefinite lived tradenames in our Domestic segment We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. 60 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 61 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Revenue Recognition See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for amounts due from third parties that we do not expect to collect. We estimate the allowance based on historical write offs and chargebacks as well as aging trends. We sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores, through our Web sites and through selected third parties. A liability is initially established for the cash value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote ("gift card breakage"). We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which show that after 24 months, we can determine the portion of the liability for which redemption is remote. We have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed at any of our Best Buy branded stores, or through our related Web sites or when using our co branded credit cards in the U.S. and Canada. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at Best Buy branded stores and Web sites. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed. Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the amount and timing of future sales returns, uncollectible accounts and redemptions of gift cards and certificates. Our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns, uncollectible accounts and redemptions of gift cards and certificates is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to measure sales returns or doubtful accounts or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to measure sales returns and doubtful accounts or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales return reserve at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1 million in fiscal 2011. A 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2011. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $14 million in fiscal 2011. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program liability at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million in fiscal 2011. 62 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Costs Associated With Exit Activities We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations with remaining lease commitments, we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a risk free interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. The liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our location closing liability at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2011. Stock Based Compensation We have a stock based compensation plan, which includes non qualified stock options and nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Shareholders Equity, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs. We determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option pricing models. Non qualified stock option awards are primarily valued using a lattice model. We determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Performance based nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2011. 63 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general liability claims, as well as customer warranty and insurance programs, although we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. We maintain wholly owned insurance captives to manage a portion of these self insured liabilities. When estimating our self insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries. Periodically, we review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities. Our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at February 26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2011. Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. Noncontrolling interests proportionate ownership of assets and liabilities are recorded at historical carrying values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three fiscal years, we completed three significant acquisitions: In February 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in Five Star for $196 million, after having acquired a 75% interest in Five Star in June 2006. In October 2008, we acquired Napster for $122 million, including transaction costs. In June 2008, we acquired a 50% interest in Best Buy Europe for $2.2 billion, including transaction costs. See Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for the final purchase price allocations completed in fiscal 2010 for such acquisitions. New Accounting Standards Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance on the treatment of a consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIE") in response to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of pre existing guidance, including those regarding the transparency of an involvement with a VIE. Specifically, this new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In addition, this new guidance requires additional disclosures about an involvement with a VIE and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance on February 28, 2010 and determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 64 Table of Contents Transfers of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on the treatment of transfers of financial assets which eliminates the concept of a "qualifying special purpose entity," changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and an entitys continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance on February 28, 2010 and determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a limited basis, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our Canada and Europe businesses enter into the contracts primarily to hedge certain non functional currency transaction exposures. The aggregate notional amount related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, was $757 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. The fair value recorded on our consolidated balance sheet related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, was $(1) million and $4 million, respectively. The amount recorded in our consolidated statement of net earnings related to all contracts settled and outstanding was a gain of $24 million in fiscal 2011, and a loss of $1 million in fiscal 2010. The overall weakness of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar since the end of fiscal 2010 has had a positive overall impact on our revenue and net earnings as the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. However, the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the U.K. pound has had a negative overall impact on our revenue. It is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, the effect on reported revenue and net earnings can be estimated. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net favorable impact on our revenue and net earnings in fiscal 2011 of approximately $297 million and $6 million, respectively. Similarly, we estimate that the overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on our revenue and net earnings in fiscal 2010 of approximately $41 million and $12 million, respectively. Interest Rate Risk Short and long term debt At February 26, 2011, our short and long term debt was comprised primarily of credit facilities, our convertible debentures and our 2013 Notes. We do not manage the interest rate risk on our debt through the use of derivative instruments. Our credit facilities interest rates may be reset due to fluctuations in a market based index, such as the federal funds rate, LIBOR, or the base rate or prime rate of our lenders. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates on the outstanding balance of our credit facilities at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, would change our annual pre tax earnings by $6 million and $7 million, respectively. There is no interest rate risk associated with our convertible debentures or 2013 Notes, as the interest rates are fixed at 2.25% and 6.75%, respectively, per annum. 65  Table of Contents Long term investments in debt securities At February 26, 2011, our long term investments in debt securities were comprised of ARS. These investments are not subject to material interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate on such investments at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, would change our annual pre tax earnings by $1 million and $3 million, respectively. We do not manage interest rate risk on our investments in debt securities through the use of derivative instruments. Other Market Risks Investments in auction rate securities At February 26, 2011, we held $110 million in investments in ARS, which includes a $5 million pre tax temporary impairment, compared to $280 million in investments in ARS and a $5 million pre tax temporary impairment at February 27, 2010. Given current conditions in the ARS market as described above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we may incur additional temporary unrealized losses or other than temporary realized losses in the future if market conditions were to persist and we were unable to recover the cost of our ARS investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point loss from the par value of these investments at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, would result in an impairment of $1 million and $3 million, respectively.
