Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A is presented in seven sections:OverviewBusiness Strategy and Core PhilosophiesResults of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOff Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsCritical Accounting EstimatesNew Accounting StandardsOur MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2012 included 53 weeks and fiscal 2011 and 2010 each included 52 weeks.On November 2, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from the Saturday nearest the end of February to the Saturday nearest the end of January, effective beginning with our fiscal year 2013. As a result of this change, our fiscal year 2013 transition period will be 11 months and will end on February 2, 2013, and we will begin consolidating the results of our Europe, China and Mexico operations on a one month lag, compared to a two month lag in fiscal year 2012, to continue aligning our fiscal reporting periods with statutory filing requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions. We will begin filing our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q based on the new fiscal year end beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. 32Table of ContentsWe also currently plan to report the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 as a three month period, which will include the results of the last month of fiscal year 2012. OverviewWe are a multi national retailer of consumer electronics, computing and mobile phone products, entertainment products, appliances and related services. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of all operations within the U.S. and its territories. The International segment is comprised of all operations outside the U.S. and its territories.Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Europe and Canada, than in any other fiscal quarter.While some of the products and services we offer are viewed by consumers as essential, others are viewed as discretionary purchases. Consequently, our results of operations are susceptible to changes in consumer confidence levels and macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, consumer credit availability and the condition of the housing market. Consumers have maintained a cautious approach to discretionary spending due to continued economic pressures. Consequently, customer traffic and spending patterns continue to be difficult to predict. Other factors that directly impact our performance are product life cycles (including the introduction and adoption of new technology) and the competitive retail environment for our products and services. As a result of these factors, predicting our future revenue and net earnings is difficult. By providing access to a wide selection of products and accessories; a vast array of service offerings, such as extended warranties, installation and repair; an integrated multi channel approach; and a knowledgeable sales staff to help our customers select their devices and access related services and content, we believe we offer our customers a differentiated value proposition. Disciplined capital allocation, working capital management and expense control remain key priorities for us as we navigate through the current environment.Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales is a commonly used metric in the retail industry, which compares revenue for a particular period with the corresponding period in the prior year, excluding the impact of sales from new stores opened. Our comparable store sales is comprised of revenue from stores operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to call centers, Web sites and our other comparable sales channels. Revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers or dealers is not included within our comparable store sales calculation. Relocated, remodeled and expanded stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The portion of our calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change attributable to our International segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. The calculation of comparable store sales excludes the impact of the extra week of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, as well as revenue from discontinued operations.In our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segments operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates. We use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. In our discussions of the operating results below, we sometimes refer to the impact of net new stores on our results of operations. The key factors that dictate the impact that the net new stores have on our operating results include: (i) the size and format of new stores, as we operate stores ranging from approximately 1,000 square feet to approximately 50,000 square feet; (ii) the length of time the stores were open during the period; and (iii) the overall success of new store launches.33Table of ContentsBusiness Strategy and Core PhilosophiesIn recent years, the consumer electronics industry experienced limited new product innovation in many key product categories, such as televisions, computers and gaming. At the same time, consumers have enjoyed greater price transparency and easier comparison shopping. These factors have combined with a continuation of economic pressure weighing on many consumers. In response to these circumstances, we have accelerated our cost reduction efforts, adjusted our sales mix and focused on improving the experience we offer our customers.Last year, we took important steps to begin transforming our company and focusing on strategies we believed offer the best opportunities to improve returns. We significantly restructured our International business, closing our large format Best Buy branded stores in China, Turkey and the U.K. when it became clear that they would not deliver returns consistent with our expectations and timelines. We also agreed to buy out the Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee paid to Best Buy Europe pursuant to the 2007 Best Buy Mobile agreement (the profit share agreement). The buy out of the profit share agreement allows us to more fully capitalize on what we believe is the growing connections opportunities related to devices and connection services in the U.S. and Canada.We are currently focused on four initiatives to continue to drive the transformation of our company, all of which are focused on improving our financial performance:Multi year Cost Reductions;U.S. Store Format Improvements;Growth Initiatives; andImproved Customer Experience.Multi year Cost Reductions. We are taking several actions to lower our cost structure in certain areas of our business. These actions are intended not only to help us be more efficient, but also to allow for current investments in our initiatives designed to grow earnings over the long term. We plan to redirect our financial resources to invest in enhancements to the customer experience and in investment opportunities that will provide the greatest returns. In total, we expect to reduce costs in targeted areas by $800 million by fiscal 2015 with $250 million of the cost reductions expected to be realized in fiscal 2013. These planned reductions primarily fall into three areas: Retail stores including the closure of approximately 50 large format Best Buy stores in the U.S. in fiscal 2013;Corporate and support structure savings from information technology services, procurement savings on non merchandise purchases, reduction in consulting services and reduction in corporate and support positions; and Cost of goods sold reduction of product transition costs, lower product return and exchange expenses and supply chain efficiencies.U.S. Store Format Improvements. We are revising our portfolio of store formats to improve the customer experience and to improve store performance and productivity. In the immediate term, this will involve closing some large format Best Buy branded stores, modifying others to our pilot Connected Store format, and adding more small format Best Buy Mobile stand alone stores. The Connected Stores will be remodeled large format stores that focus on connections, services and an enhanced multi channel experience through a total transformation of both the physical store and the operating model. As we continue to focus on making it easier for customers to shop with us anywhere, any time and any way they want we are increasing our points of presence, while decreasing overall square footage, which we believe will result in increased profit per square foot.Growth Initiatives. From an investment standpoint, we will continue to prioritize the opportunities in existing businesses through four key growth initiatives: e commerce, connections, services and China. We expect these initiatives to benefit our overall financial performance.To continue to drive the growth of our e commerce platform, we are focused on improving the customer experience by providing more competitive online pricing, broader use of free shipping, the expansion of our online assortment and the further development of the Best Buy Marketplace, which significantly expanded the range of assortment, price points and brands available to our customers.We will continue to focus on growing connections, not only from Best Buy Mobile, but from other parts of our business. While we believe Best Buy Mobile will remain an important driver of our connections performance, we plan to leverage our mobile connections expertise for other devices including tablets, notebooks and e Readers to drive increased attachments of connections, accessories and services. We see the wide range of services we can offer our customers as a key differentiator and an area with growth potential. Our growth initiatives will include: (i) refining our extended product support services with tailored programs for 34Table of Contentscertain products, such as mobile phones and tablets; (ii) expanding the range of our services to customers both in our stores and remotely; and (iii) further increasing our service revenue from small and medium sized business customers, including through our mindSHIFT acquisition.In China, we will continue to grow our Five Star business through approximately 50 new store openings and the introduction of the Best Buy Mobile store within a store concept during fiscal 2013. Improved Customer Experience. Delivering outstanding experiences to our customers is a constant area of focus, and we believe the strength of those experiences is an important differentiator for us. We continuously search for ways to improve our customer interactions, whether in store, online or in customers homes. For example, our recently announced Perfect Match Promise is based on a strategic message that we believe is important to customers: 30 days of free telephone support to assist customers in using their products; 30 days of easy returns with no restocking fees; and 30 days of competitor price matching. In fiscal 2013, we also plan to enhance our Reward Zone loyalty program for premier level members. These enhancements include: free expedited shipping; premier access to new technology, popular products and sales events; a free house call from a Geek Squad agent; and extended returns and price match benefits.In order to support our focus on improving customer experience, we also plan to introduce enhanced training, recognition and reward programs which will sharpen our employees focus on delivering outstanding customer experiences.Results of OperationsIn order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions, we consolidate the financial results of our Europe, China and Mexico operations on a two month lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non financial information presented in our MD&A relative to these operations is also presented on a two month lag.Our policy is to accelerate the recording of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. In November 2011, we announced plans to close our large format Best Buy branded stores in the U.K. However, a portion of the charges were not recorded until the stores were closed in January 2012. Accordingly, $82 million of restructuring charges recorded by Best Buy Europe in January 2012 related to the store closures were included in our fiscal 2012 results. Furthermore, in January 2012, we determined that the goodwill attributable to our Best Buy Europe reporting unit had been fully impaired. Accordingly, we recorded the $1,207 million impairment charge in our fiscal 2012 results. Except for these restructuring activities and the goodwill impairment, no significant intervening event occurred in these operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2012.Discontinued Operations PresentationDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we began presenting the results of our large format Best Buy branded stores in China, Turkey and the U.K., The Phone House retail stores in Belgium, Napster and Speakeasy as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The discontinued operations presentation has been retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented. Unless otherwise stated, financial results discussed herein refer to continuing operations.Fiscal 2012 SummaryFiscal 2012 included a net loss of $1.2 billion from total operations (including both continuing and discontinued operations), compared to net earnings of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011. The net loss in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to our decision to buy out of the Best Buy Mobile profit share agreement for $1.3 billion (the "Mobile buy out"), as well as the resulting $1.2 billion goodwill impairment in our Best Buy Europe reporting unit. Loss per diluted share from total operations was $3.36 in fiscal 2012, compared to earnings per diluted share of $3.08 in fiscal 2011.Revenue increased 1.9% to $50.7 billion. The increase was driven primarily by the net addition of 235 new stores during fiscal 2012, an extra week of revenue from stores in our Domestic segment and Canada, and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.7%.Our gross profit rate decreased by 0.4% of revenue to 24.8% of revenue. The decrease was driven by a decline in our Domestic segments gross profit rate primarily due to increased promotional activity and an increased sales mix of promotional items.35Table of ContentsIn fiscal 2012, we recorded $58 million of restructuring charges related to changes in our mobile broadband offerings and actions to improve supply chain and operational efficiencies in our Domestic segment, as well as changes in our international expansion strategy in the International segment.We ended fiscal 2012 with $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2011. Operating cash flow increased to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 operating cash flow of $1.2 billion due primarily to changes in working capital, as capital expenditures remained relatively consistent at $766 million in fiscal 2012.During fiscal 2012, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.62 per share, or $228 million in the aggregate.We repurchased and retired 54.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1.5 billion during fiscal 2012.Consolidated ResultsThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts):Consolidated Performance Summary2012(1) 2011 2010Revenue$50,705 $49,747 $49,243Revenue gain %1.9 % 1.0 % 10.1%Comparable store sales % (decline) gain(1.7)% (1.8)% 0.6%Gross profit$12,573 $12,541 $12,042Gross profit as % of revenue(2)24.8 % 25.2 % 24.5%SG&A$10,242 $10,029 $9,622SG&A as % of revenue(2)20.2 % 20.2 % 19.5%Restructuring charges$39 $138 $52Operating income$1,085 $2,374 $2,368Operating income as % of revenue2.1 % 4.8 % 4.8%Net (loss) earnings from continuing operations(3)$(1,057) $1,427 $1,399Loss from discontinued operations(4)$(174) $(150) $(82)Net (loss) earnings attributable to Best Buy Co., Inc.$(1,231) $1,277 $1,317Diluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations$(2.89) $3.44 $3.29Diluted (loss) earnings per share$(3.36) $3.08 $3.10(1)Included within operating income and net loss for fiscal 2012 is a $1.2 billion ($1.2 billion net of taxes) goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charge resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 2.4% of revenue for the fiscal year.(2)Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A"), our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.(3)Includes both Net (loss) earnings from continuing operations and Net (earnings) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests.(4)Includes both Loss from discontinued operations and Net loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests.Fiscal 2012 Results Compared With Fiscal 2011The macroeconomic pressures on consumer spending and the consumer electronics industry trends we experienced in fiscal 2011 largely continued through fiscal 2012. We continued to face declining demand in key product categories, particularly televisions, notebook computers, gaming and music. These factors have impacted many of the geographic markets in which we operate. However, we have seen growth in several key product categories. For example, increased consumer demand for tablets, e Readers, and associated accessories and services led to revenue growth of these products in all of our global markets. Further, our focus on gaining market share in appliances in the Domestic segment produced comparable stores sales gains in fiscal 2012.36Table of ContentsThe components of the 1.9% revenue increase in fiscal 2012 were as follows:Net new stores1.6 %Extra week of revenue(1)1.5 %Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations0.9 %Comparable store sales impact(1.6)%Non comparable sales channels(2)(0.5)%Total revenue increase1.9 %(1)Represents the incremental revenue associated with stores in our Domestic segment and Canada in fiscal 2012, which had 53 weeks of activity, compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011.(2)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.Our gross profit rate decreased 0.4% of revenue in fiscal 2012. A gross profit rate decline in our Domestic segment accounted for a decrease of 0.5% of revenue, which was partially offset by a 0.1% of revenue increase in our International segment. For further discussion of each segments gross profit rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.The flat SG&A rate in fiscal 2012 was due to a 0.1% of revenue decrease attributable to the decrease in our Domestic segments SG&A rate, offset by a 0.1% of revenue increase attributable to the increase in our International segments SG&A rate. For further discussion of each segments SG&A rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.We recorded restructuring charges of $58 million in fiscal 2012, which included $19 million of inventory write downs recorded in cost of goods sold. Our Domestic segment recorded $43 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2012, and our International segment recorded $15 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2012. These restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2012 of 0.1% of revenue. For further discussion of each segments restructuring charges, see Segment Performance Summary, below.Our operating income decreased $1,289 million, or 54.3%, and our operating income rate decreased to 2.1% of revenue in fiscal 2012, compared to 4.8% of revenue in fiscal 2011. The 2.7% of revenue operating income rate decrease was driven primarily by a non cash impairment charge of $1,207 million to write off the goodwill related to our Best Buy Europe reporting unit and a decrease in our gross profit rate, partially offset by decreased restructuring charges. Our operating income in fiscal 2012 included $58 million of restructuring charges, compared to $147 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2011.Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010Throughout fiscal 2011, the majority of geographic markets in which we operate generally continued to endure difficult and uncertain economic conditions. In addition, customer appetite for certain product categories was below industry expectations. Both of these factors had a direct bearing on our revenue. We responded to the economic environment by closely managing our SG&A, as well as focusing on efforts to improve our gross profit.The 1.0% revenue increase in fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from the net addition of 137 new stores during fiscal 2011 and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline.The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2011 were as follows:Net new stores2.4 %Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations0.6 %Comparable store sales impact(1.7)%One less week of revenue for Best Buy Europe(1)(0.2)%Non comparable sales channels(2)(0.1)%Total revenue increase1.0 %(1)Represents the incremental revenue associated with Best Buy Europe in fiscal 2010, which had 53 weeks of activity, compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011.(2)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.37Table of ContentsOur gross profit rate increased 0.7% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Gross profit rate improvements in our Domestic segment accounted for an increase of 0.7% of revenue. The relatively flat gross profit rate in our International segment had no impact on the consolidated gross profit rate. For further discussion of each segments gross profit rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.The 0.7% of revenue SG&A rate increase for fiscal 2011 was due to a 0.8% of revenue increase attributable to the increase in our Domestic segments SG&A rate, partially offset by a 0.1% of revenue decrease attributable to the decrease in our International segments SG&A rate. For further discussion of each segments SG&A rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.We recorded restructuring charges of $147 million in fiscal 2011, which included $9 million of inventory write downs recorded in cost of goods sold. Our Domestic segment recorded $40 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2011, and our International segment recorded $107 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2011. These restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2011 of 0.3% of revenue. For further discussion of each segments restructuring charges, see Segment Performance Summary, below.Our operating income and our operating income rate remained flat in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The operating income rate was driven by an increase in our gross profit rate, offset by an increase in our SG&A rate and increased restructuring charges. Our operating income in fiscal 2011 included $147 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $52 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. Segment Performance SummaryDomesticThe following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions):Domestic Segment Performance Summary2012 2011 2010Revenue$37,615 $37,070 $37,138Revenue gain (decline) %1.5 % (0.2)% 6.3%Comparable store sales (decline) gain %(1.6)% (3.0)% 1.7%Gross profit$9,186 $9,314 $8,964Gross profit as % of revenue24.4 % 25.1 % 24.1%SG&A$7,307 $7,229 $6,836SG&A as % of revenue19.4 % 19.5 % 18.4%Restructuring charges$24 $31 $25Operating income$1,855 $2,054 $2,103Operating income as % of revenue4.9 % 5.5 % 5.7%The following table reconciles our Domestic segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years: Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2012 Total Storesat End ofFiscal Year StoresOpened StoresClosed Total Storesat End ofFiscal Year StoresOpened StoresClosed Total Storesat End ofFiscal YearBest Buy1,069 31 (1) 1,099 7 (3) 1,103Best Buy Mobile stand alone74 103 177 128 305Pacific Sales35 35 (1) 34Magnolia Audio Video6 6 (1) 5Geek Squad6 (6) Total Domestic segment stores1,190 134 (7) 1,317 135 (5) 1,44738Table of ContentsFiscal 2012 Results Compared With Fiscal 2011In fiscal 2012, the results of our Domestic segment were impacted by both macroeconomic factors and also specific consumer electronics industry challenges. The U.S. continued to face an unsteady recovery from the economic turbulence that began in late 2008, which has led to a constrained, and thus more price and value conscious consumer. The changes in consumer behaviors, coupled with product life cycle declines in televisions, gaming and notebook computers, resulted in a comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2012. We have, however, benefited from product innovation and strong consumer interest in products such as tablets, e Readers and mobile phones, which all experienced sales growth in fiscal 2012. In addition, our focus on growing our market share in appliances led to sales growth throughout fiscal 2012.In light of continued strong competition in the consumer electronics industry and greater price transparency for customers, we increased our promotional activity, especially during the holiday season, to drive market share gains and customer traffic. While we believe these actions were effective in driving our overall results, they also contributed to a gross profit rate decline.The components of the 1.5% revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2012 were as follows:Extra week of revenue(1)1.8 %Net new stores1.3 %Comparable store sales impact(1.6)%Total revenue increase1.5 %(1)Represents the incremental revenue associated with stores in our Domestic segment in fiscal 2012, which had 53 weeks of activity, compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011.The impact of net new stores on our revenue is a result of net store changes during the past 12 months, as well as stores opened in the prior fiscal year that are not included in comparable store sales due to the timing of their opening. The addition of large format Best Buy branded stores contributed the majority of the total change in revenue associated with net new stores. The addition of small format Best Buy Mobile stand alone stores contributed a smaller portion of the revenue increase due to the following factors: (1) their smaller square footage; (2) their limited category focus compared to our large format stores; and (3) the majority of fiscal 2012 openings taking place in the second half of the fiscal year.The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2012 and 2011: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended March 3, 2012 February 26, 2011 March 3, 2012 February 26, 2011Consumer Electronics36% 37% (5.4)% (6.3)%Computing and Mobile Phones(1)40% 37% 6.0 % 3.6 %Entertainment12% 14% (16.3)% (13.3)%Appliances5% 5% 10.6 % 7.0 %Services6% 6% (0.6)% 0.5 %Other1% 1% n/a n/aTotal100% 100% (1.6)% (3.0)%(1)During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the revenue category previously referred to as "Home Office" was renamed "Computing and Mobile Phones" to more clearly reflect the key products included within the revenue category. However, the composition of the products within this revenue category has not changed from the previous periods disclosures.The following is a description of the notable comparable store sales changes in our Domestic segment by revenue category:Consumer Electronics: The 5.4% comparable store sales decline was driven primarily by decreases in the sales of digital imaging products and televisions. The decrease in digital imaging products resulted from a combination of supply chain constraints due to natural disasters in Asia in both the early and later portions of the fiscal year, as well as overall industry softness. The decrease in television sales was mainly due to a decline in average selling price. The declines were partially offset by strong sales of e Readers due to high customer interest, new product launches and our broad assortment of such products.39Table of ContentsComputing and Mobile Phones: The 6.0% comparable store sales gain resulted primarily from increased sales of tablets, as consumer demand remained strong, and mobile phones due to new product launches in the second half of the year. The strong performance from tablets and mobile phones was partially offset by a decline in sales of notebook computers.Entertainment: The 16.3% comparable stores sales decline was mainly the result of a decline in gaming due to overall industry softness, particularly in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continued to experience declines in the sales of movies and music.Appliances: The 10.6% comparable store sales gain was primarily due to increased sales resulting from effective promotional activity.Services: The 0.6% comparable store sales decline was primarily due to a decrease in computer services as a result of a shift in focus from one time repair services to ongoing technical support service contracts, partially offset by increases in the sales of repair services (primarily related to mobile phones) and warranties.Our Domestic segment experienced a decrease in gross profit of $128 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, due to a decline in the gross profit rate. The 0.7% of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate resulted primarily from the following factors:increased promotional activity, notably in televisions, movies and gaming;an increased sales mix of promotional items; a shift from one time computer repair services to ongoing support contracts; andan increased sales mix of lower margin mobile computing products; partially offset by increased sales of higher margin service products for mobile phones.Our Domestic segments SG&A grew $78 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in SG&A was driven by an extra week of operations in fiscal 2012, which had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of the extra week, our Domestic segments SG&A declined, as increased costs driven by the opening of new stores and increased advertising were more than offset by decreases in compensation costs, a decrease in the Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee due to strategic changes at Best Buy Europe and reduced spending on third party services. The Domestic segments SG&A rate remained relatively flat in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. For further information on the strategic changes at Best Buy Europe, see Additional Consolidated Results, below.Our Domestic segment recorded $43 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2012, which included $19 million of inventory write downs included in cost of goods sold. The restructuring charges consisted of property and equipment impairments related to changes in our mobile broadband offerings, as well as inventory write downs and facility closure costs related primarily to activities we undertook to improve supply chain and operational efficiencies in our Domestic segment. These restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2012 of 0.1% of revenue. Our Domestic segment recorded restructuring charges of $40 million, including $9 million of inventory write downs included in cost of goods sold, in fiscal 2011. The restructuring charges resulted from activities to improve supply chain and operational efficiencies and included charges for employee termination benefits, property and equipment impairments and inventory write downs.The $199 million decrease in our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2012 was principally the result of a decrease in gross profit due to a decline in the gross profit rate and higher SG&A spending, partially offset by an increase in revenue. Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010Our Domestic segments gross profit improved in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, with a continued rate improvement partially offset by a revenue decline. These factors, combined with an increase in SG&A and restructuring charges, led to a modest decline in operating income.We believe the revenue decline resulted primarily from a combination of weakness in several key consumer electronics industry product categories and a decline in our estimated domestic market share. Consumers continue to be highly selective and cautious about how and when they make consumer electronics purchases. As a specialty retailer in the consumer electronics industry, the adoption of new technologies and the timing of product life cycles continue to play an important role in revenue trends. For example, the demand for new television technologies did not materialize as the industry anticipated. Similarly, we saw a shift in consumer demand within mobile computing, as increased sales of tablets resulted in a lower overall sales mix of notebook computers throughout fiscal 2011.40Table of ContentsThe components of our Domestic segments 0.2% revenue decrease in fiscal 2011 were as follows:Comparable store sales impact(2.9)%Net new stores2.7 %Total revenue decrease(0.2)%The impact of net new stores on our revenue is a result of net store changes during the past 12 months, as well as stores opened in the prior fiscal year that are not included in comparable store sales due to the timing of their opening. The net addition of large format Best Buy branded stores, including 30 stores in fiscal 2011, contributed the majority of the total change in revenue associated with net new stores. The addition of small format Best Buy Mobile stand alone stores, including 103 in fiscal 2011, contributed a smaller portion of the revenue increase due to their smaller square footage and limited category focus compared to our large format stores.The following table presents the Domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2011 and 2010: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 26, 2011 February 27, 2010 February 26, 2011 February 27, 2010Consumer Electronics37% 39% (6.3)% 1.1 %Computing and Mobile Phones(1)37% 34% 3.6 % 12.8 %Entertainment14% 16% (13.3)% (13.2)%Appliances5% 4% 7.0 % (4.2)%Services6% 6% 0.5 % (1.0)%Other1% 1% n/a n/aTotal100% 100% (3.0)% 1.7 %(1)During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the revenue category previously referred to as "Home Office" was renamed "Computing and Mobile Phones" to more clearly reflect the key products included within the revenue category. However, the composition of the products within this revenue category has not changed from the previous periods disclosures.The products having the largest impact on our comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2011 were entertainment hardware and software (which includes video gaming hardware and software, CDs and DVDs) and televisions. Comparable store sales gains in mobile phones, mobile computing (consisting of notebook computers, netbooks and tablets) partially offset these declines. Revenue from our Domestic segments online operations increased 13% in fiscal 2011 and is incorporated in the table above.The following is a description of the notable comparable store sales changes in our Domestic segment by revenue category:Consumer Electronics: The 6.3% comparable store sales decline was driven primarily by a decrease in the sales of televisions and cameras and camcorders, partially offset by strong sales from our expanded assortment of e Readers.Computing and Mobile Phones: The 3.6% comparable store sales gain was primarily the result of increased sales of mobile phones due to the continued growth of Best Buy Mobile, as well as gains in the sales of mobile computing.Entertainment: The 13.3% comparable store sales decline was mainly the result of declining sales in video gaming hardware and software, partially caused by industry wide softness combined with a decline in our market share, as well as the continued decline in the sales of DVDs and CDs as consumers shift to digital content.Appliances: The 7.0% comparable store sales gain was due to an increase in unit sales with relatively flat average selling prices, with particular strength in kitchen and small appliances.Services: The 0.5% comparable store sales gain was due primarily to a gain in the sales of computer services, partially offset by a decline in the sales of repair and home theater installation services, due in part to the decrease in television sales noted above.41Table of ContentsDespite a modest decline in revenue, our Domestic segment experienced gross profit growth in fiscal 2011 of $350 million, or 3.9%, compared to fiscal 2010, due to rate improvements. The 1.0% of revenue increase in the gross profit rate was due to favorable rate and mix impacts of 0.7% of revenue and 0.3% of revenue, respectively, and resulted primarily from the following factors collectively:increased sales of higher margin mobile phones as a result of the growth in Best Buy Mobile;a change in the form of vendor funding for fiscal 2011, shifting more dollars to gross profit than SG&A; andimproved attachment of services, particularly in the mobile computing product category;partially offset by declining average selling prices of televisions.Our Domestic segments SG&A grew $393 million, or 5.7%, in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in SG&A was driven by the opening of new stores and an increase in the Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The following factors collectively contributed to the Domestic segments SG&A rate increase of 1.1% of revenue:deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline;continued growth in Best Buy Mobile (including the profit share based management fee we paid to Best Buy Europe, which is offset in the International segment SG&A results and, therefore, has no net impact on our consolidated operating income); andthe change in the form of vendor funding as discussed above;partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs.Our Domestic segment recorded $40 million of restructuring charge, including $9 million of inventory write downs, in fiscal 2011, compared to $25 million recorded in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 restructuring charges resulted from activities to improve supply chain and operational efficiencies and included charges for employee termination benefits, property and equipment impairments and inventory write downs. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges related primarily to updating our U.S. Best Buy store operating model, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions for which we incurred employee termination costs.The $49 million decrease in our Domestic segments operating income for fiscal 2011 was due to a modest decline in revenue, higher SG&A spending, and an increase in restructuring charges, partially offset by increased gross profit due to an improvement in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segments operating income in fiscal 2011 included $40 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $25 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010.

We completed the exit of our large format Best Buy branded stores in the China and Turkey markets, which we had announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and re focused our Best Buy Europe strategy by closing our large format Best Buy branded stores in the U.K. to focus on our small format stores. We also completed the Mobile buy out in fiscal 2012, which will allow us to fully benefit from growing connections opportunities in the U.S. and Canada. In fiscal 2013, we plan to focus internationally on our existing markets of Canada, China and Mexico, as well as small format stores in Europe. Notable store opening plans in fiscal 2013 include approximately 50 new Five Star stores in the growing China market.The International segment comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2012 was led primarily by declines in mobile phones as a result of market pressure in Europe and continued market softness in gaming in Canada. However, we experienced some positive results, including comparable store sales gains in tablets throughout the segment, as well as gains in mobile phones in Canada and our Five Star operations. In addition, Five Star appliance sales benefited from continued government stimulus programs, which effectively ended in December 2011. While we believe the stimulus programs were a significant driver of appliance sales, it is not possible to quantify the impact that the expiration of the programs may have on our future results. Our operating loss was driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charge within our Best Buy Europe reporting unit triggered by the Mobile buy out in the fourth quarter, which more than offset the margin improvements, particularly within key product categories in Canada, and the decrease in restructuring charges in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.The components of the International segments 3.3% revenue increase in fiscal 2012 were as follows:Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations3.6 %Net new stores2.6 %Extra week of revenue(1)0.6 %Comparable store sales impact(1.8)%Non comparable sales channels(2)(1.7)%Total revenue increase3.3 %(1)Reflects the incremental revenue associated with stores in Canada in fiscal 2012, which had 53 weeks of activity, compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011.(2)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.The net addition of 49 large format stores throughout the International segment during the past 12 months (Five Star, Best Buy Canada, Future Shop and Best Buy Mexico) contributed the majority of the change in revenue associated with net new stores. The net addition of 56 small format stores, including 20 new small format Best Buy Mobile stand alone stores in Canada and 36 net new small format stores in Europe had a significantly smaller impact on the overall revenue change given their smaller square footage compared to our large format stores. 43Table of ContentsThe following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2012 and 2011: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended March 3, 2012 February 26, 2011 March 3, 2012 February 26, 2011Consumer Electronics20% 20% (6.9)% (2.8)%Computing and Mobile Phones(1)56% 55% 0.0 % 4.9 %Entertainment5% 6% (13.3)% (12.4)%Appliances10% 9% 4.5 % 15.8 %Services9% 10% (1.3)% (1.6)%Other&lt;1% &lt;1% n/a n/aTotal100% 100% (2.1)% 2.3 %(1)During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the revenue category previously referred to as "Home Office" was renamed "Computing and Mobile Phones" to more clearly reflect the key products included within the revenue category. However, the composition of the products within this revenue category has not changed from the previous periods disclosures.The following is a description of the notable comparable store sales changes in our International segment by revenue category:Consumer Electronics: The 6.9% comparable store sales decline was driven primarily by decreases in the sales of digital imaging products and televisions as a result of similar factors to those experienced within our Domestic segment.Computing and Mobile Phones: The flat comparable store sales resulted from decreased mobile phone sales in our small format stores in Europe, as well as declines in the sales of desktops and monitors, as consumer preference continued to shift toward mobile computing devices. These declines were fully offset by increased sales of mobile computing devices due to strong tablet sales and increased sales of mobile phones throughout the remainder of the stores in our International segment.Entertainment: The 13.3% comparable store sales decline resulted primarily from decreases in the sales of gaming in Canada due to overall market softness, similar to trends seen in our Domestic segment.Appliances: The 4.5% comparable store sales gain was primarily due to an increase in the sales of appliances in our Five Star operations, as consumers continued to take advantage of government stimulus programs before they effectively ended in December 2011. Broadly, the stimulus programs provided customers a subsidy or discount when purchasing a new energy efficient appliance and trading in their old appliance. Services: The 1.3% comparable store sales decline was due to a decrease in the sales of extended warranties and repair services, partially offset by an increase in the customer base in our mobile virtual network operator and fixed line services in Europe.Our International segment experienced gross profit growth in fiscal 2012 of $160 million, or 5.0%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased gross profit from our stores in Canada and our Five Star operations, partially offset by a gross profit decline in our small format stores in Europe. The 0.4% of revenue increase in the gross profit rate reflected the following factors:improved margin rates in Canada, especially in televisions and notebook computers; andan improved margin rate in Five Star as a result of improved cost programs with vendors;partially offset by higher sales in our Five Star business, which has a relatively lower gross profit rate; and a rate decrease in our small format stores in Europe due to market pressures.Our International segments SG&A increased $135 million, or 4.8%, in fiscal 2012, driven primarily by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, our International segments SG&A increased $41 million. The increase in SG&A spending and the 0.3% of revenue increase in the SG&A rate were both driven by a decrease in the Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee and other costs as a result of the strategic changes made at Best Buy Europe, and increased advertising costs and the deleveraging impact of negative comparable store sales in Canada. These increases were partially offset by lower overall spending in our small format stores in Europe and a decrease in support costs for our International segment due to previous restructuring activities. For further information on the strategic changes at Best Buy Europe, see Additional Consolidated Results, below. 44Table of ContentsOur International segment recorded $15 million and $107 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. The restructuring charges consisted of property and equipment impairments related to information technology ("IT") assets as a result of changes in our international expansion strategy. These restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2012 and 2011 of 0.1% of revenue and 0.9% of revenue, respectively.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a $1.2 billion goodwill impairment charge relating to our Best Buy Europe reporting unit, as a result of the Mobile buy out. The cash flows attributable to Best Buy Europe under the profit share agreement represented a significant proportion of the fair value attributable to the Best Buy Europe reporting unit. Accordingly, the Mobile buy out resulted in these cash flows no longer being available to the reporting unit. Upon completion of the Mobile buy out, we performed an impairment review of the associated goodwill and determined that the entire amount of $1.2 billion was impaired. Refer to Note 2, Profit Share Buy Out, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information about the goodwill impairment. The International segment experienced an operating loss in fiscal 2012, compared to operating income in fiscal 2011, primarily due to the write off of $1.2 billion of goodwill at our Best Buy Europe reporting unit, partially offset by improved operating income in Canada and lower ongoing support costs due to previous restructuring activities. The goodwill write off more than offset the increase in revenue and improvement in the gross profit rate in fiscal 2012. For further information on the Mobile buy out, see Additional Consolidated Results, below.Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010While challenging economic conditions persisted in fiscal 2011 in many of the countries in which we operate, our International segment continued to grow revenue and experienced a comparable store sales gain for the year. An increase in operating income was due principally to improvements within Europe and our Five Star operations, partially offset by impact of the restructuring activities in fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the International segment experienced a decrease in SG&A, while the gross profit rate remained consistent. Continued growth in consumer spending and temporary government stimulus programs contributed to stronger sales and improved operating income in our Five Star business. Our Canada operations faced many of the same market conditions and factors affecting the U.S. consumer electronics industry, with the adoption of new technology and the timing of product life cycles continuing to play an important role in revenue trends. Similarly, our Europe operations saw the impacts from a constrained economy, but continued to benefit from higher Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fees paid in fiscal 2011.The 4.7% increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was due to the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (mainly related to the Canadian dollar), a 2.3% comparable store sales gain and the impact of net new stores opened during fiscal 2011, partially offset by the impact of having one less week of revenue in Europe and a decline in sales in non comparable sales channels. The increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2011 was the result of gains in Five Star and Europe, partially offset by a decline in Canada.The components of the International segments 4.7% revenue increase in fiscal 2011 were as follows:Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations2.5 %Comparable store sales impact1.9 %Net new stores1.3 %One less week of revenue for Best Buy Europe(1)(0.6)%Non comparable sales channels(2)(0.4)%Total revenue increase4.7 %(1)Represents the incremental revenue associated with Best Buy Europe in fiscal 2010, which had 53 weeks of activity, compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011.(2)Non comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.The net addition of 18 large format stores throughout the International segment during the past 12 months (primarily Best Buy Canada, Future Shop and Five Star) contributed the majority of the change in revenue associated with net new stores, with Five Star stores having a lesser impact given the timing of their openings later in the year. Offsetting the revenue increase from large format stores was the impact of net closures of small format stores in Europe, which had a smaller impact on the overall revenue change given their smaller square footage compared to our large format stores.45Table of ContentsThe following table presents the International segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2011 and 2010: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February 26, 2011 February 27, 2010 February 26, 2011 February 27, 2010Consumer Electronics20% 20% (2.8)% (11.8)%Computing and Mobile Phones(1)55% 52% 4.9 % (0.7)%Entertainment6% 7% (12.4)% (12.4)%Appliances9% 9% 15.8 % 7.8 %Services10% 12% (1.6)% 6.2 %Other&lt;1% &lt;1% n/a n/aTotal100% 100% 2.3 % (3.6)%(1)During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the revenue category previously referred to as "Home Office" was renamed "Computing and Mobile Phones" to more clearly reflect the key products included within the revenue category. However, the composition of the products within this revenue category has not changed from the previous periods disclosures.The products having the largest impact on our International segments comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2011 were mobile phones, appliances and mobile computing. Increased sales in these product categories were partially offset by declines in the sales of entertainment hardware and software, including video gaming hardware and software, DVDs and CDs.The following is a description of the notable comparable store sales changes in our International segment by revenue category:Consumer Electronics: The 2.8% comparable store sales decline resulted primarily from declines in the sales of navigation products and MP3 players and accessories. Televisions remained essentially flat, as gains in the sales of televisions in Five Star, were offset by declines in Canada, which faced market conditions similar to the U.S. Computing and Mobile Phones: The 4.9% comparable store sales gain resulted primarily from gains in the sales of mobile phones and mobile computing, partially offset by declines in sales of desktop computers, monitors and accessories. Entertainment: The 12.4% comparable store sales decline reflected a decrease in the sales of video gaming hardware and software and continued decreases in sales of DVDs and CDs. Appliances: The 15.8% comparable store sales gain resulted primarily from increases in the sales of appliances within our Five Star operations, where growth in consumer spending and temporary government stimulus programs continued to contribute to stronger sales. Broadly, the stimulus programs provided customers a subsidy or discount when purchasing a new energy efficient appliance and trading in their old appliance. Services: The 1.6% comparable store sales decline was due primarily to a decrease in the sales of extended warranties driven by declines in the sales of televisions and notebook computers in Canada.Our International segment experienced gross profit growth in fiscal 2011 of $149 million, or 4.8%. The increase in gross profit in fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in revenue and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as the gross profit rate remained relatively flat. The 0.1% of revenue increase in the gross profit rate in fiscal 2011 reflects a favorable rate impact of 0.4% of revenue, partially offset by an unfavorable mix impact of 0.3% of revenue. The favorable rate impact was mainly the result of gains in Canada, with improved margins in all product categories, especially mobile computing and entertainment hardware and software. The unfavorable mix impact resulted primarily from a decrease in the mix of our higher margin Europe business and growth in our lower margin Five Star business.In fiscal 2011, our International segments SG&A remained essentially flat as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased spending associated with new store openings in our Canada and Five Star operations, were offset by a decrease in Europe due to the higher Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, our International segments SG&A decreased $56 million. The 0.9% of revenue improvement in the SG&A rate was driven primarily by a rate decline in Europe due to the higher Best Buy Mobile profit share based management fee, as well as the favorable mix impact from a decrease in the sales mix of our higher rate Europe business. These improvements were partially offset by a rate increase in Canada caused by the deleveraging impact of its comparable store sales decline and increased advertising costs to drive traffic.Our International segment recorded $107 million and $27 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 consisted of property and equipment impairments related to IT assets as a result of 46Table of Contentschanges in our international expansion strategy. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were related primarily to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs at Best Buy Europe. These restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2011 and 2010 of 0.9% of revenue and 0.2% of revenue, respectively.The increase in our International segments operating income in fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from higher operating income in Europe and from Five Star, partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges. Our International segments operating income in fiscal 2011 included $107 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter, compared to $27 million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. Additional Consolidated ResultsOther Income (Expense)In fiscal 2012, we sold our shares of common stock in TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC and Carphone Warehouse Group plc for $112 million. We recorded a pre tax gain of $55 million related to the sale.Our investment income and other in fiscal 2012 was $37 million, compared to $43 million and $53 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in investment income for both fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of lower returns on our deferred compensation assets. Interest expense in fiscal 2012 was $134 million, compared to $86 million and $92 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2012, compared to fiscal 2011, was primarily driven by our issuance of $1 billion of long term debt securities in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The relatively flat interest expense in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of lower average short term borrowings throughout fiscal 2011, partially offset by higher average interest rates on outstanding short term borrowings.Effective Income Tax RateOur effective income tax rate ("ETR") was 68.0% in fiscal 2012, compared to 33.4% in fiscal 2011. The increase in the ETR in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was mainly the result of the $1.2 billion goodwill impairment related to our Best Buy Europe reporting unit, as the goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The tax impacts of foreign operations and other discrete events had minimal impact on the year over year ETR. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment, the ETR would have been approximately 32.7%. Our ETR was 33.4% in fiscal 2011, compared to 35.9% in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the ETR in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to the impact of increased tax benefits from foreign operations, which in turn were due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings.Our consolidated effective tax rate is impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. As our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower statutory rates than the 35% U.S. statutory rate, changes in the proportion of our consolidated taxable earnings originating in foreign jurisdictions impact our consolidated effective rate. Our foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and are not subject to current U.S. income tax.Discontinued OperationsDiscontinued operations consists of our large format Best Buy branded stores in China, Turkey and the U.K., and The Phone House retail stores in Belgium in our International segment, as well as Napster and Speakeasy in our Domestic segment.The increase in loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of increased restructuring charges. Net loss from discontinued operations included $186 million (net of taxes) of restructuring charges in fiscal 2012 compared to $54 million (net of taxes) in fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2012 restructuring charges included inventory write downs, property and equipment impairments, facility closure costs, employee termination benefits and other costs primarily related to the closure of our 11 large format Best Buy branded stores in the U.K. The fiscal 2011 restructuring charges included inventory write downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits and facility closure costs as a result of our decision to exit the Turkey market and close our Best Buy branded stores in China.The increase in loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to increased restructuring charges and increased losses related to our large format Best Buy branded stores in the U.K. Net loss from discontinued operations included $54 million (net of taxes) of restructuring charges related to our decision to exit the Turkey market and close our Best Buy branded stores in China. We recorded no restructuring charges related to discontinued operations in fiscal 2010. 47Table of ContentsThe increase in net loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was the result of increased losses from our large format Best Buy branded stores in the U.K. due to restructuring activities undertaken to close the stores. The U.K. stores are part of Best Buy Europe, our consolidated subsidiary in which Carphone Warehouse Group plc ("Carphone Warehouse") holds a 50% noncontrolling interest. The increase in net loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of increased operating losses from our large format Best Buy branded stores in the U.K.Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsThe increase in net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was due to the strategic changes in respect of Best Buy Europe announced in November 2011. The strategic changes included the Mobile buy out, which was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The $1.3 billion payment related to the Mobile buy out was presented within the Net (earnings) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the payment to Carphone Warehouse is included within the Payment to noncontrolling interest line, as part of cash flows from financing activities. Refer to Note 2, Profit Share Buy Out, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information about the Mobile buy out.The increase in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to higher net earnings of Best Buy Europe. Impact of Inflation and Changing PricesHighly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products limited our ability to increase our gross profit rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSummaryWe continue to closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. The key variables we use to manage our liquidity requirements are the level of investment to support our growth strategies, discretionary SG&A spending, capital expenditures, credit facilities and short term borrowing arrangements, working capital management and our share repurchase program.Capital expenditures, particularly with respect to opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, is a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 remained relatively consistent with capital expenditures in fiscal 2011, and we expect this trend to continue in fiscal 2013. We plan to continue to invest in existing businesses and facilities, with a focus on profitable growth areas such as Best Buy Mobile and our Five Star operations in China, as well as modifying certain existing stores to our new pilot Connected Store format. We also plan to to continue upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities throughout fiscal 2013.We ended fiscal 2012 with $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, compared to $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2011. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to increased cash generated from operations and the issuance of $1.0 billion of long term debt securities in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, partially offset by the $1.5 billion of cash utilized in fiscal 2012 to repurchase shares of our common stock, as well as the $1.3 billion payment for the Mobile buy out. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $1.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2012, a decrease from $1.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2011. Operating cash flow increased $2.1 billion to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, while capital expenditures remained relatively consistent.48Table of ContentsCash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2012 2011 2010Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,293 $1,190 $2,206Investing activities(724) (569) (540)Financing activities(2,478) (1,357) (348)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash5 13 10Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$96 $(723) $1,328Operating ActivitiesThe increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily related to the normalization of accounts payable during fiscal 2012, following unusually low balances at the end of fiscal 2011 due to the timing of merchandise receipts in the fourth quarter, as well as efforts to reduce inventory levels throughout fiscal 2012, which were unusually high at the end of fiscal 2011.The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to an increase in cash used for accounts payable, as well as a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable. The increase in cash used for accounts payable was due primarily to the timing and level of inventory receipts compared to vendor payments as we approached fiscal 2011 year end. As we reduced inventory receipts in January and February 2011 in response to lower holiday sales trends, our total accounts payable declined. Cash used for inventory was also lower in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 because the fiscal 2011 year over year increase in inventory was lower than in the prior year due to focused efforts to manage inventory levels in light of comparable store sales declines. The decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable was due primarily to the timing of several large payments due from our vendors at the end of fiscal 2011. Other fluctuations in cash from operating activities were due primarily to higher incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2011 (relating to our fiscal 2010 performance) and other miscellaneous timing differences.Investing ActivitiesThe increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was mainly due to cash used for our acquisition of mindSHIFT Technologies, Inc. and decreased sales of auction rate securities ("ARS") in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Cash used in investing activities was relatively flat in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, as an increase in cash used for capital expenditures was offset by an increase in cash provided by the sale of a portion of our ARS during fiscal 2011. See Auction Rate Securities and Restricted Cash and Capital Expenditures below for additional information.Financing ActivitiesThe increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of $1.3 billion of cash we used for the Mobile buy out, an increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock and the repurchase of convertible debentures during fiscal 2012, partially offset by the issuance of $1.0 billion of long term debt securities in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.The increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of $1.2 billion of cash we used to repurchase our common stock in fiscal 2011. We had no repurchases in fiscal 2010.Sources of LiquidityFunds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations and to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives in fiscal 2013. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending on future expansion plans, share repurchases or other business opportunities. There can be no 49Table of Contentsassurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.We have a $1.0 billion 364 Day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "364 Day Facility Agreement") and a $1.5 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Five Year Facility Agreement" and, collectively the "Agreements") with a syndicate of banks, with no borrowings outstanding on the Agreements at March 3, 2012. The 364 Day Facility Agreement expires in October 2012 (subject to a one year term out option) and the Five Year Facility Agreement expires in October 2016. At April 26, 2012, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Agreements.We have $794 million available (based on the exchange rate in effect as of the end of fiscal 2012) under unsecured revolving credit facilities related to our International segment operations, of which $480 million was outstanding at March 3, 2012. Refer to Note 8, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information about our credit facilities.Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of our facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At March 3, 2012, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. If an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under our credit facilities as well.An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in Exhibit No. 12.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, was 3.14 and 6.51 in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.Our credit ratings and outlooks at April 26, 2012, are summarized below. In June 2011, Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch") lowered our rating from BBB+ with a negative outlook to BBB with a stable outlook. In April 2012, Fitch reaffirmed our BBB rating but lowered their outlook to negative, citing comparable store sales pressures and competition in the consumer electronics industry. These changes had no material impact on our current borrowing costs, and we believe they will not have a material impact on our ability to raise further debt financing in the future or the prospective borrowing costs associated with such debt. The ratings and outlooks issued by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys") and Standard & Poors Rating Services ("Standard & Poors") are consistent with the ratings and outlooks reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2011.Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB NegativeMoodysBaa2 StableStandard & PoorsBBB StableCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. If further changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new store leasing costs. Auction Rate Securities and Restricted CashAt March 3, 2012, and February 26, 2011, we had $82 million and $110 million, respectively, invested in ARS recorded at fair value within Equity and other investments (long term) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The majority of our ARS portfolio is AAA/Aaa rated and collateralized by student loans, which are guaranteed 95% to 100% by the U.S. government. Due to the auction failures that began in February 2008, we have been unable to liquidate some of our ARS. The investment principal associated with our ARS subject to failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, or final payments are due according to the contractual maturities of the debt issues, which range from four to 30 years. We do not intend to sell our remaining ARS until we can recover the full principal amount through one of the means described above. In addition, we do not believe it is more likely than not we would be required to sell our remaining ARS until we can recover the full principal amount based on our other sources of liquidity.50Table of ContentsOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and customer warranty and insurance programs. Restricted cash and cash equivalents, which are included in other current assets, were $459 million and $488 million at March 3, 2012, and February 26, 2011, respectively.Capital ExpendituresOur capital expenditures typically include investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2012, we invested $766 million in property and equipment, including opening over 300 new stores, remodeling certain stores (primarily store merchandising projects), and upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities. The following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2012 2011 2010New stores$171 $193 $229Store related projects(1)231 208 90Information technology353 327 275Other11 16 21Total capital expenditures(2)$766 $744 $615(1)Includes store remodels and expansions, as well as various merchandising projects.(2)Total capital expenditures exclude non cash capital expenditures of $18, $81 and $9 for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Non cash capital expenditures are comprised of capitalized leases, as well as additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable.Refer to Note 15, Contingencies and Commitments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our significant commitments for capital expenditures at March 3, 2012.Debt and Capital2013 NotesIn June 2008, we sold $500 million principal amount of notes due July 15, 2013 (the "2013 Notes"). The 2013 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per year, payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2009. The interest payable on the 2013 Notes is subject to adjustment if either Moodys or Standard & Poors downgrades the rating assigned to the 2013 Notes to below investment grade. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2013 Notes were $496 million, after an initial issuance discount of $1 million and other transaction costs.We may redeem some or all of the 2013 Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and an applicable make whole amount as described in the indenture relating to the 2013 Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. The 2013 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2013 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens, enter into sale and lease back transactions and, in the case of such subsidiaries, incur unsecured debt.2016 and 2021 Notes In March 2011, we issued $350 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) and $650 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (the 2021 Notes and, together with the 2016 Notes, the Notes). The 2016 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% per year, while the 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2011. The Notes were issued at a slight discount to par, which when coupled with underwriting discounts of $6 million, resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $990 million. 51Table of ContentsWe may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest on the Notes redeemed discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes to the redemption date as described in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and lease back transactions.OtherAt the end of fiscal 2012, we had $149 million outstanding under financing lease obligations.Share Repurchases and DividendsFrom time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity based incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital structure.In June 2011, our Board authorized a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program. The June 2011 program terminated and replaced our prior $5.5 billion share repurchase program authorized in June 2007. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the June 2011 program.In fiscal 2012, we repurchased and retired 54.6 million shares at a cost of $1.5 billion. We repurchased and retired 32.6 million shares at a cost of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011. We made no share repurchases in fiscal 2010. At the end of fiscal 2012, $4.1 billion of the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2011 was available for future share repurchases. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares.We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of funding, our future business plans and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, will be the main sources of funding for our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved by our Board under the June 2011 share repurchase program, we do not expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity.In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 8% to $0.14 per share, and maintained our cash dividend at that rate for the balance of fiscal 2009 and throughout fiscal 2010. We increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $0.15 per share effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $0.16 per share. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2012, we made four cash dividend payments totaling $0.62 per share, or $228 million in the aggregate.Other Financial MeasuresOur debt to earnings ratio was 6.7 at the end of fiscal 2012, compared to 1.1 at the end of fiscal 2011, due primarily to the $1.2 billion goodwill impairment in fiscal 2012. Our adjusted debt to earnings before goodwill impairment, interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent ("EBITDAR") ratio, which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation, was 2.6 and 2.3 at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, due primarily to an increase in debt and operating lease obligations in fiscal 2012.Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is considered a non GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the most directly comparable ratio determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). We have included this information in our MD&A as we view the adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Furthermore, we believe that our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is 52Table of Contentsimportant for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth. We also believe our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to that of retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owners desire to own or to lease the location, and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders.Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is calculated as follows: Adjusted debtAdjusted debt to EBITDAR EBITDARThe most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio, which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation.The following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio ($ in millions): 2012(1) 2011(1)Debt (including current portion)$2,208 $1,709Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense)(2)9,402 8,992Adjusted debt$11,610 $10,701 Net earnings from continuing operations including noncontrolling interests(3)$330 $1,554Goodwill impairment1,207 Interest expense, net97 43Income tax expense709 779Depreciation and amortization expense(4)968 1,078Rental expense1,175 1,124EBITDAR$4,486 $4,578 Debt to net earnings ratio6.7 1.1Adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio2.6 2.3(1)Debt is reflected as of the balance sheet dates for each of the respective fiscal year ends, while rental expense and the other components of EBITDAR represent activity for the 12 months ended as of each of the respective balance sheet dates.(2)The multiple of eight times annual rental expense in the calculation of our capitalized operating lease obligations is the multiple used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness, and we consider it to be an appropriate multiple for our lease portfolio.(3)We utilize net earnings including noncontrolling interests within our calculation as such net earnings and related cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests are available to service our debt and operating lease commitments.(4)Depreciation and amortization expense includes impairments of fixed assets, investments and intangible assets (including impairments associated with our fiscal restructuring activities).Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsOther than operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the "Contractual Obligations" table below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item 2, Properties, and Note 11, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.53Table of ContentsThe following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than5 YearsShort term debt obligations$480 $480 $ $ $Long term debt obligations1,498 500 349 649Capital lease obligations81 18 35 11 17Financing lease obligations149 22 47 40 40Interest payments500 101 142 105 152Operating lease obligations(1)7,517 1,216 2,217 1,732 2,352Purchase obligations(2)3,548 1,771 1,499 278 Unrecognized tax benefits(3)387 Deferred compensation(4)62 Total$14,222 $3,608 $4,440 $2,515 $3,210Note: For additional information refer to Note 8, Debt; Note 11, Leases; Note 13, Income Taxes and Note 15, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.(1)Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $2.1 billion at March 3, 2012.(2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.(3)Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting guidance that we adopted on March 4, 2007. As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table.(4)Included in Long term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 3, 2012, was a $62 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table.Additionally, we have $2.8 billion in undrawn capacity on our credit facilities at March 3, 2012, which if drawn upon, would be included as short term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.54Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board.Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss adjustments. Our inventory valuation reflects markdowns for the excess of the cost over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis. Our inventory valuation also reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. Our markdown adjustment contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecast consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. Our inventory loss adjustment contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our markdown or inventory loss adjustments during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdowns. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdowns at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2012. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss adjustment. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory loss adjustments at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million in fiscal 2012. Vendor Allowances We receive funds from vendors for various programs, primarily as reimbursements for costs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and sales incentives. Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All other vendor allowances are generally in the form of receipt based funds or sell through credits. Receipt based funds are generally determined based on our level of inventory purchases and initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Sell through credits are generally based on the number of units we sell over a specified period and are recognized when the related product is sold. Based on the provisions of our vendor agreements, we develop vendor fund accrual rates by estimating the point at which we will have completed our performance under the agreement and the deferred amounts will be earned. During the year, due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical trends to ensure the deferred amounts earned are appropriately recorded. As a part of these analyses, we apply rates negotiated with our vendors to actual purchase volumes to determine the amount of funds accrued and receivable from the vendor. Certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to record different forms of vendor allowances or vendor receivables during the past three fiscal years. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially, either positively or negatively, impact our gross profit rate and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal year and all amounts deferred against inventory turnover within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require subjective long term estimates. Adjustments to our gross profit rate and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material. A 10% difference in our vendor receivables at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $25 million in fiscal 2012.55Table of ContentsDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Long Lived Assets Long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. When reviewing long lived assets for impairment, we group long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses, except in relation to the store closures and other strategic changes announced in March 2012 (See Note 17, Subsequent Event, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment. Our impairment evaluation involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value. We carry forward the detailed determination of the fair value of a reporting unit in our annual goodwill impairment analysis if three criteria are met: (1) the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination; (2) the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin; and (3) based on an analysis of events that have occurred since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote. For all other reporting units, we perform a detailed determination of fair value of the reporting unit. Our detailed impairment analysis involves the use of a discounted cash flow model. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. Critical assumptions include projected comparable store sales growth, store count, gross profit rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures and terminal growth rates, as well as an appropriate discount rate. We determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the capital asset pricing model. We also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our companys market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as our future expectations. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets during the past three fiscal years. The carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at March 3, 2012, were $1.3 billion and $130 million, respectively. In fiscal 2012, we recorded a $1.2 billion goodwill impairment attributable to our Best Buy Europe reporting unit, representing full impairment of the reporting units goodwill. For the remainder of our goodwill outside the Best Buy Europe reporting unit, we determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units was substantial. As part of our recent restructuring activities, we recorded impairment charges of $3 million and $10 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to certain indefinite lived tradenames in our Domestic segment. These impairments were recorded within Loss from discontinued operations within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the respective years.We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.56Table of ContentsDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. Revenue Recognition See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for amounts due from third parties that we do not expect to collect. We estimate the allowance based on historical write offs and chargebacks as well as aging trends. We sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores, through our Web sites and through selected third parties. A liability is initially established for the cash value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage). We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which show that after 24 months, we can determine the portion of the liability for which redemption is remote. We have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed at any of our Best Buy branded stores, or through our related Web sites or when using our co branded credit cards in the U.S. and Canada. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at Best Buy branded stores and Web sites. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed. Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the amount and timing of future sales returns, uncollectible accounts and redemptions of gift cards and certificates. Our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns, uncollectible accounts and redemptions of gift cards and certificates is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to measure sales returns or doubtful accounts or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to measure sales returns and doubtful accounts or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales return reserve at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1 million in fiscal 2012. A 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2012. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million in fiscal 2012. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program liability at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2012.57Table of ContentsDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Costs Associated With Exit Activities When necessary, we vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations with remaining lease commitments, we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a risk free interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. The liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our location closing liability at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $9 million in fiscal 2012. Stock Based Compensation We have a stock based compensation plan, which includes non qualified stock options and nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 10, Shareholders Equity, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs. We determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option pricing models. Non qualified stock option awards are primarily valued using a lattice model. We determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Performance based nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2012. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general liability claims, as well as customer warranty and insurance programs, although we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. We maintain wholly owned insurance captives to manage a portion of these self insured liabilities. When estimating our self insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries. Periodically, we review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities. Our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at March 3, 2012, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2012.58Table of ContentsDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have an impact on our net earnings.See Note 4, Acquisitions, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for the acquisition related information associated with significant acquisitions completed in the last three fiscal years.New Accounting StandardsGoodwill Impairment In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance simplifying how to test goodwill for impairment. Under the new guidance, entities may make a qualitative assessment of the likelihood of goodwill impairment in order to determine whether a detailed quantitative analysis is required. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. As such, we will adopt the new guidance in our fiscal quarter ending May 5, 2012. We do not believe our adoption of the new guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Specifically, the new guidance requires an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. As such, we will adopt the new guidance in our fiscal quarter ending May 5, 2012. Fair Value Measurement In April 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. As such, we will adopt the new guidance in our fiscal quarter ending May 5, 2012. We do not believe our adoption of the new guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.59Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a limited basis, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our Canada, Europe and China businesses enter into the contracts primarily to hedge certain non functional currency transaction exposures.The aggregate notional amount related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at March 3, 2012, and February 26, 2011, was $238 million and $757 million, respectively. The fair value recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at March 3, 2012, and February 26, 2011, was $(1) million and $(1) million, respectively. The amount recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings related to all contracts settled and outstanding was a gain of $11 million in fiscal 2012, and a gain of $24 million in fiscal 2011.The overall weakness of the U.S. dollar compared to the U.K. pound, Canadian dollar, and Chinese Renminbi since the end of fiscal 2011 has had a positive overall impact on our revenue and net earnings as the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. It is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, the effect on reported revenue and net earnings can be estimated. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net favorable impact on our revenue and net earnings in fiscal 2012 of approximately $456 million and $2 million, respectively. Similarly, we estimate that the overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on our revenue and net earnings in fiscal 2011 of approximately $302 million and $7 million, respectively.Interest Rate RiskShort and long term debtAt March 3, 2012, our short and long term debt was comprised primarily of credit facilities, our 2013 Notes, our 2016 Notes and our 2021 Notes. We currently do not manage the interest rate risk on our debt through the use of derivative instruments.Our credit facilities interest rates may be reset due to fluctuations in a market based index, such as the federal funds rate, LIBOR, or the base rate or prime rate of our lenders. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates on the outstanding balance of our credit facilities at March 3, 2012, and February 26, 2011, would change our annual pre tax earnings by $5 million and $6 million, respectively.There is no interest rate risk associated with our 2013 Notes, our 2016 Notes or 2021 Notes, as the interest rates are fixed at 6.75%, 3.75% and 5.5%, respectively, per annum.Long term investments in debt securitiesAt March 3, 2012, our long term investments in debt securities were comprised of ARS. These investments are not subject to material interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate on such investments at March 3, 2012, and February 26, 2011, would change our annual pre tax earnings by $1 million and $1 million, respectively. We do not manage interest rate risk on our investments in debt securities through the use of derivative instruments.Other Market RisksInvestments in auction rate securitiesAt March 3, 2012, we held $82 million in investments in ARS, which includes a $6 million pre tax temporary impairment, compared to $110 million in investments in ARS and a $5 million pre tax temporary impairment at February 26, 2011. Given current conditions in the ARS market as described above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we may incur additional temporary unrealized losses or other than temporary realized losses in the future if market conditions were to persist and we were unable to recover the cost of our ARS investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point loss from the par value of these investments at March 3, 2012, and February 26, 2011, would result in an impairment of $1 million and $1 million, respectively.60Table of Contents
