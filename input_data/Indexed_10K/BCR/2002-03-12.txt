Bard is committed to developing leadership franchises within these disease states and using these strategic positions to leverage the companys growth. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Summary Results Bard reported 2001 net sales of $1,181.3 million, up 8% over 2000 net sales of $1,098.8 million. Holding currency rates constant, Bard would have recorded a 9% increase in total net sales over the prior year period. The company demonstrated growth in each of its four product groups: vascular, urology, oncology and surgery. Bard reported net income of $143.2 million or $2.75 of diluted earnings per share in 2001 compared with net income of $106.9 million or $2.09 of diluted earnings per share in 2000. 2000s earnings included one time items. Without these one time items, diluted earnings per share were $2.45 in 2000. Net of one time items, Bards margin of net income to net sales improved to 12.1% in 2001 from 11.4% in 2000. Results of Operations 2001 vs. 2000 Net sales for 2001 totaled $1,181.3 million, which represented an 8% increase over the prior year net sales of $1,098.8 million. Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 2001 net sales by 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Excluding negative currency effects, total net sales would have increased 9% in 2001 and 8% in 2000. Due to these negative currency effects, certain comparisons between 2001 and 2000, where indicated, are made holding currency rates constant. Sales of vascular products increased 4% in 2001 to $250.9 million. On a constant currency basis, these sales increased 6% over the prior year. The electrophysiology franchise continued to show good worldwide growth. Urology product group sales increased 8% in 2001 to $390.1 million and increased 9% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Both the infection control Foley catheter and brachytheraphy products demonstrated solid sales growth. Sales of oncology products increased 9% in 2001 to $274.6 million. The companys EndoCinchTM endoscopic suturing system, which isa device used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and bronchoscopy products continue to grow. Gastroenterological products showed particularly strong growth internationally. Sales of surgery products grew 12% in 2001 to $205.2 million, led by the mesh product lines, used primarily in hernia repair. On a constant currency basis, these sales increased 13% over the prior year. Other product sales of $60.5 million in 2001 remained comparable to prior years net sales on a constant currency basis. This product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain OEM products. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Net sales by product group for the last three years (in thousands) are: 2001 2000 1999 Vascular $250,900 $241,200 $226,200 Urology 390,100 361,200 353,600 Oncology 274,600 253,000 238,000 Surgery 205,200 182,600 164,500 Other products 60,500 60,800 54,200 Total net sales $1,181,300 $1,098,800 $1,036,500 Sales in the U.S. rose 9% to $862.5 million and represented 73% of total net sales. Surgery products provided the best growth domestically. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3% to $318.8 million and represented 27% of net sales. Oncology products demonstrated the best growth internationally. For the year, excluding negative currency effects, net sales outside the U.S. would have increased 7%. Bard markets its products through direct selling organizations and selected distributors throughout the world. The geographic breakdown, in percent, of net sales for each of the last three years is presented below: 2001 2000 1999 United States 73% 72% 71% Europe 17% 17% 19% Japan 5% 5% 5% Rest of World 5% 6% 5% Total net sales 100% 100% 100% Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales increased to 46.6% in 2001 from 45.4% in 2000. Product mix and the impact of currency contributed to this increase. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) As a percent of sales, marketing, selling and administrative expense was 30.8%, compared with the prior year figure of 321.09%. Research and development expense of $53.4 million in 2001 remained flat with the prior year and was complemented by $44.7 million of spending for acquired technologies. Interest expense was $14.2 million in 2001 compared to $19.3 million in 2000, reflecting lower interest rate and debt levels. Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of items in this category for the last three years. In 2000, the company announced that it would not exercise its option to acquire the remaining capital stock of Endologix, Inc., a California based company that had developed an endoluminal graft (ELG) used for the minimally invasive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. As a result, other (income) expense, net included a pretax charge of $40.3 million ($0.53 per share after tax) for the write off of the Endologix option and related assets and liabilities. The company recorded one time gains in 2000, 1999 and 1998 related to the series of dispositions of its cardiology product lines. In the first quarter of 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to these dispositions and recorded a gain of $15.4 million ($0.19 per share after tax). Please refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure. The effective tax rate was 30.1% in 2001 and 30.6% in 2000. Net Income In 2001, Bard reported net income of $143.2 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.75. The results for 2001 did not include any one time items. In 2000, Bard reported net income of $106.9 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.09. Foreign exchange and the companys dialysis catheter recall negatively impacted 2000 results by approximately $0.11 and $0.09 per share, respectively. The company recorded several one time items during 2000. Excluding the after tax charge relating to the companys decision not to exercise the Endologix option ($0.53 per share after tax), and the net after tax gain associated with other one time items, primarily asset dispositions and legal settlements ($0.17 per share after tax), diluted earnings per share was $2.45. In January 2001, Bard announced a major initiative designed to provide operating savings to fund incremental investment in research and development. This project was temporarily halted while the company pursued its merger with Tyco. The company has recently begun to reassess the various components of this project. It is likely that the company will resume certain aspects of this initiative during 2002. Please refer to the companys statement on forward looking information on page II 11. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Results of Operations 2000 vs. 1999 Net sales for 2000 totaled $1,098.8 million, which represented a 6% increase over the prior year net sales of ongoing products of $1,036.5 million. Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 2000 reported net sales by 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Sales of vascular products rose 7% in 2000. The peripheral technology and electrophysiology franchises continued to show strong worldwide growth. Urology product sales grew 2% in 2000. Both the infection control Foley catheter and brachytheraphy products demonstrated solid sales growth. Sales of oncology products increased 6% in 2000. Both the EndoCinch endoscopic suturing system and bronchoscopy products were introduced in 2000. Specialty access devices also showed good growth. Sales of surgery products grew 11% in 2000, propelled by high worldwide growth of mesh products, used primarily for hernia repair. Net sales in the U.S. of ongoing products rose 8% in 2000 to $788.3 million as compared to 1999. Surgery products provided the best growth domestically. Net sales of ongoing products outside the U.S. increased 2% to $310.5 million with oncology products demonstrating the best growth internationally. Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales increased to 45.4% in 2000 from 44.6% in 1999. Pricing pressures, the impact of currency, product recalls and lower margin OEM business all contributed to this increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expense in 2000 was 32%, essentially flat as compared with the prior year figure of 31.9% in 1999. Research and development expense remained consistent with the prior year at $53.2 million and was complemented by $68.6 million of spending for acquired technologies. Interest expense was $19.3 million in 2000, also consistent with the prior year. Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of items in this category for the last three years. In 2000, the company announced that it would not exercise its option to acquire the remaining capital stock of Endologix, Inc., a California based company that had developed an endoluminal graft (ELG) used for the minimally invasive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. As a result, the company recorded a pretax charge of $40.3 million ($0.53 per share after tax) for the write off of the Endologix option and related assets and liabilities. Other (income) expense, net, in 1999 included a pretax charge of $8.4 million for the write down of impaired assets. The company recorded one time gains in 2000, 1999 and 1998 related to the series of dispositions of its cardiology product lines. In the first quarter of 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to these dispositions and recorded a gain of $15.4 million ($0.19 per sha re after tax). Please refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure. The effective tax rate was 30.6% in 2000 and 31.9% in 1999. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Net Income In 2000, Bard reported net income of $106.9 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.09. Foreign exchange and the companys dialysis catheter recall negatively impacted 2000 results by approximately $0.11 and $0.09 per share, respectively. The company recorded several one time items during 2000. Excluding the after tax charge relating to the companys decision not to exercise the Endologix option ($0.53 per share after tax), and the net after tax gain associated with other one time items, primarily asset dispositions and legal settlements ($0.17 per share after tax), diluted earnings per share was $2.45. In 1999, Bard reported net income of $118.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.28. Excluding the impact of the after tax gain on the sale of the cardiopulmonary business of $0.12 per share and the after tax loss associated with the fourth quarter write down of impaired assets of $0.11 per share, diluted earnings per share was $2.27. Financial Condition and Liquidity Bards financial condition remains strong. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. This decrease was the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 16.6% at December 31, 2001, compared to 25.0% at December 31, 2000. In addition, Bard increased its cash and marketable securities position to $271 million at December 31, 2001 from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. , while net debt, or debt less cash and short term investments, to total capitalization was 13.4% at December 31, 2001, compared to 12.2% at December 31, 2000. Shareholders investment was impacted in 2001 by the repurchase of $17.5 million of common stock. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300 million committed credit facility with a $200 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May 2005 and a $100 million 364 day committed credit facility that matures in May 2002. These facilities support an actively used commercial paper program. These facilities carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. At December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings under these facilities. Bard maintains uncommitted credit lines with banks for short term cash needs and these lines were used as needed during the last three years. At December 31, 2001, the unused uncommitted lines of credit totaled $5075.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings against uncommitted lines at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Cash provided from operations continued to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. The company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights, and other related items were approximately $45 million in 2001, $69 million in 2000 and $48 million in 1999. The majority of these investments were for intangible assets, reflecting the premium over book value for these purchases. These cash outlays were financed with cash from operations and additional debt. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market to provide shares for issuance under various employee stock plans. In connection with the announced sale of the cardiology businesses, the Board of Directors in July of 1998 authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 10 million shares of common stock. Total shares purchased were 401,500 in 2001, 420,300 in 2000, and 1,629,600 in 1999. 1,853,400 shares remain under the 10 million share purchase authorization. The company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts and options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. These contracts, which have not been significant, have been exclusively for the forward purchase of, and options in, currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values. On January 1, 1999, the eleven original member countries of the European Union began the transition to a common currency, the Euro. These participating countries expect the Euro transition to be completed by July 2002. The company has addressed potential Euro related issues including pricing/marketing strategy, conversion of computer systems, existing contracts and currency risk in the participating countries. At the present time, management does not believe the Euro conversion has had or will have a material impact on the companys business.

In addition, Bard increased its cash and marketable securities position to $271 million at December 31, 2001 from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. , while net debt, or debt less cash and short term investments, to total capitalization was 13.4% at December 31, 2001, compared to 12.2% at December 31, 2000. Shareholders investment was impacted in 2001 by the repurchase of $17.5 million of common stock. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300 million committed credit facility with a $200 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May 2005 and a $100 million 364 day committed credit facility that matures in May 2002. These facilities support an actively used commercial paper program. These facilities carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. At December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings under these facilities. Bard maintains uncommitted credit lines with banks for short term cash needs and these lines were used as needed during the last three years. At December 31, 2001, the unused uncommitted lines of credit totaled $5075.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings against uncommitted lines at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Cash provided from operations continued to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. The company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights, and other related items were approximately $45 million in 2001, $69 million in 2000 and $48 million in 1999. The majority of these investments were for intangible assets, reflecting the premium over book value for these purchases. These cash outlays were financed with cash from operations and additional debt. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market to provide shares for issuance under various employee stock plans. In connection with the announced sale of the cardiology businesses, the Board of Directors in July of 1998 authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 10 million shares of common stock. Total shares purchased were 401,500 in 2001, 420,300 in 2000, and 1,629,600 in 1999. 1,853,400 shares remain under the 10 million share purchase authorization. The company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts and options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. These contracts, which have not been significant, have been exclusively for the forward purchase of, and options in, currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values. On January 1, 1999, the eleven original member countries of the European Union began the transition to a common currency, the Euro. These participating countries expect the Euro transition to be completed by July 2002. The company has addressed potential Euro related issues including pricing/marketing strategy, conversion of computer systems, existing contracts and currency risk in the participating countries. At the present time, management does not believe the Euro conversion has had or will have a material impact on the companys business. Use of Estimates and Cautionary Factors That May Effect Future Results The consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for rebates, returns and allowances, depreciable/amortizable lives, pension assumptions, inventory realization and amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities and other reserves. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. The company is not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being recorded that would have a material impact on results of operations or financial condition. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid systems or other U.S. or non U.S. reimbursement systems in a manner that would sig nificantly reduce reimbursements for procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respec t to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumstances change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on relate d subjects in our 10 Q, 8 K and 10 K reports. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Net sales by product group for the last three years (in thousands) are: 2001 2000 1999 Vascular $250,900 $241,200 $226,200 Urology 390,100 361,200 353,600 Oncology 274,600 253,000 238,000 Surgery 205,200 182,600 164,500 Other products 60,500 60,800 54,200 Total net sales $1,181,300 $1,098,800 $1,036,500 Sales in the U.S. rose 9% to $862.5 million and represented 73% of total net sales. Surgery products provided the best growth domestically. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3% to $318.8 million and represented 27% of net sales. Oncology products demonstrated the best growth internationally. For the year, excluding negative currency effects, net sales outside the U.S. would have increased 7%. Bard markets its products through direct selling organizations and selected distributors throughout the world. The geographic breakdown, in percent, of net sales for each of the last three years is presented below: 2001 2000 1999 United States 73% 72% 71% Europe 17% 17% 19% Japan 5% 5% 5% Rest of World 5% 6% 5% Total net sales 100% 100% 100% Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales increased to 46.6% in 2001 from 45.4% in 2000. Product mix and the impact of currency contributed to this increase. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) As a percent of sales, marketing, selling and administrative expense was 30.8%, compared with the prior year figure of 321.09%. Research and development expense of $53.4 million in 2001 remained flat with the prior year and was complemented by $44.7 million of spending for acquired technologies. Interest expense was $14.2 million in 2001 compared to $19.3 million in 2000, reflecting lower interest rate and debt levels. Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of items in this category for the last three years. In 2000, the company announced that it would not exercise its option to acquire the remaining capital stock of Endologix, Inc., a California based company that had developed an endoluminal graft (ELG) used for the minimally invasive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. As a result, other (income) expense, net included a pretax charge of $40.3 million ($0.53 per share after tax) for the write off of the Endologix option and related assets and liabilities. The company recorded one time gains in 2000, 1999 and 1998 related to the series of dispositions of its cardiology product lines. In the first quarter of 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to these dispositions and recorded a gain of $15.4 million ($0.19 per share after tax). Please refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure. The effective tax rate was 30.1% in 2001 and 30.6% in 2000. Net Income In 2001, Bard reported net income of $143.2 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.75. The results for 2001 did not include any one time items. In 2000, Bard reported net income of $106.9 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.09. Foreign exchange and the companys dialysis catheter recall negatively impacted 2000 results by approximately $0.11 and $0.09 per share, respectively. The company recorded several one time items during 2000. Excluding the after tax charge relating to the companys decision not to exercise the Endologix option ($0.53 per share after tax), and the net after tax gain associated with other one time items, primarily asset dispositions and legal settlements ($0.17 per share after tax), diluted earnings per share was $2.45. In January 2001, Bard announced a major initiative designed to provide operating savings to fund incremental investment in research and development. This project was temporarily halted while the company pursued its merger with Tyco. The company has recently begun to reassess the various components of this project. It is likely that the company will resume certain aspects of this initiative during 2002. Please refer to the companys statement on forward looking information on page II 11. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Results of Operations 2000 vs. 1999 Net sales for 2000 totaled $1,098.8 million, which represented a 6% increase over the prior year net sales of ongoing products of $1,036.5 million. Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 2000 reported net sales by 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Sales of vascular products rose 7% in 2000. The peripheral technology and electrophysiology franchises continued to show strong worldwide growth. Urology product sales grew 2% in 2000. Both the infection control Foley catheter and brachytheraphy products demonstrated solid sales growth. Sales of oncology products increased 6% in 2000. Both the EndoCinch endoscopic suturing system and bronchoscopy products were introduced in 2000. Specialty access devices also showed good growth. Sales of surgery products grew 11% in 2000, propelled by high worldwide growth of mesh products, used primarily for hernia repair. Net sales in the U.S. of ongoing products rose 8% in 2000 to $788.3 million as compared to 1999. Surgery products provided the best growth domestically. Net sales of ongoing products outside the U.S. increased 2% to $310.5 million with oncology products demonstrating the best growth internationally. Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales increased to 45.4% in 2000 from 44.6% in 1999. Pricing pressures, the impact of currency, product recalls and lower margin OEM business all contributed to this increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expense in 2000 was 32%, essentially flat as compared with the prior year figure of 31.9% in 1999. Research and development expense remained consistent with the prior year at $53.2 million and was complemented by $68.6 million of spending for acquired technologies.

At December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings under these facilities. Bard maintains uncommitted credit lines with banks for short term cash needs and these lines were used as needed during the last three years. At December 31, 2001, the unused uncommitted lines of credit totaled $5075.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings against uncommitted lines at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Cash provided from operations continued to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. The company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights, and other related items were approximately $45 million in 2001, $69 million in 2000 and $48 million in 1999. The majority of these investments were for intangible assets, reflecting the premium over book value for these purchases. These cash outlays were financed with cash from operations and additional debt. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market to provide shares for issuance under various employee stock plans. In connection with the announced sale of the cardiology businesses, the Board of Directors in July of 1998 authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 10 million shares of common stock. Total shares purchased were 401,500 in 2001, 420,300 in 2000, and 1,629,600 in 1999. 1,853,400 shares remain under the 10 million share purchase authorization. The company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts and options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. These contracts, which have not been significant, have been exclusively for the forward purchase of, and options in, currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values. On January 1, 1999, the eleven original member countries of the European Union began the transition to a common currency, the Euro. These participating countries expect the Euro transition to be completed by July 2002. The company has addressed potential Euro related issues including pricing/marketing strategy, conversion of computer systems, existing contracts and currency risk in the participating countries. At the present time, management does not believe the Euro conversion has had or will have a material impact on the companys business. Use of Estimates and Cautionary Factors That May Effect Future Results The consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for rebates, returns and allowances, depreciable/amortizable lives, pension assumptions, inventory realization and amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities and other reserves. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. The company is not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being recorded that would have a material impact on results of operations or financial condition. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid systems or other U.S. or non U.S. reimbursement systems in a manner that would sig nificantly reduce reimbursements for procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respec t to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumstances change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on relate d subjects in our 10 Q, 8 K and 10 K reports. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Results of Operations 2000 vs. 1999 Net sales for 2000 totaled $1,098.8 million, which represented a 6% increase over the prior year net sales of ongoing products of $1,036.5 million. Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 2000 reported net sales by 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Sales of vascular products rose 7% in 2000. The peripheral technology and electrophysiology franchises continued to show strong worldwide growth. Urology product sales grew 2% in 2000. Both the infection control Foley catheter and brachytheraphy products demonstrated solid sales growth. Sales of oncology products increased 6% in 2000. Both the EndoCinch endoscopic suturing system and bronchoscopy products were introduced in 2000. Specialty access devices also showed good growth. Sales of surgery products grew 11% in 2000, propelled by high worldwide growth of mesh products, used primarily for hernia repair. Net sales in the U.S. of ongoing products rose 8% in 2000 to $788.3 million as compared to 1999. Surgery products provided the best growth domestically. Net sales of ongoing products outside the U.S. increased 2% to $310.5 million with oncology products demonstrating the best growth internationally. Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales increased to 45.4% in 2000 from 44.6% in 1999. Pricing pressures, the impact of currency, product recalls and lower margin OEM business all contributed to this increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expense in 2000 was 32%, essentially flat as compared with the prior year figure of 31.9% in 1999. Research and development expense remained consistent with the prior year at $53.2 million and was complemented by $68.6 million of spending for acquired technologies. Interest expense was $19.3 million in 2000, also consistent with the prior year. Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of items in this category for the last three years. In 2000, the company announced that it would not exercise its option to acquire the remaining capital stock of Endologix, Inc., a California based company that had developed an endoluminal graft (ELG) used for the minimally invasive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. As a result, the company recorded a pretax charge of $40.3 million ($0.53 per share after tax) for the write off of the Endologix option and related assets and liabilities. Other (income) expense, net, in 1999 included a pretax charge of $8.4 million for the write down of impaired assets. The company recorded one time gains in 2000, 1999 and 1998 related to the series of dispositions of its cardiology product lines. In the first quarter of 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to these dispositions and recorded a gain of $15.4 million ($0.19 per sha re after tax). Please refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure. The effective tax rate was 30.6% in 2000 and 31.9% in 1999. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Net Income In 2000, Bard reported net income of $106.9 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.09. Foreign exchange and the companys dialysis catheter recall negatively impacted 2000 results by approximately $0.11 and $0.09 per share, respectively. The company recorded several one time items during 2000. Excluding the after tax charge relating to the companys decision not to exercise the Endologix option ($0.53 per share after tax), and the net after tax gain associated with other one time items, primarily asset dispositions and legal settlements ($0.17 per share after tax), diluted earnings per share was $2.45. In 1999, Bard reported net income of $118.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.28. Excluding the impact of the after tax gain on the sale of the cardiopulmonary business of $0.12 per share and the after tax loss associated with the fourth quarter write down of impaired assets of $0.11 per share, diluted earnings per share was $2.27. Financial Condition and Liquidity Bards financial condition remains strong. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. This decrease was the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 16.6% at December 31, 2001, compared to 25.0% at December 31, 2000. In addition, Bard increased its cash and marketable securities position to $271 million at December 31, 2001 from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. , while net debt, or debt less cash and short term investments, to total capitalization was 13.4% at December 31, 2001, compared to 12.2% at December 31, 2000. Shareholders investment was impacted in 2001 by the repurchase of $17.5 million of common stock. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300 million committed credit facility with a $200 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May 2005 and a $100 million 364 day committed credit facility that matures in May 2002.
