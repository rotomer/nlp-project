Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions Our Business For 95 years, C. R. Bard, Inc. has committed its resources to creating innovative solutions to meet the needs of both health care providers and their patients. The company is a global leader in the development, manufacture and supply of products and services to the health care industry. Bard views its product portfolios on a net sales basis by disease state management categories. Disease state management is an approach that expands the focus from products and technologies to the underlying clinical condition. The company believes that disease state management positions the company as an indispensable partner to health care deliverers. Bard is committed to maintaining and developing leadership franchises within these disease states. The company evaluates profitability and associated investments on an enterprise wide basis due to shared geographic infrastructures. Net Sales Bard reported 2002 consolidated net sales of $1,273.8 million, an increase of 8% over the 2001 consolidated net sales of $1,181.3 million. Bards 2001 consolidated net sales increased 8% over the $1,098.8 million consolidated net sales for fiscal 2000. The geographic breakdown by the location of the external customer for each of the last three years is presented below: 2002 2001 2000 United States 73% 73% 72% Europe 17% 17% 17% Japan 5% 5% 5% Rest of world 5% 5% 6% Total net sales 100% 100% 100% Consolidated net sales were affected by price changes that had the effect of increasing consolidated net sales by 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and had the effect of reducing consolidated net sales by 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Consolidated net sales were also affected by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing consolidated net sales by 0.7% in 2002 and decreasing consolidated net sales by 1.1% in 2001. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the United States dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Bards 2002 net sales in the United States of $928.9 million increased 8% over the 2001 net sales in the United States of $862.5 million. Bards 2002 international net sales of $345.1 million increased 8% over the 2001 international net sales of $318.8 million. Adjusting for exchange rate fluctuations, international net sales increased 6% on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended 2002. Bards 2001 net sales in the United States increased 9% over the $788.3 million net sales in the United States for fiscal 2000. Bards 2001 international net sales increased 3% over the $310.5 million international net sales for fiscal 2000. Adjusting for exchange rate fluctuations, international net sales increased 5% on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended 2001. Presented below is a discussion of consolidated net sales by disease state for the fiscal years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000. Product Group Summary of Net Sales (dollars in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 FY 02/01 FY 01/00 Vascular $259,700 $250,900 $241,200 4% 4% Urology 419,700 390,100 361,200 8% 8% Oncology 299,000 274,600 253,000 9% 9% Surgery 229,500 205,200 182,600 12% 12% Other 65,900 60,500 60,800 9% 0% Total net sales $1,273,800 $1,181,300 $1,098,800 8% 8% Vascular Products Bard markets a wide range of products for the peripheral vascular market including interventional radiology products, electrophysiology products and graft products. In total, consolidated net sales of vascular products increased 4% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the prior year. United States net sales of vascular products experienced 5% growth for the year ended 2002 while international net sales increased 2%. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of vascular products increased 4% as compared to the prior year. United States net sales of vascular products experienced 9% growth in fiscal 2001 while international net sales of vascular products decreased 1% in fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year. Interventional radiology products comprised 44% of the vascular products group in fiscal 2002, and net sales of these products increased 12% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. The companys self expanding stent line grew approximately 34% for the year, largely as a result of the introduction of a new 6 French Luminexx&trade; stent. In addition, the Conquest&trade; balloon has powered the companys peripheral angioplasty line, which grew approximately 17% for the year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, interventional radiology sales increased 4% over the prior year. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Net sales of electrophysiology products increased 2% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. United States net sales of electrophysiology products grew 6% for the year ending 2002 while international net sales declined 2% compared to the prior year. The companys electrophysiology business was slow to recover in Germany, where its dedicated sales force experienced high turnover associated with the companys proposed merger with Tyco, which was terminated in the first quarter of 2002. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, electrophysiology net sales increased 10% over the prior year. Graft product sales declined 6% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year due to the loss of a distribution agreement. Graft product sales were essential flat for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the prior year. Urological Products Bard markets a wide range of products for the urological market including basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. In total, consolidated net sales of urological products were $419.7 million an increase of 8% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the prior year. United States net sales represent 76% of total urological sales and grew 7% for the year compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2002 international net sales of urological products increased 10% over the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of urological products increased 8% as compared to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales of urological products experienced 11% growth while international net sales were approximately flat from the prior year. Basic drainage products continue to provide a solid foundation to the companys urology business. Fiscal 2002 basic drainage revenues of $261.8 million increased 7% over the prior year. Approximately one third of the companys 2002 basic drainage revenues were infection control products, which grew 17% over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, basic drainage products grew 1%, with infection control products growing 21% over the prior year. Net sales of urological specialties grew 6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Brachytherapy products were the largest contributor to this increase, with net sales of these products growing 10% over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, brachytherapy products were the largest contributor to urological specialties growth, with net sales of these products increasing over 100% from the prior year to a level of approximately $45.0 million. Continence is the smallest category in urological products. Net sales of continence products grew 13% for the year ended December 31, 2002, led by the companys surgical incontinence line, which grew over 61% from the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, net sales of continence products declined 6% over the prior year primarily due to weak sales in the Contigen&reg; line. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Oncological Products The companys oncological products include specialty access products and gastroenterological products. Consolidated net sales of oncological products increased 9% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2002, United States net sales of oncological products increased 8%, while international net sales increased approximately 14%. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of oncological products increased 9% as compared to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales experienced 6% growth while international net sales increased 17% over the prior year. Specialty access product sales of $206.2 comprised 69% of the oncological product group and increased 12% over the prior year. Peripherally inserted central catheters continue to be the fastest growing products in the specialty access category, growing approximately 35% for fiscal 2002. The Dymax Site Rite&trade; product line grew well at approximately 15% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net sales of specialty access products grew 7% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net sales of gastroenterological products grew 2% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Growth in this product group was derived primarily from international distribution agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2001, gastroenterological products grew 28% due to the growth of new products including EndoCinch&reg;. Surgical Products Consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the prior year. Both the United States and international net sales in surgical products increased 12% for the year ended 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products grew 12% as compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales of surgical products experienced 15% growth while international net sales of surgical products increased 2% over the prior year. The companys hernia product offerings comprised 64% of the surgical product group revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and net sales of these products experienced their strongest growth yet of approximately 26% over the prior year. Ventral hernia products continue to drive the majority of overall hernia growth. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company extended its hernia line with the launch of Ventralex&trade;, a product designed specifically for umbilical hernias. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the companys hernia products grew 21% compared to the prior year. Other Products The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain OEM products. For the year ended December 31, 2002, consolidated net sales of other products were $66.1 million, an increase of 9% from the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of other products were $60.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Costs and Expenses The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years shown: 2002 2001 2000 Cost of goods sold 45.7% 46.6% 45.4% Marketing, selling and administrative 29.6% 30.8% 32.0% Research and development expense 4.8% 4.5% 4.8% Interest expense 1.0% 1.2% 1.8% Other (income) expense, net 2.3% (.4)% 2.0% Total costs and expenses 83.4% 82.7% 86.0% Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 45.7%, a reduction of 0.9% from the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6%. This decrease was primarily due to favorable sales mix and cost improvements. During fiscal 2002, the company recorded nonrecurring charges related to divisional and manufacturing realignments. The companys continuing manufacturing realignment efforts have contributed to the improved margins in fiscal 2002. Primarily due to these realignments, the company expects its cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to continue to decline in 2003. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6% was 1.2% higher than the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 45.4%. Product mix and the impact of currency contributed to this increase. Marketing, selling and administrative The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 29.6%, a reduction of 1.2% from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 30.8%. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 1.2% less than the marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 32.0%. Fiscal year 2001 and 2000 marketing, selling and administrative expense included goodwill amortization of $13.2 million pretax and $13.4 million pretax, respectively. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") of Statements of Financial Accounting ("FAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"("FAS 142"). Research and development expense Fiscal year 2002 research and development expenditures of $61.7 million represented a 15.5% increase over the prior years expenditures of $53.4 million. Included in fiscal 2002 research and development expenditures was a $3.5 million payment associated with the companys recently disclosed agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc. and a milestone payment related to the companys implantable pump project. Fiscal year 2001 research and development expenditures were essentially flat with fiscal year 2000s research and development expenditures of $53.2 million. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Interest expense Fiscal year 2002 interest expense of $12.6 million decreased 11.3% over the prior years interest expense of $14.2 million. Fiscal year 2001 interest expense decreased 26.4% over fiscal year 2000s interest expense of $19.3 million. This is consistent with the companys lower commercial paper levels. Other (income) expense, net (dollars in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Interest income $(6,500) $(6,200) $(3,700) Foreign exchange losses (gains) (300) 1,100 (800) Legal and patent settlements, net (5,000) (1,200) (5,000) Endologix write off and asset impairments 40,300 Acquired R&D 800 9,300 Gains from asset dispositions (500) (11,000) Divisional and manufacturing restructuring 33,700 Merger termination costs 6,200 Other, net 500 100 7,300 Total other (income) expense, net $28,600 $(5,900) $36,400 Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses $15,400 In addition to interest income and exchange gains and losses, 2002 other (income) expense, net includes special charges related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations ($33.7 million pretax) and the termination of the proposed Tyco merger ($6.2 million pretax). These charges are offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals ($5.0 million pretax.) There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In the fiscal year 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses and recorded a gain of $15.4 million pretax. This gain was recorded on a separate line "Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses". In addition, during fiscal 2000 the company recorded a charge of $9.3 million pretax related to product line acquisitions, a gain of $5.0 million pretax related to legal and patent settlements, a gain from asset dispositions of $11.0 million pretax and a charge of $40.3 million pretax related to not exercising an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2002 2001 2000 U.S. federal statutory rate 35% 35% 35% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2% 3% 3% Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (11)% (9)% (9)% Other, net 1% 1% 2% Effective tax rate 27% 30% 31% The 3.0% change in the companys effective tax rate between 2002 and 2001 is primarily attributable to the receipt during 2002 of a new tax grant at a lower rate for the companys Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and the elimination of goodwill amortization per FAS 142. The companys goodwill amortization was primarily nontax deductible. The lower grant rate was retroactively applied to the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 and, accordingly, a $3.5 million nonrecurring tax credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this grant. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million, an increase of 8% over the 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million. Bard reported 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94, a 7% increase over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.75. 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.75 represented increases of 34% and 32% over 2000 consolidated net income of $106.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.09, respectively. Several nonrecurring items affected the results for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table summarizes the impact of nonrecurring items on Bards consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 FY02/01 FY01/00 Net income GAAP basis $155.0 $143.2 $106.9 8% 34% Nonrecurring items 21.7 18.5 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 12.3 12.5 Net Income pro forma $176.7 $155.5 $137.9 14% 13% Diluted earnings per share GAAP basis $2.94 $2.75 $2.09 7% 32% Nonrecurring items 0.41 0.36 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 0.24 0.24 Diluted earnings per share pro forma $3.35 $2.99 $2.69 12% 11% Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) After tax nonrecurring charges In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded charges related to the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement of $4.0 million after tax, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects of $1.7 million after tax and corporate severance related costs of $4.2 million after tax. These charges were offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals of $3.0 million after tax. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded a charge related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit resulting in a net impact of $14.8 million after tax. There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In fiscal 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses, recorded a charge for product line acquisitions, a net gain for legal settlements and asset dispositions and a charge for the writeoff of an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. The net after tax impact of these nonrecurring charges was $18.5 million. Goodwill amortization Fiscal 2001 included $12.3 million after tax goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2000 included $12.5 million after tax goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per FAS 142. Liquidity and Capital Resources Bards financial condition remains strong. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Bard increased its cash and short term investments to $383.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $271.0 million at December 31, 2001 and from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. (dollars in millions) Fiscal Years 2002 2001 2000 Cash and short term investments $383.2 $271.0 $119.7 Working capital $441.1 $391.0 $302.1 Current ratio 2.39/1 2.40/1 2.35/1 Net cash position $230.1 $113.8 ($85.4) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash and short term investments less total debt. Cash and short term investments held in foreign currencies are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. These decreases were the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Bards 2002 net sales in the United States of $928.9 million increased 8% over the 2001 net sales in the United States of $862.5 million. Bards 2002 international net sales of $345.1 million increased 8% over the 2001 international net sales of $318.8 million. Adjusting for exchange rate fluctuations, international net sales increased 6% on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended 2002. Bards 2001 net sales in the United States increased 9% over the $788.3 million net sales in the United States for fiscal 2000. Bards 2001 international net sales increased 3% over the $310.5 million international net sales for fiscal 2000. Adjusting for exchange rate fluctuations, international net sales increased 5% on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended 2001. Presented below is a discussion of consolidated net sales by disease state for the fiscal years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000. Product Group Summary of Net Sales (dollars in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 FY 02/01 FY 01/00 Vascular $259,700 $250,900 $241,200 4% 4% Urology 419,700 390,100 361,200 8% 8% Oncology 299,000 274,600 253,000 9% 9% Surgery 229,500 205,200 182,600 12% 12% Other 65,900 60,500 60,800 9% 0% Total net sales $1,273,800 $1,181,300 $1,098,800 8% 8% Vascular Products Bard markets a wide range of products for the peripheral vascular market including interventional radiology products, electrophysiology products and graft products. In total, consolidated net sales of vascular products increased 4% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the prior year. United States net sales of vascular products experienced 5% growth for the year ended 2002 while international net sales increased 2%. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of vascular products increased 4% as compared to the prior year. United States net sales of vascular products experienced 9% growth in fiscal 2001 while international net sales of vascular products decreased 1% in fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year. Interventional radiology products comprised 44% of the vascular products group in fiscal 2002, and net sales of these products increased 12% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. The companys self expanding stent line grew approximately 34% for the year, largely as a result of the introduction of a new 6 French Luminexx&trade; stent. In addition, the Conquest&trade; balloon has powered the companys peripheral angioplasty line, which grew approximately 17% for the year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, interventional radiology sales increased 4% over the prior year. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Net sales of electrophysiology products increased 2% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. United States net sales of electrophysiology products grew 6% for the year ending 2002 while international net sales declined 2% compared to the prior year. The companys electrophysiology business was slow to recover in Germany, where its dedicated sales force experienced high turnover associated with the companys proposed merger with Tyco, which was terminated in the first quarter of 2002. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, electrophysiology net sales increased 10% over the prior year. Graft product sales declined 6% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year due to the loss of a distribution agreement. Graft product sales were essential flat for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the prior year. Urological Products Bard markets a wide range of products for the urological market including basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. In total, consolidated net sales of urological products were $419.7 million an increase of 8% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the prior year. United States net sales represent 76% of total urological sales and grew 7% for the year compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2002 international net sales of urological products increased 10% over the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of urological products increased 8% as compared to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales of urological products experienced 11% growth while international net sales were approximately flat from the prior year. Basic drainage products continue to provide a solid foundation to the companys urology business. Fiscal 2002 basic drainage revenues of $261.8 million increased 7% over the prior year. Approximately one third of the companys 2002 basic drainage revenues were infection control products, which grew 17% over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, basic drainage products grew 1%, with infection control products growing 21% over the prior year. Net sales of urological specialties grew 6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Brachytherapy products were the largest contributor to this increase, with net sales of these products growing 10% over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, brachytherapy products were the largest contributor to urological specialties growth, with net sales of these products increasing over 100% from the prior year to a level of approximately $45.0 million. Continence is the smallest category in urological products. Net sales of continence products grew 13% for the year ended December 31, 2002, led by the companys surgical incontinence line, which grew over 61% from the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, net sales of continence products declined 6% over the prior year primarily due to weak sales in the Contigen&reg; line. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Oncological Products The companys oncological products include specialty access products and gastroenterological products. Consolidated net sales of oncological products increased 9% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2002, United States net sales of oncological products increased 8%, while international net sales increased approximately 14%. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of oncological products increased 9% as compared to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales experienced 6% growth while international net sales increased 17% over the prior year. Specialty access product sales of $206.2 comprised 69% of the oncological product group and increased 12% over the prior year. Peripherally inserted central catheters continue to be the fastest growing products in the specialty access category, growing approximately 35% for fiscal 2002. The Dymax Site Rite&trade; product line grew well at approximately 15% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net sales of specialty access products grew 7% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net sales of gastroenterological products grew 2% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Growth in this product group was derived primarily from international distribution agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2001, gastroenterological products grew 28% due to the growth of new products including EndoCinch&reg;. Surgical Products Consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the prior year. Both the United States and international net sales in surgical products increased 12% for the year ended 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products grew 12% as compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales of surgical products experienced 15% growth while international net sales of surgical products increased 2% over the prior year. The companys hernia product offerings comprised 64% of the surgical product group revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and net sales of these products experienced their strongest growth yet of approximately 26% over the prior year. Ventral hernia products continue to drive the majority of overall hernia growth. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company extended its hernia line with the launch of Ventralex&trade;, a product designed specifically for umbilical hernias. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the companys hernia products grew 21% compared to the prior year. Other Products The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain OEM products. For the year ended December 31, 2002, consolidated net sales of other products were $66.1 million, an increase of 9% from the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of other products were $60.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Costs and Expenses The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years shown: 2002 2001 2000 Cost of goods sold 45.7% 46.6% 45.4% Marketing, selling and administrative 29.6% 30.8% 32.0% Research and development expense 4.8% 4.5% 4.8% Interest expense 1.0% 1.2% 1.8% Other (income) expense, net 2.3% (.4)% 2.0% Total costs and expenses 83.4% 82.7% 86.0% Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 45.7%, a reduction of 0.9% from the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6%. This decrease was primarily due to favorable sales mix and cost improvements. During fiscal 2002, the company recorded nonrecurring charges related to divisional and manufacturing realignments. The companys continuing manufacturing realignment efforts have contributed to the improved margins in fiscal 2002. Primarily due to these realignments, the company expects its cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to continue to decline in 2003. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6% was 1.2% higher than the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 45.4%. Product mix and the impact of currency contributed to this increase. Marketing, selling and administrative The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 29.6%, a reduction of 1.2% from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 30.8%. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 1.2% less than the marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 32.0%. Fiscal year 2001 and 2000 marketing, selling and administrative expense included goodwill amortization of $13.2 million pretax and $13.4 million pretax, respectively. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") of Statements of Financial Accounting ("FAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"("FAS 142"). Research and development expense Fiscal year 2002 research and development expenditures of $61.7 million represented a 15.5% increase over the prior years expenditures of $53.4 million. Included in fiscal 2002 research and development expenditures was a $3.5 million payment associated with the companys recently disclosed agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc. and a milestone payment related to the companys implantable pump project. Fiscal year 2001 research and development expenditures were essentially flat with fiscal year 2000s research and development expenditures of $53.2 million. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Interest expense Fiscal year 2002 interest expense of $12.6 million decreased 11.3% over the prior years interest expense of $14.2 million. Fiscal year 2001 interest expense decreased 26.4% over fiscal year 2000s interest expense of $19.3 million. This is consistent with the companys lower commercial paper levels. Other (income) expense, net (dollars in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Interest income $(6,500) $(6,200) $(3,700) Foreign exchange losses (gains) (300) 1,100 (800) Legal and patent settlements, net (5,000) (1,200) (5,000) Endologix write off and asset impairments 40,300 Acquired R&D 800 9,300 Gains from asset dispositions (500) (11,000) Divisional and manufacturing restructuring 33,700 Merger termination costs 6,200 Other, net 500 100 7,300 Total other (income) expense, net $28,600 $(5,900) $36,400 Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses $15,400 In addition to interest income and exchange gains and losses, 2002 other (income) expense, net includes special charges related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations ($33.7 million pretax) and the termination of the proposed Tyco merger ($6.2 million pretax). These charges are offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals ($5.0 million pretax.) There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In the fiscal year 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses and recorded a gain of $15.4 million pretax. This gain was recorded on a separate line "Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses". In addition, during fiscal 2000 the company recorded a charge of $9.3 million pretax related to product line acquisitions, a gain of $5.0 million pretax related to legal and patent settlements, a gain from asset dispositions of $11.0 million pretax and a charge of $40.3 million pretax related to not exercising an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2002 2001 2000 U.S. federal statutory rate 35% 35% 35% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2% 3% 3% Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (11)% (9)% (9)% Other, net 1% 1% 2% Effective tax rate 27% 30% 31% The 3.0% change in the companys effective tax rate between 2002 and 2001 is primarily attributable to the receipt during 2002 of a new tax grant at a lower rate for the companys Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and the elimination of goodwill amortization per FAS 142. The companys goodwill amortization was primarily nontax deductible. The lower grant rate was retroactively applied to the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 and, accordingly, a $3.5 million nonrecurring tax credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this grant. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million, an increase of 8% over the 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million. Bard reported 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94, a 7% increase over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.75. 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.75 represented increases of 34% and 32% over 2000 consolidated net income of $106.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.09, respectively. Several nonrecurring items affected the results for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table summarizes the impact of nonrecurring items on Bards consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 FY02/01 FY01/00 Net income GAAP basis $155.0 $143.2 $106.9 8% 34% Nonrecurring items 21.7 18.5 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 12.3 12.5 Net Income pro forma $176.7 $155.5 $137.9 14% 13% Diluted earnings per share GAAP basis $2.94 $2.75 $2.09 7% 32% Nonrecurring items 0.41 0.36 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 0.24 0.24 Diluted earnings per share pro forma $3.35 $2.99 $2.69 12% 11% Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) After tax nonrecurring charges In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded charges related to the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement of $4.0 million after tax, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects of $1.7 million after tax and corporate severance related costs of $4.2 million after tax. These charges were offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals of $3.0 million after tax. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded a charge related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit resulting in a net impact of $14.8 million after tax. There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In fiscal 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses, recorded a charge for product line acquisitions, a net gain for legal settlements and asset dispositions and a charge for the writeoff of an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. The net after tax impact of these nonrecurring charges was $18.5 million. Goodwill amortization Fiscal 2001 included $12.3 million after tax goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2000 included $12.5 million after tax goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per FAS 142. Liquidity and Capital Resources Bards financial condition remains strong. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Bard increased its cash and short term investments to $383.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $271.0 million at December 31, 2001 and from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. (dollars in millions) Fiscal Years 2002 2001 2000 Cash and short term investments $383.2 $271.0 $119.7 Working capital $441.1 $391.0 $302.1 Current ratio 2.39/1 2.40/1 2.35/1 Net cash position $230.1 $113.8 ($85.4) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash and short term investments less total debt. Cash and short term investments held in foreign currencies are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. These decreases were the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Net sales of electrophysiology products increased 2% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. United States net sales of electrophysiology products grew 6% for the year ending 2002 while international net sales declined 2% compared to the prior year. The companys electrophysiology business was slow to recover in Germany, where its dedicated sales force experienced high turnover associated with the companys proposed merger with Tyco, which was terminated in the first quarter of 2002. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, electrophysiology net sales increased 10% over the prior year. Graft product sales declined 6% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year due to the loss of a distribution agreement. Graft product sales were essential flat for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the prior year. Urological Products Bard markets a wide range of products for the urological market including basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. In total, consolidated net sales of urological products were $419.7 million an increase of 8% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the prior year. United States net sales represent 76% of total urological sales and grew 7% for the year compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2002 international net sales of urological products increased 10% over the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of urological products increased 8% as compared to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales of urological products experienced 11% growth while international net sales were approximately flat from the prior year. Basic drainage products continue to provide a solid foundation to the companys urology business. Fiscal 2002 basic drainage revenues of $261.8 million increased 7% over the prior year. Approximately one third of the companys 2002 basic drainage revenues were infection control products, which grew 17% over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, basic drainage products grew 1%, with infection control products growing 21% over the prior year. Net sales of urological specialties grew 6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Brachytherapy products were the largest contributor to this increase, with net sales of these products growing 10% over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, brachytherapy products were the largest contributor to urological specialties growth, with net sales of these products increasing over 100% from the prior year to a level of approximately $45.0 million. Continence is the smallest category in urological products. Net sales of continence products grew 13% for the year ended December 31, 2002, led by the companys surgical incontinence line, which grew over 61% from the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, net sales of continence products declined 6% over the prior year primarily due to weak sales in the Contigen&reg; line. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Oncological Products The companys oncological products include specialty access products and gastroenterological products. Consolidated net sales of oncological products increased 9% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2002, United States net sales of oncological products increased 8%, while international net sales increased approximately 14%. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of oncological products increased 9% as compared to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales experienced 6% growth while international net sales increased 17% over the prior year. Specialty access product sales of $206.2 comprised 69% of the oncological product group and increased 12% over the prior year. Peripherally inserted central catheters continue to be the fastest growing products in the specialty access category, growing approximately 35% for fiscal 2002. The Dymax Site Rite&trade; product line grew well at approximately 15% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net sales of specialty access products grew 7% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net sales of gastroenterological products grew 2% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Growth in this product group was derived primarily from international distribution agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2001, gastroenterological products grew 28% due to the growth of new products including EndoCinch&reg;. Surgical Products Consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the prior year. Both the United States and international net sales in surgical products increased 12% for the year ended 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products grew 12% as compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales of surgical products experienced 15% growth while international net sales of surgical products increased 2% over the prior year. The companys hernia product offerings comprised 64% of the surgical product group revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and net sales of these products experienced their strongest growth yet of approximately 26% over the prior year. Ventral hernia products continue to drive the majority of overall hernia growth. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company extended its hernia line with the launch of Ventralex&trade;, a product designed specifically for umbilical hernias. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the companys hernia products grew 21% compared to the prior year. Other Products The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain OEM products. For the year ended December 31, 2002, consolidated net sales of other products were $66.1 million, an increase of 9% from the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of other products were $60.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Costs and Expenses The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years shown: 2002 2001 2000 Cost of goods sold 45.7% 46.6% 45.4% Marketing, selling and administrative 29.6% 30.8% 32.0% Research and development expense 4.8% 4.5% 4.8% Interest expense 1.0% 1.2% 1.8% Other (income) expense, net 2.3% (.4)% 2.0% Total costs and expenses 83.4% 82.7% 86.0% Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 45.7%, a reduction of 0.9% from the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6%. This decrease was primarily due to favorable sales mix and cost improvements. During fiscal 2002, the company recorded nonrecurring charges related to divisional and manufacturing realignments. The companys continuing manufacturing realignment efforts have contributed to the improved margins in fiscal 2002. Primarily due to these realignments, the company expects its cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to continue to decline in 2003. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6% was 1.2% higher than the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 45.4%. Product mix and the impact of currency contributed to this increase. Marketing, selling and administrative The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 29.6%, a reduction of 1.2% from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 30.8%. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 1.2% less than the marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 32.0%. Fiscal year 2001 and 2000 marketing, selling and administrative expense included goodwill amortization of $13.2 million pretax and $13.4 million pretax, respectively. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") of Statements of Financial Accounting ("FAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"("FAS 142"). Research and development expense Fiscal year 2002 research and development expenditures of $61.7 million represented a 15.5% increase over the prior years expenditures of $53.4 million. Included in fiscal 2002 research and development expenditures was a $3.5 million payment associated with the companys recently disclosed agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc. and a milestone payment related to the companys implantable pump project. Fiscal year 2001 research and development expenditures were essentially flat with fiscal year 2000s research and development expenditures of $53.2 million. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Interest expense Fiscal year 2002 interest expense of $12.6 million decreased 11.3% over the prior years interest expense of $14.2 million. Fiscal year 2001 interest expense decreased 26.4% over fiscal year 2000s interest expense of $19.3 million. This is consistent with the companys lower commercial paper levels.

These charges are offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals ($5.0 million pretax.) There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In the fiscal year 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses and recorded a gain of $15.4 million pretax. This gain was recorded on a separate line "Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses". In addition, during fiscal 2000 the company recorded a charge of $9.3 million pretax related to product line acquisitions, a gain of $5.0 million pretax related to legal and patent settlements, a gain from asset dispositions of $11.0 million pretax and a charge of $40.3 million pretax related to not exercising an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2002 2001 2000 U.S. federal statutory rate 35% 35% 35% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2% 3% 3% Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (11)% (9)% (9)% Other, net 1% 1% 2% Effective tax rate 27% 30% 31% The 3.0% change in the companys effective tax rate between 2002 and 2001 is primarily attributable to the receipt during 2002 of a new tax grant at a lower rate for the companys Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and the elimination of goodwill amortization per FAS 142. The companys goodwill amortization was primarily nontax deductible. The lower grant rate was retroactively applied to the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 and, accordingly, a $3.5 million nonrecurring tax credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this grant. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million, an increase of 8% over the 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million. Bard reported 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94, a 7% increase over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.75. 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.75 represented increases of 34% and 32% over 2000 consolidated net income of $106.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.09, respectively. Several nonrecurring items affected the results for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table summarizes the impact of nonrecurring items on Bards consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 FY02/01 FY01/00 Net income GAAP basis $155.0 $143.2 $106.9 8% 34% Nonrecurring items 21.7 18.5 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 12.3 12.5 Net Income pro forma $176.7 $155.5 $137.9 14% 13% Diluted earnings per share GAAP basis $2.94 $2.75 $2.09 7% 32% Nonrecurring items 0.41 0.36 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 0.24 0.24 Diluted earnings per share pro forma $3.35 $2.99 $2.69 12% 11% Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) After tax nonrecurring charges In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded charges related to the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement of $4.0 million after tax, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects of $1.7 million after tax and corporate severance related costs of $4.2 million after tax. These charges were offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals of $3.0 million after tax. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded a charge related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit resulting in a net impact of $14.8 million after tax. There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In fiscal 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses, recorded a charge for product line acquisitions, a net gain for legal settlements and asset dispositions and a charge for the writeoff of an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. The net after tax impact of these nonrecurring charges was $18.5 million. Goodwill amortization Fiscal 2001 included $12.3 million after tax goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2000 included $12.5 million after tax goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per FAS 142. Liquidity and Capital Resources Bards financial condition remains strong. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Bard increased its cash and short term investments to $383.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $271.0 million at December 31, 2001 and from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. (dollars in millions) Fiscal Years 2002 2001 2000 Cash and short term investments $383.2 $271.0 $119.7 Working capital $441.1 $391.0 $302.1 Current ratio 2.39/1 2.40/1 2.35/1 Net cash position $230.1 $113.8 ($85.4) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash and short term investments less total debt. Cash and short term investments held in foreign currencies are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. These decreases were the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Oncological Products The companys oncological products include specialty access products and gastroenterological products. Consolidated net sales of oncological products increased 9% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2002, United States net sales of oncological products increased 8%, while international net sales increased approximately 14%. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of oncological products increased 9% as compared to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales experienced 6% growth while international net sales increased 17% over the prior year. Specialty access product sales of $206.2 comprised 69% of the oncological product group and increased 12% over the prior year. Peripherally inserted central catheters continue to be the fastest growing products in the specialty access category, growing approximately 35% for fiscal 2002. The Dymax Site Rite&trade; product line grew well at approximately 15% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net sales of specialty access products grew 7% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net sales of gastroenterological products grew 2% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Growth in this product group was derived primarily from international distribution agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2001, gastroenterological products grew 28% due to the growth of new products including EndoCinch&reg;. Surgical Products Consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the prior year. Both the United States and international net sales in surgical products increased 12% for the year ended 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products grew 12% as compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, United States net sales of surgical products experienced 15% growth while international net sales of surgical products increased 2% over the prior year. The companys hernia product offerings comprised 64% of the surgical product group revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and net sales of these products experienced their strongest growth yet of approximately 26% over the prior year. Ventral hernia products continue to drive the majority of overall hernia growth. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company extended its hernia line with the launch of Ventralex&trade;, a product designed specifically for umbilical hernias. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the companys hernia products grew 21% compared to the prior year. Other Products The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain OEM products. For the year ended December 31, 2002, consolidated net sales of other products were $66.1 million, an increase of 9% from the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2001, consolidated net sales of other products were $60.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Costs and Expenses The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years shown: 2002 2001 2000 Cost of goods sold 45.7% 46.6% 45.4% Marketing, selling and administrative 29.6% 30.8% 32.0% Research and development expense 4.8% 4.5% 4.8% Interest expense 1.0% 1.2% 1.8% Other (income) expense, net 2.3% (.4)% 2.0% Total costs and expenses 83.4% 82.7% 86.0% Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 45.7%, a reduction of 0.9% from the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6%. This decrease was primarily due to favorable sales mix and cost improvements. During fiscal 2002, the company recorded nonrecurring charges related to divisional and manufacturing realignments. The companys continuing manufacturing realignment efforts have contributed to the improved margins in fiscal 2002. Primarily due to these realignments, the company expects its cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to continue to decline in 2003. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6% was 1.2% higher than the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 45.4%. Product mix and the impact of currency contributed to this increase. Marketing, selling and administrative The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 29.6%, a reduction of 1.2% from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 30.8%. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 1.2% less than the marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 32.0%. Fiscal year 2001 and 2000 marketing, selling and administrative expense included goodwill amortization of $13.2 million pretax and $13.4 million pretax, respectively. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") of Statements of Financial Accounting ("FAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"("FAS 142"). Research and development expense Fiscal year 2002 research and development expenditures of $61.7 million represented a 15.5% increase over the prior years expenditures of $53.4 million. Included in fiscal 2002 research and development expenditures was a $3.5 million payment associated with the companys recently disclosed agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc. and a milestone payment related to the companys implantable pump project. Fiscal year 2001 research and development expenditures were essentially flat with fiscal year 2000s research and development expenditures of $53.2 million. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Interest expense Fiscal year 2002 interest expense of $12.6 million decreased 11.3% over the prior years interest expense of $14.2 million. Fiscal year 2001 interest expense decreased 26.4% over fiscal year 2000s interest expense of $19.3 million. This is consistent with the companys lower commercial paper levels. Other (income) expense, net (dollars in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Interest income $(6,500) $(6,200) $(3,700) Foreign exchange losses (gains) (300) 1,100 (800) Legal and patent settlements, net (5,000) (1,200) (5,000) Endologix write off and asset impairments 40,300 Acquired R&D 800 9,300 Gains from asset dispositions (500) (11,000) Divisional and manufacturing restructuring 33,700 Merger termination costs 6,200 Other, net 500 100 7,300 Total other (income) expense, net $28,600 $(5,900) $36,400 Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses $15,400 In addition to interest income and exchange gains and losses, 2002 other (income) expense, net includes special charges related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations ($33.7 million pretax) and the termination of the proposed Tyco merger ($6.2 million pretax). These charges are offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals ($5.0 million pretax.) There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In the fiscal year 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses and recorded a gain of $15.4 million pretax. This gain was recorded on a separate line "Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses". In addition, during fiscal 2000 the company recorded a charge of $9.3 million pretax related to product line acquisitions, a gain of $5.0 million pretax related to legal and patent settlements, a gain from asset dispositions of $11.0 million pretax and a charge of $40.3 million pretax related to not exercising an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2002 2001 2000 U.S. federal statutory rate 35% 35% 35% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2% 3% 3% Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (11)% (9)% (9)% Other, net 1% 1% 2% Effective tax rate 27% 30% 31% The 3.0% change in the companys effective tax rate between 2002 and 2001 is primarily attributable to the receipt during 2002 of a new tax grant at a lower rate for the companys Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and the elimination of goodwill amortization per FAS 142. The companys goodwill amortization was primarily nontax deductible. The lower grant rate was retroactively applied to the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 and, accordingly, a $3.5 million nonrecurring tax credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this grant. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million, an increase of 8% over the 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million. Bard reported 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94, a 7% increase over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.75. 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.75 represented increases of 34% and 32% over 2000 consolidated net income of $106.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.09, respectively. Several nonrecurring items affected the results for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table summarizes the impact of nonrecurring items on Bards consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 FY02/01 FY01/00 Net income GAAP basis $155.0 $143.2 $106.9 8% 34% Nonrecurring items 21.7 18.5 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 12.3 12.5 Net Income pro forma $176.7 $155.5 $137.9 14% 13% Diluted earnings per share GAAP basis $2.94 $2.75 $2.09 7% 32% Nonrecurring items 0.41 0.36 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 0.24 0.24 Diluted earnings per share pro forma $3.35 $2.99 $2.69 12% 11% Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) After tax nonrecurring charges In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded charges related to the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement of $4.0 million after tax, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects of $1.7 million after tax and corporate severance related costs of $4.2 million after tax. These charges were offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals of $3.0 million after tax. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded a charge related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit resulting in a net impact of $14.8 million after tax. There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In fiscal 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses, recorded a charge for product line acquisitions, a net gain for legal settlements and asset dispositions and a charge for the writeoff of an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. The net after tax impact of these nonrecurring charges was $18.5 million. Goodwill amortization Fiscal 2001 included $12.3 million after tax goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2000 included $12.5 million after tax goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per FAS 142. Liquidity and Capital Resources Bards financial condition remains strong. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Bard increased its cash and short term investments to $383.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $271.0 million at December 31, 2001 and from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. (dollars in millions) Fiscal Years 2002 2001 2000 Cash and short term investments $383.2 $271.0 $119.7 Working capital $441.1 $391.0 $302.1 Current ratio 2.39/1 2.40/1 2.35/1 Net cash position $230.1 $113.8 ($85.4) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash and short term investments less total debt. Cash and short term investments held in foreign currencies are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. These decreases were the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Costs and Expenses The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years shown: 2002 2001 2000 Cost of goods sold 45.7% 46.6% 45.4% Marketing, selling and administrative 29.6% 30.8% 32.0% Research and development expense 4.8% 4.5% 4.8% Interest expense 1.0% 1.2% 1.8% Other (income) expense, net 2.3% (.4)% 2.0% Total costs and expenses 83.4% 82.7% 86.0% Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 45.7%, a reduction of 0.9% from the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6%. This decrease was primarily due to favorable sales mix and cost improvements. During fiscal 2002, the company recorded nonrecurring charges related to divisional and manufacturing realignments. The companys continuing manufacturing realignment efforts have contributed to the improved margins in fiscal 2002. Primarily due to these realignments, the company expects its cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to continue to decline in 2003. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6% was 1.2% higher than the cost of goods sold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 45.4%. Product mix and the impact of currency contributed to this increase. Marketing, selling and administrative The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 29.6%, a reduction of 1.2% from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 30.8%. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 1.2% less than the marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 32.0%. Fiscal year 2001 and 2000 marketing, selling and administrative expense included goodwill amortization of $13.2 million pretax and $13.4 million pretax, respectively. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") of Statements of Financial Accounting ("FAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"("FAS 142"). Research and development expense Fiscal year 2002 research and development expenditures of $61.7 million represented a 15.5% increase over the prior years expenditures of $53.4 million. Included in fiscal 2002 research and development expenditures was a $3.5 million payment associated with the companys recently disclosed agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc. and a milestone payment related to the companys implantable pump project. Fiscal year 2001 research and development expenditures were essentially flat with fiscal year 2000s research and development expenditures of $53.2 million. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Interest expense Fiscal year 2002 interest expense of $12.6 million decreased 11.3% over the prior years interest expense of $14.2 million. Fiscal year 2001 interest expense decreased 26.4% over fiscal year 2000s interest expense of $19.3 million. This is consistent with the companys lower commercial paper levels. Other (income) expense, net (dollars in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Interest income $(6,500) $(6,200) $(3,700) Foreign exchange losses (gains) (300) 1,100 (800) Legal and patent settlements, net (5,000) (1,200) (5,000) Endologix write off and asset impairments 40,300 Acquired R&D 800 9,300 Gains from asset dispositions (500) (11,000) Divisional and manufacturing restructuring 33,700 Merger termination costs 6,200 Other, net 500 100 7,300 Total other (income) expense, net $28,600 $(5,900) $36,400 Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses $15,400 In addition to interest income and exchange gains and losses, 2002 other (income) expense, net includes special charges related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations ($33.7 million pretax) and the termination of the proposed Tyco merger ($6.2 million pretax). These charges are offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals ($5.0 million pretax.) There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In the fiscal year 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses and recorded a gain of $15.4 million pretax. This gain was recorded on a separate line "Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses". In addition, during fiscal 2000 the company recorded a charge of $9.3 million pretax related to product line acquisitions, a gain of $5.0 million pretax related to legal and patent settlements, a gain from asset dispositions of $11.0 million pretax and a charge of $40.3 million pretax related to not exercising an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2002 2001 2000 U.S. federal statutory rate 35% 35% 35% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2% 3% 3% Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (11)% (9)% (9)% Other, net 1% 1% 2% Effective tax rate 27% 30% 31% The 3.0% change in the companys effective tax rate between 2002 and 2001 is primarily attributable to the receipt during 2002 of a new tax grant at a lower rate for the companys Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and the elimination of goodwill amortization per FAS 142. The companys goodwill amortization was primarily nontax deductible. The lower grant rate was retroactively applied to the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 and, accordingly, a $3.5 million nonrecurring tax credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this grant. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million, an increase of 8% over the 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million. Bard reported 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94, a 7% increase over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.75. 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.75 represented increases of 34% and 32% over 2000 consolidated net income of $106.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.09, respectively. Several nonrecurring items affected the results for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table summarizes the impact of nonrecurring items on Bards consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 FY02/01 FY01/00 Net income GAAP basis $155.0 $143.2 $106.9 8% 34% Nonrecurring items 21.7 18.5 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 12.3 12.5 Net Income pro forma $176.7 $155.5 $137.9 14% 13% Diluted earnings per share GAAP basis $2.94 $2.75 $2.09 7% 32% Nonrecurring items 0.41 0.36 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 0.24 0.24 Diluted earnings per share pro forma $3.35 $2.99 $2.69 12% 11% Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) After tax nonrecurring charges In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded charges related to the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement of $4.0 million after tax, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects of $1.7 million after tax and corporate severance related costs of $4.2 million after tax. These charges were offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals of $3.0 million after tax. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded a charge related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit resulting in a net impact of $14.8 million after tax. There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In fiscal 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses, recorded a charge for product line acquisitions, a net gain for legal settlements and asset dispositions and a charge for the writeoff of an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. The net after tax impact of these nonrecurring charges was $18.5 million. Goodwill amortization Fiscal 2001 included $12.3 million after tax goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2000 included $12.5 million after tax goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per FAS 142. Liquidity and Capital Resources Bards financial condition remains strong. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Bard increased its cash and short term investments to $383.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $271.0 million at December 31, 2001 and from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. (dollars in millions) Fiscal Years 2002 2001 2000 Cash and short term investments $383.2 $271.0 $119.7 Working capital $441.1 $391.0 $302.1 Current ratio 2.39/1 2.40/1 2.35/1 Net cash position $230.1 $113.8 ($85.4) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash and short term investments less total debt. Cash and short term investments held in foreign currencies are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. These decreases were the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Interest expense Fiscal year 2002 interest expense of $12.6 million decreased 11.3% over the prior years interest expense of $14.2 million. Fiscal year 2001 interest expense decreased 26.4% over fiscal year 2000s interest expense of $19.3 million. This is consistent with the companys lower commercial paper levels. Other (income) expense, net (dollars in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Interest income $(6,500) $(6,200) $(3,700) Foreign exchange losses (gains) (300) 1,100 (800) Legal and patent settlements, net (5,000) (1,200) (5,000) Endologix write off and asset impairments 40,300 Acquired R&D 800 9,300 Gains from asset dispositions (500) (11,000) Divisional and manufacturing restructuring 33,700 Merger termination costs 6,200 Other, net 500 100 7,300 Total other (income) expense, net $28,600 $(5,900) $36,400 Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses $15,400 In addition to interest income and exchange gains and losses, 2002 other (income) expense, net includes special charges related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations ($33.7 million pretax) and the termination of the proposed Tyco merger ($6.2 million pretax). These charges are offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals ($5.0 million pretax.) There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In the fiscal year 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses and recorded a gain of $15.4 million pretax. This gain was recorded on a separate line "Gain from dispositions of cardiology businesses". In addition, during fiscal 2000 the company recorded a charge of $9.3 million pretax related to product line acquisitions, a gain of $5.0 million pretax related to legal and patent settlements, a gain from asset dispositions of $11.0 million pretax and a charge of $40.3 million pretax related to not exercising an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2002 2001 2000 U.S. federal statutory rate 35% 35% 35% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2% 3% 3% Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (11)% (9)% (9)% Other, net 1% 1% 2% Effective tax rate 27% 30% 31% The 3.0% change in the companys effective tax rate between 2002 and 2001 is primarily attributable to the receipt during 2002 of a new tax grant at a lower rate for the companys Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and the elimination of goodwill amortization per FAS 142. The companys goodwill amortization was primarily nontax deductible. The lower grant rate was retroactively applied to the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 and, accordingly, a $3.5 million nonrecurring tax credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this grant. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million, an increase of 8% over the 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million. Bard reported 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94, a 7% increase over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.75. 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.75 represented increases of 34% and 32% over 2000 consolidated net income of $106.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.09, respectively. Several nonrecurring items affected the results for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table summarizes the impact of nonrecurring items on Bards consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 FY02/01 FY01/00 Net income GAAP basis $155.0 $143.2 $106.9 8% 34% Nonrecurring items 21.7 18.5 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 12.3 12.5 Net Income pro forma $176.7 $155.5 $137.9 14% 13% Diluted earnings per share GAAP basis $2.94 $2.75 $2.09 7% 32% Nonrecurring items 0.41 0.36 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 0.24 0.24 Diluted earnings per share pro forma $3.35 $2.99 $2.69 12% 11% Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) After tax nonrecurring charges In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded charges related to the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement of $4.0 million after tax, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects of $1.7 million after tax and corporate severance related costs of $4.2 million after tax. These charges were offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals of $3.0 million after tax. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded a charge related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit resulting in a net impact of $14.8 million after tax. There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In fiscal 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses, recorded a charge for product line acquisitions, a net gain for legal settlements and asset dispositions and a charge for the writeoff of an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. The net after tax impact of these nonrecurring charges was $18.5 million. Goodwill amortization Fiscal 2001 included $12.3 million after tax goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2000 included $12.5 million after tax goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per FAS 142. Liquidity and Capital Resources Bards financial condition remains strong. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Bard increased its cash and short term investments to $383.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $271.0 million at December 31, 2001 and from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. (dollars in millions) Fiscal Years 2002 2001 2000 Cash and short term investments $383.2 $271.0 $119.7 Working capital $441.1 $391.0 $302.1 Current ratio 2.39/1 2.40/1 2.35/1 Net cash position $230.1 $113.8 ($85.4) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash and short term investments less total debt. Cash and short term investments held in foreign currencies are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. These decreases were the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2002 2001 2000 U.S. federal statutory rate 35% 35% 35% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2% 3% 3% Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (11)% (9)% (9)% Other, net 1% 1% 2% Effective tax rate 27% 30% 31% The 3.0% change in the companys effective tax rate between 2002 and 2001 is primarily attributable to the receipt during 2002 of a new tax grant at a lower rate for the companys Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and the elimination of goodwill amortization per FAS 142. The companys goodwill amortization was primarily nontax deductible. The lower grant rate was retroactively applied to the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 and, accordingly, a $3.5 million nonrecurring tax credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this grant. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million, an increase of 8% over the 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million. Bard reported 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94, a 7% increase over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.75. 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.75 represented increases of 34% and 32% over 2000 consolidated net income of $106.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.09, respectively. Several nonrecurring items affected the results for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table summarizes the impact of nonrecurring items on Bards consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 FY02/01 FY01/00 Net income GAAP basis $155.0 $143.2 $106.9 8% 34% Nonrecurring items 21.7 18.5 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 12.3 12.5 Net Income pro forma $176.7 $155.5 $137.9 14% 13% Diluted earnings per share GAAP basis $2.94 $2.75 $2.09 7% 32% Nonrecurring items 0.41 0.36 After tax impact of goodwill amortization 0.24 0.24 Diluted earnings per share pro forma $3.35 $2.99 $2.69 12% 11% Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) After tax nonrecurring charges In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded charges related to the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement of $4.0 million after tax, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects of $1.7 million after tax and corporate severance related costs of $4.2 million after tax. These charges were offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals of $3.0 million after tax. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded a charge related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit resulting in a net impact of $14.8 million after tax. There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In fiscal 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses, recorded a charge for product line acquisitions, a net gain for legal settlements and asset dispositions and a charge for the writeoff of an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. The net after tax impact of these nonrecurring charges was $18.5 million. Goodwill amortization Fiscal 2001 included $12.3 million after tax goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2000 included $12.5 million after tax goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per FAS 142. Liquidity and Capital Resources Bards financial condition remains strong. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Bard increased its cash and short term investments to $383.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $271.0 million at December 31, 2001 and from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. (dollars in millions) Fiscal Years 2002 2001 2000 Cash and short term investments $383.2 $271.0 $119.7 Working capital $441.1 $391.0 $302.1 Current ratio 2.39/1 2.40/1 2.35/1 Net cash position $230.1 $113.8 ($85.4) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash and short term investments less total debt. Cash and short term investments held in foreign currencies are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. These decreases were the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) After tax nonrecurring charges In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded charges related to the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement of $4.0 million after tax, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects of $1.7 million after tax and corporate severance related costs of $4.2 million after tax. These charges were offset with the reversal of certain legal accruals of $3.0 million after tax. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded a charge related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit resulting in a net impact of $14.8 million after tax. There were no nonrecurring items in 2001. In fiscal 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to the 1998 dispositions of its cardiology businesses, recorded a charge for product line acquisitions, a net gain for legal settlements and asset dispositions and a charge for the writeoff of an option to acquire Endologix, Inc. The net after tax impact of these nonrecurring charges was $18.5 million. Goodwill amortization Fiscal 2001 included $12.3 million after tax goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2000 included $12.5 million after tax goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization is not required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 per FAS 142. Liquidity and Capital Resources Bards financial condition remains strong. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Bard increased its cash and short term investments to $383.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $271.0 million at December 31, 2001 and from $119.7 million at December 31, 2000. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. (dollars in millions) Fiscal Years 2002 2001 2000 Cash and short term investments $383.2 $271.0 $119.7 Working capital $441.1 $391.0 $302.1 Current ratio 2.39/1 2.40/1 2.35/1 Net cash position $230.1 $113.8 ($85.4) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash and short term investments less total debt. Cash and short term investments held in foreign currencies are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001.

Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities.

FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003.

For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Total debt 153.1 0.9 0.8 0.6 150.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases obligations 41.6 14.5 15.2 9.0 2.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 105.2 29.6 75.6 0.0 0.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 57.8 39.9 15.2 1.1 1.6 Other contractual obligations 6.2 5.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total contractual cash obligations $384.3 $110.9 $107.4 $10.7 $155.3 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt was $157.2 million at December 31, 2001, down from $205.1 million at December 31, 2000. These decreases were the result of improved operating cash flow. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002 and 16.6% at December 31, 2001. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments, including the recently announced agreement with Genyx Medical, Inc., involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. The payments reflected in the table assume all milestones are achieved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain product related milestones and various other favorable operational conditions. While it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect the companys best estimate. Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items were approximately $25.3 million in 2002, $44.7 million in 2001 and $68.6 million in 2000. These cash outlays were financed primarily with cash from operations. In 2003, the company will initiate a number of initiatives including implementation of an enterprise wide software platform, construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and construction or expansion of various manufacturing facilities. The company anticipates 2003 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70.0 to $80.0 million. The companys capital structure consists of equity and interest bearing debt. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities can also be used for other corporate purposes. In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300.0 million committed credit facility with a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May of 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that last matured in May of 2002. The 364 day committed credit facility was renewed during the second quarter of 2002 on substantially the same terms and matures in May of 2003. These facilities support the companys commercial paper program and carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees. There were no commercial paper borrowings during 2002. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2001 was approximately $57.5 million with an average outstanding balance of $31.2 million and an effective interest rate of 5.11%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either year end December 31, 2002 or 2001. Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market. On December 11, 2002 the companys Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the companys common stock. This new authorization follows the nearly completed buyback of 10.0 million shares authorized by the companys Board of Directors in July of 1998. The new shares along with the remaining 512,500 shares from the 1998 authorization will be acquired from time to time, consistent with past practice. Total shares purchased were 1,340,900 in 2002, 401,500 in 2001 and 420,300 in 2000. A total of 5,512,500 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorizations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("FAS 143"), which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The company adopted FAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and does not expect this statement to materially impact the companys financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). FAS 146 applies to costs associated with (a) certain termination benefits (so called one time termination benefits), (b) costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and (c) other associated costs including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The company adopted FAS 146 on January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved and announced to date; however, the pronouncement will im pact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements. Additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and annual financial statements, including a roll forward of the companys product warranty liabilities. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for Bard as of December 31, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Bard is in the process of assessing the impact of the recognition provisions of FIN 45 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure" ("FAS 148"). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, FAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for the companys fiscal year December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not expect FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. These requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the companys products upon shipment. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. A small percentage of the companys products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary, however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of the cha nge. In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. FAS 146 is effective Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) for the company as of January 1, 2003. FAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions. The company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions. These audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the companys tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expr essed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements f or procedures using the companys medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions (continued) product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components; economic factors that the company has no control over, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors that the company has no control over, including earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the companys restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements as circumsta nces change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the companys 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable, traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes. The company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Peso and the Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short term fluctuations in their equivalent United States dollar values. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming maturity, the market value of these notes was approximately $156.2 million at December 31, 2002.
