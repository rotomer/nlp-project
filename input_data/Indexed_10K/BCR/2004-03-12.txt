Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions Executive Overview C. R. Bard, Inc. is engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company markets its products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care health facilities and alternative site facilities in the United States and abroad, principally Europe and Japan. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and discarded. The company reports its results of operations around the concept of disease state management in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products. The company strives to have a leadership position in all of its products. Approximately 80% of the companys net sales in 2003 were derived from products in which the company has a number one or number two market leadership position. The companys revenues are generated from sales of the companys products, net of discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. The companys costs and expenses consist of costs of goods sold, marketing, selling and administrative expense, research and development expense, interest expense and other (income) expense, net. Costs of goods sold consist principally of the manufacturing and distribution costs of the companys products. Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the companys sales and administrative organizations. Research and development expense consists principally of expenses incurred with respect to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third party research and development activities and acquired in process research and development costs arising from the companys business development activities. Interest expense consists of interest charges on indebtedness. Other (income) expense, net consists principa lly of interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and other items, some of which may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. The companys margins and net income are driven by the companys ability to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. The companys ability to improve sales over time depends in part upon its ability to successfully develop and market new products. In this regard, the company has strategically increased funding of research and development activities, with a focus on products and markets that are growing faster than 8%. In 2003, the company spent approximately $87 million on research and development, an increase of approximately 40% from research and development spending of approximately $62 million in 2002. The company expects research and development spending to increase in 2004 as compared to 2003. In light of the complexity of the process of developing and bringing new products to market, the company expects a lag of as much as several years before the results of the increased research and development spending are reflected in increased net sales. In addition, there can be no ass urance that research and development activities will successfully generate new products at all or that new products will be successful. In a further effort to increase sales, the company has commenced an initiative to increase its sales force. In 2003, the company increased its U.S. sales force by approximately 10% and is currently considering further expansion in both the United States and Europe. The company also plans to generate increased sales through selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies. In general, the company focuses on small to medium size acquisitions of products and technologies that complement the companys existing product portfolio. In addition, the company may from time to time selectively consider acquisitions of larger, established companies under appropriate circumstances. The company has an extensive program of improving manufacturing efficiencies. As part of that program, in 2002 the company initiated the closure of two manufacturing facilities and two administrative offices in the United States and one manufacturing facility in Europe and the elimination of more than 600 positions. The companys program of improved manufacturing efficiency and its restructuring activities has resulted in sustained improvement of both margins and cash flow. Gross margins as a percentage of net sales improved by 3.2% in 2003 as compared to 2002. The improved cash flow associated with these activities provides additional funding for the companys research and development activities and other spending initiatives discussed above. The company has taken advantage of strong cash flow over the past several years to strengthen its balance sheet, reducing total debt to total capitalization from approximately 25% at the end of 2000 to less than 14% at the end of 2003. Working capital increased from approximately $302 million to approximately $453 million over the same period. The companys strong financial position further enables to company to pursue the strategic initiatives discussed above. Net Sales Bard reported 2003 consolidated net sales of $1,433.1 million, an increase of 13% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) over 2002 consolidated net sales of $1,273.8 million. Bards 2002 consolidated net sales increased 8% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) over consolidated net sales of $1,181.3 million in 2001. The geographic breakdown of net sales by the location of the external customer for each of the last three years is presented below: 2003 2002 2001 United States 71% 73% 73% Europe 18% 17% 17% Japan 5% 5% 5% Rest of world 6% 5% 5% Total net sales 100% 100% 100% The growth in consolidated net sales in 2003 was offset by a decrease of 0.1% as a result of price reductions compared to the prior year. The growth in consolidated net sales in 2002 included an increase of 0.7% as a result of price increases compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales were also affected by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing 2003 consolidated net sales by 3.3% as compared to the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing 2002 consolidated net sales by 0.7% as compared to the prior year. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the United States dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities. Bards 2003 United States net sales of $1,020.4 million increased 10% over 2002 United States net sales of $928.7 million. Bards 2003 international net sales of $412.7 million increased 20% on a reported basis (8% on a constant currency basis) over 2002 international net sales of $345.1 million. Bards 2002 United States net sales of $928.7 million increased 8% over 2001 United States net sales of $862.5 million. Bards 2002 international net sales of $345.1 million increased 8% on a reported basis (6% on a constant currency basis) over 2001 international net sales of $318.8 million. Presented below is a discussion of consolidated net sales by disease state for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Product Group Summary of Net Sales (dollars in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, As Reported As Reported 2003 2002 Change 2001 Change Vascular $307,300 $259,700 18% $250,900 4% Urology 451,500 419,700 8% 390,100 8% Oncology 336,300 299,000 12% 274,600 9% Surgery 272,300 229,500 19% 205,200 12% Other 65,700 65,900 60,500 9% Total net sales $1,433,100 $1,273,800 13% $1,181,300 8% Vascular Products Bard markets a wide range of products for the peripheral vascular market, including endovascular products, electrophysiology products and graft products. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of vascular products increased 18% on a reported basis (11% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2003 of vascular products grew 17% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2003 increased 19% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The vascular group is the companys most global business, with international net sales comprising 48% of consolidated net sales of vascular products in 2003. Endovascular products comprised 49% of 2003 consolidated net sales of vascular products. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of endovascular products increased 32% on a reported basis (23% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. New products such as the companys Conquest&trade; PTA balloon catheter, Fluency&trade; stent graft and Recovery&reg; vena cava filter contributed to the growth in this category. The company saw strong performance in 2003 from PTA catheter products, which grew over 63% on a reported basis (54% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The companys self expanding stent line, led by the companys innovative Luminexx&trade; stent, had notable performance in 2003, growing 36% on a reported basis (26% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The Recovery&reg; vena cava filter was the first of its kind in the United States. The product gives clinicians greater flexibility in the use of these filters because it can be removed percutaneously after the threat of blood clots traveling to the lungs has past. Joining the vascular product line in 2004 is the Vacora&trade; vacuum assisted biopsy device. This device will compete in the largest segment of the breast biopsy device market. Endovascular products comprised 44% of 2002 consolidated net sales of vascular products. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of endovascular products increased 12% on a reported basis (11% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2002, the companys consolidated net sales of self expanding stents grew 34% on a reported basis (31% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year, largely as a result of the introduction of a new 6 French Luminexx&trade; stent. In addition, the Conquest&trade; balloon powered the companys 2002 consolidated net sales of peripheral angioplasty products, which grew approximately 17% on a reported basis (15% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of electrophysiology products increased 9% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of electrophysiology products increased 2% on a reported basis ( 2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2002 of electrophysiology products grew 6% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2002 of electrophysiology products declined 2% on a reported basis ( 9% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2002, the companys electrophysiology business was slow to recover in Germany, where its dedicated sales force experienced high turnover associated with the companys proposed merger with Tyco International, Ltd., which was terminated in the first quarter of 2002. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of graft products increased 7% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2003 of graft products grew 7% compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of graft products declined 6% on a reported basis ( 6% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year due to the loss of a distribution agreement. Urology Products Bard markets a wide range of products for the urology market, including basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of urology products were $451.5 million, an increase of 8% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales of urology products represented 74% of consolidated net sales of urology products in 2003 and grew 5% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2003 of urology products increased 16% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of urology products were $419.7 million, an increase of 8% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.

International net sales in 2002 of urology products increased 10% on a reported basis (8% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of basic drainage products continues to provide a solid foundation to the companys urology business. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of basic drainage products increased 7% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of infection control products grew 13% on a reported basis (13% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. This growth demonstrates the companys ability to grow market share with the Bardex&reg; I.C. Foley catheters proven record for dramatically reducing urinary tract infections. This benefits both the patient and the hospital. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of basic drainage products of $261.8 million increased 7% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Primarily, infection control drainage products fueled this growth. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of urological specialties, which includes brachytherapy products and services, grew 8% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of brachytherapy products grew 11% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Brachytherapy is a form of prostate cancer treatment in which small radioactive seeds are implanted into the prostate gland to deliver low amounts of radiation over a period of time. The company believes the growth in brachytherapy product sales is favorable to the overall growth in the brachytherapy market. In 2003, the company acquired certain assets of several small brachytherapy distributors and manufacturers. See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The companys strategy is to be a consolidator in the brachytherapy business. 2002 consolidated net sales of urological specialties grew 6% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of brachytherapy products were the largest contributor to this increase, with 2002 consolidated net sales of these brachytherapy products growing 10% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Continence is the smallest category in urology products. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of continence products comprised 14% of consolidated net sales of urology products. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of continence products increased 8% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The companys surgical incontinence product line continues to provide the momentum in the continence category growing 41% on a reported basis (38% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of continence products grew 13% on a reported basis (12% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of surgical incontinence products grew over 61% on a reported basis (61% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.

Consolidated net sales in 2003 of oncology products grew 12% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2003 of oncology products grew 11% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2003 of oncology products grew 16% on a reported basis (6% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of oncology products grew 9% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2002 of oncology products increased 8% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2002 of oncology products grew 14% on a reported basis (12% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of specialty access products of $247.5 million comprised 74% of the oncology product group in 2003 and increased 20% on a reported basis (17% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2003 peripherally inserted central catheters ("PICCs") continue to be the fastest growing products in the specialty access category, growing approximately 34% on a reported basis (33% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. PICCs are catheters that are placed into a large vein in the arm and allows clinicians to access a patients central venous system primarily for administration of chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, intravenous fluids and blood sampling. The company continues to see the PICC market expand as these products are being used more frequently in place of intravenous catheters. In 2003, the company introduced its new Hemosplit&reg; dialysis access catheter with its proprietary split tip design. This catheter entered the market in mid year and has met with strong demand. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of dialysis catheters grew 32% on a reported basis (30% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of specialty access product of $206.2 comprised 69% of the oncology product group in 2002 and increased 12% on a reported basis (12% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2002, PICCs grew approximately 35% on a reported basis (35% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2002, the Dymax Site Rite&trade; product line grew 15% on a reported basis (15% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of gastrointestinal products were weak, declining 4% on a reported basis ( 6% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2003 of gastrointestinal products were weak in Europe due to the companys withdrawal from a distribution agreement with Olympus Optical Co. (Europa) GmbH. In 2002 consolidated net sales of gastrointestinal products grew 2% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Surgical Specialty Products Consolidated net sales in 2003 of surgical specialty products increased 19% on a reported basis (17% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.

Consolidated net sales in 2002 of surgical specialty products increased 12% on a reported basis (11% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2002 of surgical specialty products grew 12% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2002 of surgical specialty products grew 12% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The companys hernia repair product offerings comprised 70% of 2003 consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products. The companys ventral hernia repair franchise, led by the Ventralex&trade; and Composix&reg; Kugel&reg; products was the primary contributor to this categorys growth. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of hernia products grew 30% on a reported basis (27% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The companys hernia product offerings comprised 64% of 2002 consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of hernia products grew 26% on a reported basis (25% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The company launched the Ventralex&trade; hernia patch, a product designed specifically for umbilical hernias in the fourth quarter of 2002. Other Products The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain other equipment manufacturers ("OEM") products. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of other products were $65.7 million, approximately flat on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2002 of other products were $65.9 million, an increase of 9% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Costs and Expenses The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years shown: 2003 2002 2001 Cost of goods sold 42.5% 45.7% 46.6% Marketing, selling and administrative 31.3% 29.6% 30.8% Research and development expense 6.1% 4.8% 4.5% Interest expense 0.9% 1.0% 1.2% Other (income) expense, net 3.6% 2.3% (.4)% Total costs and expenses 84.4% 83.4% 82.7% Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 42.5%, a reduction of 3.2% from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 45.7%. The primary reason for this lower cost of goods sold was manufacturing efficiencies driven by higher production volumes and continual manufacturing cost improvement projects. Primarily due to continuing manufacturing cost improvements, the company expects its cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to continue to decline in 2004. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 45.7%, a reduction of 0.9% from cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 46.6%. The primary reason for this lower cost of goods sold was manufacturing efficiencies driven by higher production volumes and continual manufacturing cost improvement projects. Marketing, selling and administrative The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 31.3%, an increase of 1.7% from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 29.6%. Executive severance for two Bard managers negatively impacted the change in marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales by 0.4%, ongoing consulting studies related to sales coverage and deployment negatively impacted the change in marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales by 0.4% and legal expenses related to intellectual property and other commercial matters negatively impacted the change in marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales by 0.8%. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 29.6%, a reduction of 1.2% from the marketing, selli ng and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 30.8%. Marketing, selling and administrative expense in 2001 included goodwill amortization of $13.2 million pretax. Goodwill amortization is not required for years beginning after December 15, 2001 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") of Statements of Financial Accounting ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"("SFAS 142"). The elimination of goodwill amortization favorably impacted the improvement in marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales by 1.0% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Research and development expense Research and development expenses are comprised of expenses related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third party research and development activities and acquired in process research and development costs arising from the companys business development activities. The components of internal research and development expense include: salary and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and other costs. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. In 2003, costs to acquire in process research and development ("IPR&D") projects and technologies which have no alternate future use and which have not reached technological feasibility were recorded in research and development expense. Research and development expenditures in 2003 of $87.4 million represented a 41.7% increase over the prior years expenditures of $61.7 million. The fo llowing table presents the breakdown of the companys research and development expense: 2003 2002 2001 Internal research and development activities $78.8 $56.8 $53.4 Third party partner research and development milestones 7.6 4.9 Acquired in process research and development 1.0 Total research and development expense $87.4 $61.7 $53.4 Included in 2003 third party research and development milestones was a $3.0 million payment associated with the companys urethral bulking agent project. The urethral bulking agent project relates to the development of a second generation urethral bulking agent for stress incontinence. In addition, 2003 third party research and development milestones included $3.0 million associated with the companys PTA catheter development project. The PTA catheter development project relates to the development of several high pressure PTA balloon catheters. Research and development expenditures of $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 represented a 15.5% increase over the prior years expenditures of $53.4 million. Included in 2002 research and development expenditures was a third party partner research and development milestone payment of $3.5 million associated with the companys urethral bulking agent project and a third party partner research and development milestone payment related to the companys implantable pump project. Interest expense Interest expense in 2003 of $12.5 million was essentially unchanged from 2002 interest expense of $12.6 million. Interest expense in 2002 of $12.6 million decreased 11.3% over the prior years interest expense of $14.2 million, primarily as a result of lower debt balances. Other (income) expense, net The table below presents the components of other (income) expense, net for each of the three years ended December 31, 2003. (dollars in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Interest income $(6,600) $(6,500) $(6,200) Foreign exchange losses (gains) 1,000 (300) 1,100 Legal and patent settlements, net 54,500 (5,000) (1,200) Asset impairments 6,100 Divisional and manufacturing restructuring (2,500) 33,700 Merger termination costs (400) 6,200 Other, net 400 500 400 Total other (income) expense, net $52,500 $28,600 $(5,900) Legal and patent settlements, net In May 2002, the company was served with a complaint in an action entitled Nelson N. Stone, M.D., et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al., filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The action alleged that the company breached agreements with the plaintiffs by failing to use appropriate efforts to promote the growth of a business that the company purchased from the plaintiffs, thereby depriving the plaintiffs of additional consideration, failed to pay consideration due under the agreement, and induced the sale of the company by misrepresentation. On December 19, 2003, the jury returned a verdict in the plaintiffs favor with respect to certain of the plaintiffs claims and awarded the plaintiffs $58.0 million. Accordingly, the company recorded a charge of $58.0 million ($35.5 million after tax; $0.67 diluted earnings per share). The company recorded this charge in other (income) expense, net and the cor responding liability in accrued expenses. The company believes that the verdict is not supported by the evidence and that the amount of the award is grossly excessive. The company has filed post trial motions to set aside the verdict or reduce the amount of the award and for a new trial. The company expects these motions to be decided in the first half of 2004. If unsuccessful in these motions, the company will file an appeal. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the company reached a legal settlement on an intellectual property matter and recorded a pretax gain of $3.5 million ($2.1 million after tax; $0.04 diluted earnings per share). The company received the cash payment associated with this gain in the fourth quarter of 2003. In 2002, the company recorded a $5.0 million pretax gain ($3.0 million after tax; $0.06 diluted earnings per share) for the reversal of a legal accrual which had been established in 1998 in connection with a legal proceeding involving three former Bard employees. The matter was finally concluded by court order in the first quarter of 2002, and, accordingly, the accrual was reversed in that period. Asset impairments The majority of the $6.1 million fourth quarter 2003 charge for asset impairments ($3.6 million after tax; $0.07 diluted earnings per share) related to the companys pain management pump program. This program was administered internally with regard to marketing and sales and by a third party partner for manufacture and future product development. For 2003, the company recorded $0.1 million in net sales related to pain management pump products. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the company reassessed the pain management pump program and determined that the program was not meeting the companys strategic objectives. Based upon this reassessment, the company informed its partner of the companys termination of the development arrangement. The asset impairment charge related primarily to the write off of intangible and tangible assets associated with the pain management pump program. In addition to the pain management pump program impairment described above, the company recorded du ring the fourth quarter of 2003 an additional impairment charge for the assets of a minor product offering. This impairment was triggered by the rapidly declining sales and associated cash flows of this product. Divisional and manufacturing restructuring During the first and third quarters of 2002, based upon reviews of administrative, divisional and manufacturing operations, the companys management, with board approval, committed to certain initiatives to eliminate excess capacity, reduce redundant positions and improve product profitability. These initiatives included the exit from two manufacturing facilities in the United States, one manufacturing facility in Europe and two administrative offices in the United States by the end of 2003. A total of 617 manufacturing, manufacturing support and administrative positions were eliminated at these five locations and elsewhere. The manufacturing initiatives resulted in the consolidation of manufacturing operations into existing facilities in Mexico, Malaysia and the United States. The company accounted for these initiatives in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." In total, the company recorded pretax charges of $33.7 million ($20.7 million after tax; $0.39 diluted earnings per share) in other (income)/expense, net during 2002 ($9.1 million in the first quarter of 2002 and $24.6 million in the third quarter of 2002). These charges consisted of $19.8 million for termination benefits and $13.9 million for property, plant and equipment impairments, lease termination costs and idle facility costs. The termination benefit charge of $19.8 million consisted of severance payments and benefit continuation payments for 617 positions. These payments were made through 2003. The company recorded a charge of $8.1 million for the impairment of property, plant and equipment. This charge was determined based on the impaired assets net book value compared to their estimated fair market value, including estimated proceeds from disposal. The company recorded a charge of $2.3 million for the estimated present value of future non cancelable lease payments. This charge was estimated based upon the contractual terms of the agreements. The company believes that due to current market conditions sublease revenues are unlikely. The company will attempt to sell the closed facilities and either redeploy or dispose of the associated assets. The company recorded a charge of $3.5 million for idle facility costs for committed operating expenses which will be incurred after the closed facilities cease production but prior to di sposition. Through December 31, 2003, the company has eliminated 593 positions and closed all five facilities. The table below summarizes the 2002 restructuring charges and associated accruals for the two years ended December 31, 2003. (dollars in thousands) Beginning Balance Cash Paid Non cash Charges 12/31/02 Accrual Cash Paid Adjust ments 12/31/03 Accrual Restructuring provisions Termination benefits $19,800 ($8,200) $11,600 ($6,800) ($2,500) $2,300 Property, plant and equipment impairment 8,100 (8,100) Lease termination 2,300 2,300 (500) (200) 1,600 Idle facility costs 3,500 (300) 3,200 (1,200) (1,500) 500 Total restructuring provisions $33,700 ($8,200) ($8,400) $17,100 ($8,500) ($4,200) $4,400 The 2003 accrual reduction of $4.2 million was offset by incremental expense related to the shortfall in the estimated proceeds for the closed manufacturing facilities of approximately $1.7 million. The net adjustment to 2002 divisional and manufacturing restructuring was a $2.5 million pretax gain ($1.6 million after tax; $0.03 diluted earnings per share) recorded in other (income) expense, net. The pretax operating savings resulting from the companys restructuring activities are integral to the companys overall program of continual manufacturing improvement. Savings are primarily realized through reduced salary expense and greater productivity. In 2002, the company achieved incremental pretax operating savings of approximately $6.9 million from restructuring activities and the companys ongoing program of continual manufacturing improvement (approximately $3.7 million in cost of goods sold and approximately $3.2 million in selling, general and administrative expense). These 2002 savings were offset by approximately $1.0 million of pretax transition costs. In 2003, the company achieved overall incremental pretax operating savings of approximately $36.0 million from restructuring activities and the companys ongoing program of continual manufacturing improvement (approximately $33.2 million in cost of goods sold and approximately $2.8 million in selling, general and administrative expense). Thes e 2003 savings were offset by approximately $5.2 million of pretax transition costs. In 2004, the company estimates incremental pretax operating savings of approximately $10.5 million from restructuring activities and the companys ongoing program of continual manufacturing improvement (approximately $10.5 million in cost of goods sold ). Incremental improvements in the companys operating cash flow have approximated the improvement in the companys pretax operating savings. Merger termination costs On May 29, 2001, Bard entered into an agreement that provided for the merger of Bard with a subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco Merger Agreement"). On February 6, 2002, Bard and Tyco agreed to terminate this agreement. Each company agreed to bear its own costs and expenses. Neither company paid a break up fee. In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded a pretax charge of $6.2 million ($4.0 million after tax; $0.08 diluted earnings per share) associated with the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the company reversed the remaining accruals for termination costs and recorded a pretax gain of $0.4 million ($0.2 million after tax). Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2003 2002 2001 U.S. federal statutory rate 35% 35% 35% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1% 2% 3% Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (11%) (11)% (9)% Other, net 1% 1% Effective tax rate 25% 27% 30% The 2% reduction in the companys effective tax rate between 2003 and 2002 is primarily attributable to the impact of the jury verdict in the action entitled Nelson N. Stone, M.D., et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al., discussed above. The 3.0% reduction in the companys effective tax rate between 2002 and 2001 is primarily attributable to the receipt during 2002 of a new tax grant at a lower rate for the companys Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and the elimination of goodwill amortization per SFAS 142. The companys goodwill amortization was primarily nontax deductible. The lower Puerto Rico grant rate was retroactively applied to the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 and, accordingly, a $3.5 million tax credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this grant. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2003 consolidated net income of $168.5 million, an increase of 9% over 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million. Bard reported 2003 diluted earnings per share of $3.20, an increase of 9% over 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94. Bard reported 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million, an increase of 8% over 2001 consolidated net income of $143.2 million. Bard reported 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.94, an increase of 7% over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.75. As described above under "Other (income) expense, net" certain events in 2003, 2002 and 2001 impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, investments in businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Cash $29.0 $23.1 $30.8 Cash equivalents 388.4 350.6 231.5 Short term investments 4.6 9.5 8.7 Subtotal $422.0 $383.2 $271.0 Working capital $453.2 $441.1 $391.0 Current ratio 2.07/1 2.39/1 2.40/1 Net cash position $253.9 $230.1 $113.8 Short term investments that have original maturities of ninety days or less are considered cash equivalents. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash, cash equivalents and short term investments less total debt. Substantially all of the companys cash equivalents and short term investments are held by wholly or majority owned foreign subsidiaries and are invested in highly rated, liquid investments including time deposits and money funds. Should it be necessary, these investments could be repatriated back to the United States resulting in additional United States income taxes. The company believes that domestic cash needs can be satisfied with domestic operating cash flows and additional borrowings if required. The following table provides cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by operating activities $262.8 $261.3 $256.7 Net cash used in investing activities ($184.8) ($54.1) ($72.1) Net cash used in financing activities ($55.1) ($103.7) ($33.8) Operating activities During 2003, the company generated $262.8 million cash flow from operations, $1.5 million more than the cash flow from operations reported in 2002. During 2002, the company generated $261.3 million cash flow from operations, $4.6 million more than the $256.7 million cash flow from operations reported in 2001. In 2003, net income of $168.5 million increased $13.5 million over net income reported in 2002. In 2002, net income of $155.0 million increased $11.8 million over net income reported in 2002. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $94.3 million, $106.3 million and $113.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Depreciation expense was approximately $29.9 million in 2003, $27.7 million in 2002 and $26.2 million in 2001. Amortization expense was approximately $14.8 million in 2003, $14.6 million in 2002 and $27.0 million in 2001. Included in 2001 amortization expense wa s $13.2 million of amortization expense on goodwill. The amortization of goodwill is no longer required per SFAS 142. Investing activities During 2003, the company used $184.8 million in cash for investing activities, $130.7 million more than investing activities reported in 2002. During 2002, the company used $54.1 million in cash for investing activities, $18.0 million less than the $72.1 million use of cash for investing activities reported in 2001. Capital expenditures amounted to $72.1 million, $41.0 million and $27.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 capital expenditures was principally for the ongoing implementation of the companys enterprise wide software platform, the construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and expansions at several manufacturing facilities. The company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $80.0 million in 2004 as additional investments will be made in information technology systems and manufacturing facilities. The company spent approximately $114.2 million in 2003, $13.1 million in 2002 and $44.7 million in 2001 for the acquisition of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items to augment its existing product lines. These cash expenditures were financed primarily with cash from operations and short term borrowings. Financing activities During 2003, the company used $55.1 million in cash for financing activities, $48.6 million less than financing activities reported in 2002. During 2002, the company used $103.7 million in cash for financing activities, $69.9 million more than the $33.8 million use of cash for financing activities reported in 2001. Cash flow related to financing activities included changes in borrowings, equity proceeds related to option exercises, purchases of company stock and dividend payments. Total debt was $168.1 million, $153.1 million and $157.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in total debt in 2003 was primarily the result of purchases of businesses and technologies and increased capital spending and was financed with commercial paper. Total debt to total capitalization was 13.8%, 14.8% and 16.6% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. On December 11, 2002, the companys Board of Directors approved th e purchase of an additional 5,000,000 shares of the companys common stock. In 2003, the company spent approximately $59.4 million to purchase 886,700 shares under this new authorization and the completed 10,000,000 share authorization previously approved by the Board of Directors in July 1998. In 2002, 1,340,900 shares were purchased. In 2001, 401,500 shares were purchased. At December 31, 2003, a total of 4,625,800 shares remain under the companys share purchase authorization. The company paid cash dividends of $0.90 per share in 2003, $0.86 per share in 2002 and $0.84 per share in 2002. The 2003 payment marked the 32nd consecutive calendar year in which Bard has increased its annual dividend payout to shareholders. The company maintains a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities that support the companys commercial paper program. The committed facilities may also be used for other corporate purposes. The company maintains a $200.0 million five year committed credit facility that matures in May 2005 and a $100.0 million 364 day committed credit facility that matures in May 2004. Interest rates and facility fees on these credit arrangements are determined by a pricing grid based on the companys long term credit ratings. These facilities do not require compensating balances. At December 31, 2003, outstanding commercial paper totaled $15.7 million. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2003 was approximately $54.0 million with an average outstanding balance of $28.9 million and an effective interest rate of 1.12%. There were no commercial paper borrowings at either December 31, 2002 or December 31, 2001. Certain of the companys debt agreements contain customary representations, war ranties and default provisions as well as restrictions that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum net worth and operating cash flow levels and limit the amount of debt that the company may have outstanding. As of December 31, 2003, the company was in compliance with all such covenants. The company has $150.0 million of unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2003. The notes mature in 2026 and pay a semi annual coupon of 6.70%. The coupon interest closely approximates the effective annual cost of the notes. The 6.70% notes due 2026 may be redeemed at the option of the note holder on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming these notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes approximates $166.4 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, the companys long term debt was rated "BBB+" by Standard and Poors and "Baa2" by Moodys and the companys commercial paper ratings were "A 2" by Standard and Poors and "P 2" by Moodys. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (dollars in millions) Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Forward currency agreements $20.3 $20.3 Total debt 168.1 16.6 $0.7 $0.8 $150.0 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 Operating leases obligations 48.0 16.7 18.5 10.2 2.6 Acquisition and investment milestones 99.4 29.0 69.9 0.5 Unconditional purchase obligations 61.2 44.1 15.0 1.0 1.1 Other contractual obligations 19.7 16.9 2.1 0.6 0.1 Total contractual cash obligations $416.8 $143.7 $106.2 $13.1 $153.8 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward currency agreements and purchases put options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, the majority of these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $168.1 million at December 31, 2003, up $15.0 million from December 31, 2002. Total debt was $153.1 million at December 31, 2002, down $4.1 million from December 31, 2001. Total debt to total capitalization was 13.8% at December 31, 2003. Total debt to total capitalization was 14.8% at December 31, 2002. Leases The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones The company enters into various acquisition and investment arrangements, including research and development arrangements, product and intellectual property acquisitions and business combinations. In connection with some of these activities the company agrees to make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets. Such payments, when made, are allocated to specific intangible asset categories, assigned to excess of cost over net assets acquired or charged to research and development, depending on the nature of the arrangement. The most significant of these arrangements are described below and assume all milestones will be achieved and payments made. Payments Due by Period (dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Urethral Bulking Agent Project $53.5 $53.5 Vacora&trade; Vacuum Assisted Biopsy Device 20.5 $ 10.0 10.5 PTA Catheter Development Project 17.3 15.3 2.0 All other under $6 million 8.1 3.7 3.9 $0.5 Total $99.4 $29.0 $69.9 $0.5 The Urethral Bulking Agent Project relates to the development of a second generation urethral bulking agent for stress incontinence by a third party partner. The agreement provides the company with an option to enter an asset purchase and licensing agreement contingent upon the third party partner achieving FDA approval for the bulking agent. The company anticipates that the $53.5 million will be recorded as an intangible asset. Due to the contingent nature of this milestone, management is unable to assess the likelihood of this milestone being achieved. The company has estimated the possible timing of the milestone and the related payment. During the second quarter of 2003, the company recorded $3.0 million as a research and development expense related to the achievement of a milestone for this project. Vacora&trade; Vacuum Assisted Biopsy Device milestones related to the companys acquisition of the intellectual property assets related to this product in the third quarter of 2003. Included in the companys acquisition of these assets were two anniversary payments for $10.0 million and $10.5 million payable in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The company has recorded these anniversary payments as patents with corresponding liabilities in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities. The PTA Catheter Development Project relates to the development of several high pressure, PTA balloon catheters. The milestones relate primarily to intangible assets. Due to the contingent nature of these milestones, management is unable to assess the likelihood of these milestones being achieved. The company has estimated the possible timing of these milestones and related payments. Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to project related commitments. Pension Obligations The companys objective in funding its domestic tax qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also take into account each tax qualified plans return compared to the plans corresponding expense and the extent to which each tax qualified plans accumulated benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status. In 2003, the company made voluntary contributions in excess of the targets discussed above of $10.0 million to the companys U.S. tax qualified plan and $7.7 million to the companys U.K. tax qualified plans. In 2002, the company made voluntary contributions in excess of the targets discussed above of $38.0 million to the companys U.S. tax qualified plan. The company will consider the factors identified above in determining its 2004 pension funding. The nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans include supplemental plans which are generally not funded. Guarantees In connection with the December 2003 Nelson N. Stone, M.D., et al. v. C.R. Bard, Inc., et al. jury verdict, in February 2004, the company posted a $64.4 million supersedeas bond as it pursues post trial motions. As required by the court, the bonded amount is 111% of the amount of the judgement. The company does not expect any potential payment related to this judgment to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally provided by SFAS 123. Additionally, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transitional requirements of SFAS 148 are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The company adopted the disclosure portion of this statement beginning in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. The application of the disclosure portion of this standard had no impact on the companys consolidated financial position or results of op erations. On April 22, 2003, the FASB determined that stock based compensation should be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair value of stock options. The FASB has not as yet determined the methodology for calculating fair value and plans to issue an exposure draft and final statement in 2004. The company will continue to monitor communications on this subject from the FASB in order to determine the impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46R") which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights, and accordingly whether it should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003. The company is required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in variable interest entities ("VIEs") for the first period ended after March 15, 2004. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an acc ounting change. If determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair market value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the VIE. The company is evaluating the impact of applying FIN 46R to existing arrangements and has not completed this analysis. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS No. 150"). SFAS No. 150 provides guidance on how an entity classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. Managements Use of Non GAAP Measures The companys management analyzes net sales on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales, the companys management believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The calculation of growth rates on a constant currency basis is a non GAAP measure and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to sales growth calculated on a reported or GAAP basis. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for "critical accounting policies". The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particu lar transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates, when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Unless agreed otherwise, the companys terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss passes F.O.B. origin. Certain sales to domestic and European distributors are F.O.B. destination. For arrangements where the companys terms state F.O.B. destination, the company records sales on this basis. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out ("LIFO") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out ("FIFO") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Restructuring cost estimates As a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization, the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate employees, terminate leases, writedown assets or close duplicative facilities. Currently, these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges". As additional information becomes available in future periods, the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information. The company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary however, if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in the period of t he change. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94 3. This pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS 146 is effective for the company as of January 1, 2003. SFAS 146 will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date; however, the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after January 1, 2003. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the U.S and outside the U.S. The company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. Such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. The companys United States federal tax filings have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for calendar years ending prior to 1996. All differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. The company is currently under examination by the IRS for the 1996 through 1999 calendar years. In addition, Inland Revenue in the U.K. is conducting an audit for the 1996 through 2001 tax years. Management believes that the company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities. These positions relate to, among others, the allocation and or recognition of income on intercompany transactions, the timing and amount of deductions and the tax treatment related to acquisitions and divestitures. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on the companys financial condition or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a reporting period. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such re bate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Valuation of IPR&D, Goodwill and Intangible Assets When the company acquires another company, the purchase price is allocated, as applicable, between in process research and development ("IPR&D"), other identifiable intangible assets, tangible assets, and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. IPR&D is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. F or IPR&D, these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including IPR&D, of the acquired businesses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists. The test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The company estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the companys consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Intangible assets consist primarily of patents, distribution agreements and other intellectual property, which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 8 to 19 years. The company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of event suggest the remaining value is not recoverable. Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Mexican Peso and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming these notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes approximates $166.4 million at December 31, 2003.
