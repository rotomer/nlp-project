Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The company is engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company markets its products to hospitals, individual health care professionals, extended care health facilities and alternative site facilities in the United States and abroad, principally in Europe and Japan. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and discarded or implanted either temporarily or permanently. The company reports its results of operations around the concept of disease state management in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products. The company strives to have a leadership position in all of its markets. Approximately 79% of the companys ongoing net sales in 2004 were derived from products in which the company has a number one or number two market leadership position. See the Net Sales discussion below for an explanation of ongoing net sales. The companys key growth initiatives include additional focus on research and development, the expansion of its sales organization, business development activities and improved manufacturing efficiencies. The companys margins and net income are driven by the companys ability to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. The companys ability to improve sales over time depends in part upon its success in developing and marketing new products. In this regard, the company has strategically increased funding of research and development activities, with a focus on products and markets that are growing faster than 8%. In 2004, the company spent approximately $111.6 million on research and development, an increase of approximately 27.7% from research and development spending of approximately $87.4 million in 2003. The company expects research and development spending to increase in 2005 as compared to 2004. In light of the complexity of the process of developing and bringing new products to market, the company expects a lag of as much as several years before the results of increased research and development spending are reflected in increased net sales. In addition, there can be no assurance that research and development activities will successfully generate new products or that new products will be successful. In 2003, as part of its effort to generate increased sales, the company increased its U.S. sales force by approximately 50 sales representatives. In the third quarter of 2004, the company began a further sales force expansion to increase its U.S. sales force by approximately 60 sales representatives and to increase its international sales force, primarily in Europe, by approximately 40 sales representatives. The company believes that its sales force expansions enhance geographic coverage, increase focus on high growth businesses, facilitate new product introductions and aid in the identification of new product opportunities at the call point level. The company also plans to generate increased sales through selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies. In general, the company focuses on small to medium size acquisitions of products and technologies that complement the companys existing product portfolio. In addition, the company may from time to time selectively consider acquisitions of larger, established companies under appropriate circumstances. From time to time, the company may divest lines of business in which the company is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position or for other strategic reasons. For a discussion of acquisitions and dispositions which the company completed during 2004 and 2003, see the information in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report. The company has a comprehensive program aimed at improving manufacturing efficiencies. This program has built on the companys past restructuring activities and has resulted in sustained improvement of both margins and cash flow. Gross margins as a percentage of net sales improved by 260 basis points in 2004 as compared to 2003. The improved cash flow associated with these activities provides additional funding for the companys research and development activities and other growth initiatives discussed above. II 3 The company has taken advantage of strong cash flow over the past several years to strengthen its balance sheet, reducing total debt to total capitalization from approximately 17% at the end of 2001 to 10% at the end of 2004. Working capital increased from approximately $391 million to approximately $664 million over the same period. The companys strong financial position further enables the company to pursue the growth initiatives discussed above. Results of Operations Net Sales The companys revenues are generated from sales of the companys products, net of discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. Bard reported 2004 consolidated net sales of $1,656.1 million, an increase of 16% on a reported basis over 2003 consolidated net sales of $1,433.1 million. Bards 2003 consolidated net sales increased 13% on a reported basis over consolidated net sales of $1,273.8 million in 2002. The geographic breakdown of net sales by the location of the third party customer for each of the last three years is presented below: 2004 2003 2002 United States 70 % 71 % 73 % Europe 19 % 18 % 17 % Japan 5 % 5 % 5 % Rest of world 6 % 6 % 5 % Total net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % The growth in consolidated net sales in 2004 was offset by a decrease of 0.4% as a result of price reductions compared to the prior year. The growth in consolidated net sales in 2003 included a decrease of 0.1% as a result of price reductions compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales were also affected by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing 2004 consolidated net sales by 2.6% as compared to the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing 2003 consolidated net sales by 3.3% as compared to the prior year. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the United States dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities. Bards 2004 United States net sales of $1,156.2 million increased 13% over 2003 United States net sales of $1,020.4 million. Bards 2004 international net sales of $499.9 million increased 21% on a reported basis (12% on a constant currency basis) over 2003 international net sales of $412.7 million. Bards 2003 United States net sales of $1,020.4 million increased 10% over 2002 United States net sales of $928.7 million. Bards 2003 international net sales of $412.7 million increased 20% on a reported basis (8% on a constant currency basis) over 2002 international net sales of $345.1 million.

Consolidated net sales in 2004 of vascular products increased 28% on a reported basis (23% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2004 of vascular products grew 31% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2004 increased 25% on a reported basis (15% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The vascular group is the companys most global business, with international net sales comprising 47% of consolidated net sales of vascular products in 2004. Endovascular products comprised 56% of 2004 consolidated net sales of vascular products. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of endovascular products increased 47% on a reported basis (40% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Due to the continued strong performance of the Conquest PTA balloon catheter, the company saw strong performance in 2004 from percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheter products, the net sales of which grew 55% on a reported basis (50% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The companys self expanding stent line had notable performance in 2004, with net sales growing 56% on a reported basis (48% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year with a strong contribution from the ePTFE encapsulated Fluency&reg; stent graft. Net sales of the vena cava filter category grew 88% on a reported basis (87% on a constant currency basis) in 2004 as compared to the prior year, driven by sales of the Recovery&reg; vena cava filter. The Vacora vacuum assisted biopsy device continued to gain momentum in 2004, fueling growth in the biopsy category. The company is driving growth through the combination of Vacoras unique features and benefits, the companys leadership presence in the core needle market and the increased call point focus of the companys biopsy business unit. Endovascular products comprised 49% of 2003 consolidated net sales of vascular products. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of endovascular products increased 32% on a reported basis (23% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Products such as the companys Conquest PTA balloon catheter, Fluency&reg; stent graft, Luminexx&reg; stent, and Recovery&reg; vena cava filter contributed to the growth in this category. The company saw strong performance in 2003 from PTA catheter products, the net sales of which grew over 63% on a reported basis (54% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The companys self expanding stent line grew 36% in 2003 on a reported basis (26% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The Recovery&reg; vena cava filter was approved for use as a removable device starting in mid 2003, giving clinicians greater flexibility in the use of these filters. II 5 Consolidated net sales in 2004 of electrophysiology products increased 8% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of electrophysiology products increased 9% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.

United States net sales in 2004 of graft products grew 8% compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of graft products increased 7% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2003 of graft products grew 7% compared to the prior year. Urology Products Bard markets a wide range of products for the urology market, including basic drainage products, incontinence products and urological specialty products. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of urology products were $493.1 million, an increase of 9% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales of urology products represented 72% of consolidated net sales of urology products in 2004 and grew 7% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2004 of urology products increased 16% on a reported basis (8% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of urology products were $451.5 million, an increase of 8% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales of urology products represented 74% of consolidated net sales of urology products in 2003 and grew 5% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2003 of urology products increased 16% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Basic drainage products continue to provide a solid foundation for the companys urology business. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of basic drainage products increased 9% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of infection control products grew 17% on a reported and on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. This growth demonstrates the companys ability to increase market share with the Bardex&reg; I.C. Foley catheters proven record for reducing urinary tract infections. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of basic drainage products increased 7% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of infection control products grew 13% on a reported and on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of urological specialties, which includes brachytherapy products and services, grew 6% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of brachytherapy products grew 3% on a reported and on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Brachytherapy is a form of prostate cancer treatment in which small radioactive seeds are implanted into the prostate gland to deliver low amounts of radiation over a period of time. The company believes its growth in brachytherapy product sales is favorable to the overall growth in the brachytherapy market. In 2003, the company acquired certain assets of several small brachytherapy distributors and a seed manufacturer. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of urological specialties grew 8% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of brachytherapy products grew 11% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of continence products comprised 14% of consolidated net sales of urology products. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of incontinence products increased 17% on a reported basis (13% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The companys surgical incontinence product line continues to provide the momentum in the continence category, with net sales growing 44% on a reported basis (41% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The companys Pelvilace Transvaginal Tape sling and Pelvisoft&reg; biomesh product for pelvic floor repair were strong contributors. The companys growth in the female incontinence and vaginal prolapse markets has been offset in part by continued weakness in the Contigen&reg; II 6 collagen implant product line. The anticipated introduction of the new Tegress product in 2005, as a result of the companys acquisition of certain assets of Genyx Medical, Inc. in January 2005, will allow the company to offer an additional tissue bulking treatment alternative and further strengthen Bards broad offering of both surgical and less invasive incontinence solutions. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of continence products increased 8% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Oncology Products The companys oncology products include specialty access products used primarily for chemotherapy. On September 30, 2004, the company sold certain assets of its Endoscopic Technologies Division to ConMed. Net sales of the disposed and other endoscopic devices are reported in Oncology Products. The company uses ongoing net sales to refer to net sales excluding the net sales of the products that were sold to ConMed. Consolidated ongoing net sales in 2004 of oncology products grew 21% on a reported basis (19% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States ongoing net sales in 2004 of oncology products grew 22% compared to the prior year. International ongoing net sales in 2004 of oncology products grew 20% on a reported basis (12% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated ongoing net sales in 2003 of oncology products grew 19% on a reported basis (16% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States ongoing net sales in 2003 of oncology products grew 16% compared to the prior year. International ongoing net sales in 2003 of oncology products grew 27% on a reported basis (14% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of specialty access products of $304.9 million comprised 78% of the oncology product group in 2004 and increased 23% on a reported basis (21% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2004, PICCs continue to be the fastest growing products in the specialty access category, with net sales growing 34% on a reported basis (33% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. PICCs are catheters that are placed into a large vein in the arm, allowing clinicians to access a patients central venous system for administration of chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, intravenous fluids and blood sampling. Contributing to the strong performance in the PICC category in 2004 was the first quarter introduction of the new PowerPICC which allows for the injection of contrast media for CT (contrast enhanced computed tomography) scans, eliminating the need to place an additional catheter. The company continues to see the PICC market expand as these products are being used more frequently in place of intravenous catheters. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of dialysis catheters grew 32% on a reported basis (31% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of specialty access products of $247.5 million comprised 74% of the oncology product group in 2003 and increased 20% on a reported basis (17% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2003, PICCs were the fastest growing products in the specialty access category, growing 34% on a reported basis (33% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2003, the company introduced its new Hemosplit&reg; dialysis access catheter with its proprietary split tip design. This catheter entered the market in mid year and was met with strong demand. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of dialysis catheters grew 32% on a reported basis (30% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The enteral feeding devices and other products that remain in the ongoing oncology category following the sale of certain endoscopic products to ConMed totaled $37.9 million and $35.2 million and grew 8% and 11% for the years ended 2004 and 2003, respectively, in each case compared to the prior year. Surgical Specialty Products Consolidated net sales in 2004 of surgical specialty products increased 15% on a reported basis (14% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2004 of surgical specialty products increased 12% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2004 of surgical specialty products increased 26% on a reported basis (18% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of surgical specialty products increased 19% on a reported basis (17% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. United States net sales in 2003 of surgical specialty products increased 16% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2003 of surgical specialty products increased 32% on a reported basis (20% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. II 7 The companys hernia repair product offerings comprised 71% of 2004 consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products. The companys ventral hernia repair franchise, led by the Ventralex and Composix&reg; Kugel&reg; products, was the primary contributor to this categorys growth. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of hernia products grew 18% on a reported basis (16% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Sales of groin hernia repair products, including the companys proprietary Perfix&reg; Plug and Kugel&reg; patch, continue to grow faster than the market. Also contributing to the growth in the surgical specialties category was the companys acquisition of the new Salute&reg; fixation system from Onux Medical, Inc. in mid 2004. The Salute&reg; device is used to attach hernia repair products to host tissue in laproscopic procedures. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of hernia products grew 30% on a reported basis (27% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. In 2003, the companys hernia product offerings comprised 70% of consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products. Other Products The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain other equipment manufacturers products. Consolidated net sales in 2004 of other products were $67.8 million, an increase of 3% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2003 of other products were $65.7 million, approximately flat on a reported basis ( 1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Costs and Expenses The companys costs and expenses consist of costs of goods sold, marketing, selling and administrative expense, research and development expense, interest expense and other (income) expense, net. Costs of goods sold consist principally of the manufacturing and distribution costs of the companys products. Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the companys sales and administrative organizations. Research and development expense consists principally of expenses incurred with respect to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third party research and development activities and acquired in process research and development costs (IPR&D) arising from the companys business development activities. Interest expense consists of interest charges on indebtedness. Other (income) expense, net consists principally of interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and other items, some of which may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years shown: 2004 2003 2002 Cost of goods sold 39.9 % 42.5 % 45.7 % Marketing, selling and administrative 31.5 % 31.3 % 29.6 % Research and development expense 6.7 % 6.1 % 4.8 % Interest expense 0.8 % 0.9 % 1.0 % Other (income) expense, net (3.9 )% 3.6 % 2.3 % Total costs and expenses 75.0 % 84.4 % 83.4 % Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 39.9%, a reduction of 260 basis points from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 of 42.5%. As in the prior year, the primary reason for this lower cost of goods sold was manufacturing efficiencies driven by higher production volumes and continuous manufacturing cost improvement projects. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 42.5%, a reduction of 320 basis points from cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 45.7%. Marketing, selling and administrative The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 31.5%, an increase of 20 basis points from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 of 31.3%. The primary factors in the increased percentage were higher payments under sales compensation plans, the incremental effect of the II 8 companys sales expansion program and increased spending related to the companys compliance with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 31.3%, an increase of 170 basis points from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 29.6%. Executive severance negatively impacted the change in marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales by 40 basis points, ongoing consulting studies related to sales coverage and deployment negatively impacted the change in marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales by 40 basis points and legal expenses related to intellectual property and other commercial matters negatively impacted the change in marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales by 80 basis points. Research and development expense Research and development expenses are comprised of expenses related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third party research and development activities and acquired IPR&D costs arising from the companys business development activities. The components of internal research and development expense include: salary and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and milestone payments for third party research and development. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The following table presents the breakdown of the companys research and development expense: 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Internally managed research and development $ 104.9 $ 86.4 $ 61.7 Acquired in process research and development 6.7 1.0 Total research and development expense $ 111.6 $ 87.4 $ 61.7 Research and development expenditures in 2004 of $111.6 million represented a 27.7% increase over the prior years expenditures of $87.4 million. The company has strategically increased funding of research and development activities, with a focus on products and markets that are growing faster than 8%. The company has entered into one product development arrangement resulting in a variable interest entity for which Bard is the primary beneficiary. This arrangement requires consolidation under the provisions of revised Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). For the full year ended December 31, 2004, the company recorded approximately $1.5 million in research and development expense and a corresponding credit in other (income) expense, net for the noncontrolling interest related to this arrangement. For the full year ended December 31, 2004, the company recorded IPR&D expense of $6.7 million related to the acquisition of the assets of Onux, Inc. and the stock of Bridger Biomed, Inc. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Research and development expenditures of $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 represented a 41.7% increase over the prior years expenditures of $61.7 million. Included in 2003 internally managed research and development was a $3.0 million payment to Genyx Medical, Inc. related to the development of a second generation urethral bulking agent for stress incontinence. In addition, 2003 internally managed research and development included a $3.0 million payment associated with the companys PTA catheter development project. The PTA catheter development project relates to the development of several high pressure PTA balloon catheters. For the full year ended December 31, 2003, the company recorded IPR&D expense of $1.0 million related to the acquisition of the assets of Source Tech Medical, LLC.

Interest expense Interest expense in 2004 was $12.7 million as compared with 2003 interest expense of $12.5 million and 2002 interest expense of $12.6 million. II 9 Other (income) expense, net The table below presents the components of other (income) expense, net for each of the three years ended December 31. 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in thousands) Interest income $ (8,400 ) $ (6,600 ) $ (6,500 ) Foreign exchange losses (gains) 900 1,000 (300 ) Gain on Endoscopic Technologies asset divestiture (45,500 ) Legal settlements, net (1,600 ) 54,500 (5,000 ) Investment gain (6,200 ) Asset impairments 6,100 Divisional and manufacturing restructuring (2,700 ) (2,500 ) 33,700 Merger termination costs (400 ) 6,200 Noncontrolling interest (1,500 ) Other, net 1,300 400 500 Total other (income) expense, net $ (63,700 ) $ 52,500 $ 28,600 Gain on Endoscopic Technologies asset divestiture Consistent with the companys stated intention to divest from time to time lines of business in which the company is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position, the company sold certain assets of its Endoscopic Technologies Division to ConMed for $81.3 million on September 30, 2004 including a post closing adjustment. The products associated with this sale are used primarily by gastroenterologists for endoscopic procedures. Significant assets of the Endoscopic Technologies Division were retained by the company. Net sales associated with the divested assets were $46 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004 and approximately $54 million in 2003. The company did not separately track the pretax profitability of the disposed assets due to the companys shared corporate infrastructure and the integration of the disposed assets with assets remaining with the company. A summary of the book value of the disposed assets is as follows: (dollars in millions) Inventories $ 11.6 Machinery and equipment, net of depreciation $ 3.7 Intangible assets, net of amortization $ 3.9 Assumed liabilities $ 2.6 As a result of the sale, the company recorded a pretax gain of $45.5 million in other (income) expense, net ($31.1 million after tax) in 2004. Legal settlements, net In the first quarter of 2004, the company settled certain commercial litigation related to the companys brachytherapy business and reversed $16.0 million ($9.8 million after tax) of a $58.0 million pretax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to this litigation. In addition, during the first quarter of 2004, the company recorded a $3.9 million pretax charge for an unrelated legal settlement ($2.3 million after tax). In the second quarter of 2004, the company settled an intellectual property dispute related to certain of the companys laparoscopic irrigators and recorded a pretax charge of $10.5 million ($6.3 million after tax). In the fourth quarter of 2003, the company recorded a pretax charge of $58.0 million ($35.5 million after tax) for certain commercial litigation related to the companys brachytherapy business. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the company reached a settlement on an intellectual property matter and recorded a pretax gain of $3.5 million ($2.1 million after tax). In 2002, the company recorded a $5.0 million pretax gain ($3.0 million after tax) for the reversal of a legal accrual which had been established in 1998 in connection with a legal proceeding involving three former Bard employees. The matter was finally concluded by court order in the first quarter of 2002, and, accordingly, the accrual was reversed in that period. II 10 Investment gain On April 23, 2004, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. announced that it had completed its acquisition of privately held Implex Corp. (Implex) for $98.6 million in cash. Bard held Implex shares at a zero basis and accordingly recorded a $6.2 million pretax gain ($3.7 million after tax) arising from the companys cash proceeds associated with this transaction during the second quarter of 2004 . Pursuant to the Implex acquisition agreement, the company may also receive periodic contingent milestone payments based upon performance. In January of 2005, Bard received $3.2 million related to an Implex milestone payment which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2005. Asset impairments The majority of the $6.1 million fourth quarter 2003 charge for asset impairments ($3.6 million after tax) related to the companys pain management pump program. This program was administered internally with regard to marketing and sales and by a third party partner for manufacture and future product development. For 2003, the company recorded $0.1 million in net sales related to pain management pump products. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the company reassessed the pain management pump program and determined that the program was not meeting the companys strategic objectives. Based upon this reassessment, the company informed its partner of the companys termination of the development arrangement. The asset impairment charge related primarily to the write off of intangible and tangible assets associated with the pain management pump program. In addition to the pain management pump program impairment described above, the company recorded during the fourth quarter of 2003 an additional impairment charge for the assets of a minor product offering. This impairment was triggered by the rapidly declining sales and associated cash flows of this product. Divisional and manufacturing restructuring During the first and third quarters of 2002, based upon reviews of administrative, divisional and manufacturing operations, the companys management, with board approval, committed to certain initiatives to eliminate excess capacity, reduce redundant positions and improve product profitability. These initiatives included the exit from two manufacturing facilities in the United States, one manufacturing facility in Europe and two administrative offices in the United States by the end of 2003. A total of 617 manufacturing, manufacturing support and administrative positions were eliminated at these five locations and elsewhere. The manufacturing initiatives resulted in the consolidation of manufacturing operations into existing facilities in Mexico, Malaysia and the United States. The company accounted for these initiatives in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). In total, the company recorded pretax charges of $33.7 million ($20.7 million after tax) in other (income) expense, net during 2002 ($9.1 million in the first quarter of 2002 and $24.6 million in the third quarter of 2002). The table below summarizes the 2002 restructuring charges and associated accruals for the three years ended December 31, 2004. Beginning Balance Cash Paid Non cash Charges 12/31/02Accrual Cash Paid Adjustments 12/31/03Accrual Cash Paid 12/31/04Accrual (dollars in millions) Restructuring provisions Termination benefits $ 19.8 $ (8.2 ) $ 11.6 $ (6.8 ) $ (2.5 ) $ 2.3 $ (2.0 ) $ 0.3 Property, plant and equipment impairment 8.1 $ (8.1 ) Lease termination 2.3 2.3 (0.5 ) (0.2 ) 1.6 (0.3 ) 1.3 Idle facility costs 3.5 (0.3 ) 3.2 (1.2 ) (1.5 ) 0.5 0.5 Total restructuring provisions $ 33.7 $ (8.2 ) $ (8.4 ) $ 17.1 $ (8.5 ) $ (4.2 ) $ 4.4 $ (2.3 ) $ 2.1 The 2002 termination benefit charge of $19.8 million consisted of severance payments and benefit continuation payments for 617 positions. Lump sum payments were made throughout 2003. The company recorded a charge of $8.1 million for the impairment of property, plant and equipment. This charge was II 11 determined based on the impaired assets net book value compared to their estimated fair market value, including estimated proceeds from disposal. The company recorded a charge of $2.3 million for the estimated present value of future non cancelable lease payments. This charge was estimated based upon the contractual terms of the agreements. The company believes that due to current market conditions sublease revenues are unlikely. The company will attempt to sell the closed facilities and either redeploy or dispose of the associated assets. The company recorded a charge of $3.5 million for idle facility costs for committed operating expenses which were incurred after the closed facilities ceased production but prior to disposition. Through December 31, 2004, the company has eliminated 610 positions and closed all five facilities. The 2003 accrual reduction of $4.2 million was offset by incremental expense related to the shortfall in the estimated proceeds for the closed manufacturing facilities of approximately $1.7 million. The net adjustment to 2002 divisional and manufacturing restructuring was a $2.5 million pretax gain ($1.6 million after tax) recorded in other (income) expense, net. In 2004, the company recorded a pretax gain of $2.7 million ($2.6 million after tax) related to the disposal of a manufacturing facility closed as a result of a prior year restructuring program. The pretax operating savings resulting from the companys restructuring activities are integral to the companys overall program of continuous manufacturing improvement. Savings are primarily realized through reduced salary expense and greater productivity. In 2002, the company achieved incremental pretax operating savings of approximately $6.9 million from restructuring activities and the companys ongoing program of manufacturing improvement (approximately $3.7 million in cost of goods sold and approximately $3.2 million in selling, general and administrative expense). These 2002 savings were offset by approximately $1.0 million of pretax transition costs. In 2003, the company achieved overall incremental pretax operating savings of approximately $36.0 million from restructuring activities and the companys ongoing program of manufacturing improvement (approximately $33.2 million in cost of goods sold and approximately $2.8 million in selling, general and administrative expense). These 2003 savings were offset by approximately $5.2 million of pretax transition costs. Incremental improvements in the companys operating cash flow have approximated the improvement in the companys pretax operating savings. With the exception of some ongoing termination benefit payments, the company considers all activities related to this restructuring plan closed. Merger termination costs On May 29, 2001, Bard entered into an agreement that provided for the merger of Bard with a subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. (Tyco Merger Agreement). On February 6, 2002, Bard and Tyco agreed to terminate this agreement. Each company agreed to bear its own costs and expenses. Neither company paid a break up fee. In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded a pretax charge of $6.2 million ($4.0 million after tax) associated with the termination of the Tyco Merger Agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the company reversed the remaining accruals for termination costs and recorded a pretax gain of $0.4 million ($0.2 million after tax). Noncontrolling interest The company has entered into one product development arrangement with Genyx Medical, Inc. resulting in a variable interest entity for which Bard is the primary beneficiary. This arrangement requires consolidation under the provisions of FIN 46. For the full year ended December 31, 2004, the company recorded approximately $1.5 million in research and development expense and a corresponding credit in other (income) expense, net for noncontrolling interest related to this arrangement. Taxes The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2004 2003 2002 U.S. federal statutory rate 35 % 35 % 35 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1 % 1 % 2 % Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (10 )% (11 )% (11 )% Other, net 1 % 1 % Effective tax rate 27 % 25 % 27 % II 12 The variability in the companys effective tax rate between 2004 and 2003 is primarily attributable to the impact of certain commercial litigation related to the companys brachytherapy business. See Note 11 Other (Income) Expense, Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. Such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. The companys U.S. federal tax filings have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for calendar years ending prior to 1996. All differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. The company is currently under examination by the IRS for the 1996 through 1999 calendar years. The companys U.K. affiliates tax filings have been examined by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for tax years ending prior to 1999. All differences arising from these audits have been resolved and settled. The companys U.K. affiliates tax filings are currently under examination by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for the 1999 through 2002 tax years. Net Income and Earnings Per Share Bard reported 2004 consolidated net income of $302.8 million, an increase of 80% over 2003 consolidated net income of $168.5 million. Bard reported 2004 diluted earnings per share of $2.82, an increase of 76% over 2003 diluted earnings per share of $1.60. Bard reported 2003 consolidated net income of $168.5 million, an increase of 9% over 2002 consolidated net income of $155.0 million. Bard reported 2003 diluted earnings per share of $1.60, an increase of 9% over 2002 diluted earnings per share of $1.47. As described above under other (income) expense, net, certain events in 2004, 2003 and 2002 impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. Stock Split Stock Split On April 21, 2004, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 2 for 1 stock split, which was effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The dividend was distributed on May 28, 2004 to shareholders of record as of May 17, 2004. All earnings per share amounts and dividend per share amounts within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been restated to reflect the stock split. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, investments in businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Cash $ 15.1 $ 29.0 $ 23.1 Cash equivalents 525.7 388.4 350.6 Short term investments 4.6 4.6 9.5 Subtotal $ 545.4 $ 422.0 $ 383.2 Working capital $ 663.7 $ 453.2 $ 441.1 Current ratio 2.70/1 2.07/1 2.39/1 Net cash position $ 393.9 $ 253.9 $ 230.1 II 13 Short term investments that have original maturities of ninety days or less are considered cash equivalents. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash, cash equivalents and short term investments less total debt. Substantially all of the companys cash equivalents and short term investments are held by wholly or majority owned foreign subsidiaries and are invested in highly rated, liquid investments including time deposits and money funds. Should it be necessary, these investments could be repatriated back to the United States resulting in additional United States income taxes. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for the company to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings in the form of an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The company may elect to apply this provision in 2005. The company has begun evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision and expects to complete this evaluation within a reasonable period of time. Based on the companys analysis to date, the range of possible amounts being considered for repatriation is between zero and $750 million. The related potential range of income tax is between zero and $55 million. Notwithstanding the potential impact of AJCA, the company believes that its domestic cash needs can be satisfied with domestic operating cash flows and additional borrowings if required. The following table provides cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 277.2 $ 263.6 $ 261.6 Net cash used in investing activities $ (86.9 ) $ (185.6 ) $ (54.4 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (88.1 ) $ (55.1 ) $ (103.7 ) Operating activities During 2004, the company generated $277.2 million cash flow from operations, $13.6 million more than the cash flow from operations reported in 2003. During 2003, the company generated $263.6 million cash flow from operations, $2.0 million more than the cash flow from operations reported in 2002. In 2004, net income of $302.8 million increased $134.3 million over net income reported in 2003. In 2003, net income of $168.5 million increased $13.5 million over net income reported in 2002. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $(25.6) million, $95.1 million and $106.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Depreciation expense was approximately $32.7 million in 2004, $29.9 million in 2003 and $27.7 million in 2002. Amortization expense was approximately $22.0 million in 2004, $14.8 million in 2003 and $14.6 million in 2002. Investing activities During 2004, the company used $86.9 million in cash for investing activities, $98.7 million less than investing activities reported in 2003. During 2003, the company used $185.6 million in cash for investing activities, $131.2 million more than investing activities reported in 2002. Consistent with the companys stated intention to divest, from time to time, lines of business in which the company is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position, the company sold certain assets of its Endoscopic Technologies Division to ConMed for $81.3 million on September 30, 2004 including a purchase price adjustment. Capital expenditures amounted to $74.0 million, $72.1 million and $41.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003 are higher than 2002 capital expenditures due to the ongoing implementation of the companys enterprise wide software platform, the construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and expansions at several manufacturing facilities. The company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million in 2005 as additional investments will be made in information technology systems and manufacturing facilities. The company spent approximately $104.4 million in 2004, $115.0 million in 2003 and $13.4 million in 2002 for the acquisition of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items to augment its existing product lines. These cash expenditures were financed primarily with cash from operations and short term borrowings. Financing activities During 2004, the company used $88.1 million in cash for financing activities, $33.0 million more than financing activities reported in 2003. During 2003, the company used $55.1 million in II 14 cash for financing activities, $48.6 million less than financing activities reported in 2002. Cash flow related to financing activities included changes in borrowings, equity proceeds related to option exercises, repurchases of company common stock and dividend payments. Total debt was $151.5 million, $168.1 million and $153.1 million at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in total debt in 2003 was primarily the result of purchases of businesses and technologies and increased capital spending and was financed with commercial paper. Total debt to total capitalization was 10.0%, 13.8% and 14.8% at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. On December 11, 2002, the companys Board of Directors approved the repurchase of 5,000,000 shares of the companys common stock. In 2004, the company spent approximately $85.9 million to purchase 1,275,000 shares. In 2003, the company spent approximately $59.4 million to purchase 886,700 shares. In 2002, the company spent approximately $71.7 million to purchase 1,340,900 shares. At December 31, 2004, a total of 3,350,800 shares remain under the companys share repurchase authorization. The company paid cash dividends of $0.47 per share in 2004, $0.45 per share in 2003 and $0.43 per share in 2002. The 2004 payment marked the 33rd consecutive year in which Bard has increased its annual dividend payout to shareholders. The company maintains a commercial paper program and a committed credit facility that supports the companys commercial paper program. The committed facility may also be used for general corporate purposes. The committed credit facility in the amount of $400.0 million matures in May of 2009. A pricing grid based on the companys long term credit ratings determines interest rates and facility fees for the facility. The facility does not require compensating balances. There were no commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2004. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2004 was approximately $88.0 million with an average outstanding balance of $34.0 million and an effective interest rate of 1.39%. At December 31, 2003 commercial paper borrowings totaled $15.7 million. There were no commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2002. Certain of the companys debt agreements contain customary representations, warranties and default provisions as well as restrictions that, among other things, require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense and limit the amount of debt that the company may have outstanding. As of December 31, 2004, the company was in compliance with all such covenants. The company has $150.0 million of unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2004. The notes mature in 2026 and pay a semi annual coupon of 6.70%. The coupon interest closely approximates the effective annual cost of the notes. The 6.70% notes due 2026 may be redeemed at the option of the note holder on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming these notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes approximates $168.1 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the companys long term debt was rated BBB+ by Standard and Poors and Baa2 by Moodys and the companys commercial paper ratings were A 2 by Standard and Poors and P 2 by Moodys. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. Commitments and Contingencies Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 2 3Years 4 5Years 5+Years (dollars in millions) Forward contracts $ 27.6 $ 27.6 Total debt 151.5 0.1 $ 0.6 $ 0.8 $ 150.0 Capital lease obligations 0.2 0.1 0.1 Operating lease obligations 56.2 16.6 18.2 8.6 12.8 Acquisition and investment milestones 92.8 83.4 9.4 Unconditional purchase obligations 40.7 34.7 6.0 Other contractual obligations 45.5 26.3 15.4 3.7 0.1 $ 414.5 $ 188.8 $ 49.7 $ 13.1 $ 162.9 II 15 Forward currency agreements The company periodically enters into forward contracts and purchases options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $151.5 million at December 31, 2004, down $16.6 million from December 31, 2003. Total debt was $168.1 million at December 31, 2003, up $15.0 million from December 31, 2002. Total debt to total capitalization was 10.0% at December 31, 2004. Total debt to total capitalization was 13.8% at December 31, 2003. Operating lease obligations The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones The company enters into various acquisition and investment arrangements, including research and development arrangements, product and intellectual property acquisitions and business combinations. In connection with some of these activities, the company agrees to make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets. Such payments, when made, are allocated to specific intangible asset categories, assigned to excess of cost over net assets acquired or charged to research and development, depending on the nature of the arrangement. The most significant of these arrangements are described below and assume all milestones will be achieved and payments made. Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years (dollars in millions) Urethral Bulking Agent Project $ 53.5 $ 53.5 Vacora Vacuum Assisted Biopsy Device Project 10.5 10.5 PTA Catheter Development Project 5.0 5.0 Bridger anniversary payments 16.2 8.1 $ 8.1 All other under $6 million 7.6 6.3 1.3 Total $ 92.8 $ 83.4 $ 9.4 The Urethral Bulking Agent Project relates to the development of a new urethral bulking agent for stress urinary incontinence by Genyx Medical, Inc. (Genyx). The agreement provided Bard with the right but not the obligation to acquire certain assets of Genyx contingent upon Genyx achieving FDA approval for the bulking agent. On January 12, 2005, Bard announced that it had acquired the agreed upon assets of Genyx. This transaction will be recorded in the first quarter of 2005. The company anticipates that the $53.5 million payment will be recorded as an intangible asset. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Vacora Vacuum Assisted Biopsy Device Project related to the companys acquisition of the intellectual property assets related to this product in the third quarter of 2003. Included in the companys acquisition of these assets is one remaining anniversary payment of $10.5 million payable in 2005. The PTA Catheter Development Project relates to the development of several high pressure, PTA balloon catheters. The milestones relate primarily to intangible assets. Due to the contingent nature of these milestones, management is unable to assess the likelihood of these milestones being achieved. The company has estimated the possible timing of these milestones and related payments. Bridger anniversary payments On June 30, 2004, the company acquired the stock of Bridger Biomed, Inc., a supplier of components for the companys soft tissue repair franchise. The acquisition agreement called for a II 16 cash payment of $8.1 million plus two anniversary payments of $8.1 million payable on the eighteenth and thirty sixth month anniversaries of the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities. These anniversary payments are recorded in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities. Unconditional purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other contractual obligations Other contractual obligations pertain primarily to project related commitments. Pension Obligations The companys objective in funding its domestic tax qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also take into account each tax qualified plans return compared to the plans corresponding expense and the extent to which each tax qualified plans accumulated benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status. In 2004, the company made voluntary contributions of $10.0 million to the companys U.S. tax qualified plan and $1.7 million to the companys non U.S. tax qualified plans. In 2003, the company made voluntary contributions of $10.0 million to the companys U.S. tax qualified plan and $7.7 million to the companys non U.S. tax qualified plans. The company will consider the factors identified above in determining its 2005 pension funding. The nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans include supplemental plans which are generally not funded. Legal Matters On March 16, 2004, Rochester Medical Corporation, Inc., filed a complaint against the company, another manufacturer and two group purchasing organizations under the caption Rochester Medical Corporation, Inc. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 304 CV 060, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). The plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendants conspired to exclude it from the market and to maintain the companys market share by engaging in a variety of conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff also has asserted claims for business disparagement, common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business relationships. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages in an unspecified amount. The company intends to defend this matter vigorously. Because the litigation is in a preliminary stage, the company cannot assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period or the companys financial condition. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement 123R, Share Based Payment, (Statement 123R) to be effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, thereby becoming effective for Bard in the third quarter of 2005. Statement 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as an operating expense in the income statement. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period based on fair values measured on grant dates. The new standard may be adopted using either the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective method. The company is currently evaluating its share based employee compensation programs, the potential impact of this statement on our consolidated financial position and results of operations and the alternative adoption methods. Managements Use of Non GAAP Measures Net sales on a constant currency basis and ongoing net sales are non GAAP financial measures. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net II 17 sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. During 2004, the company disposed of certain assets, the net sales of which are reported in the Oncology Products group. The company believes that evaluating growth in net sales of the products from assets which were not sold, or ongoing net sales, provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales of the product group. The limitation of these non GAAP measures is that they may exclude items that impact actual GAAP results. All non GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC recently issued guidance for critical accounting policies. The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates, when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Unless agreed otherwise, the companys terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss passes F.O.B. origin. Certain sales to domestic and European distributors are F.O.B. destination. For arrangements where the companys terms state F.O.B. destination, the company records sales on this basis. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out (LIFO) method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. Such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. The companys U.S. federal tax filings have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for calendar years ending prior to 1996. All differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. The company is currently under examination by the IRS for the 1996 through 1999 calendar years. The companys U.K. affiliates tax filings have been examined by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for tax years ending prior to 1999. All differences arising from these audits have been resolved and settled. The companys U.K. II 18 affiliates tax filings are currently under examination by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for the 1999 through 2002 tax years. Management believes that the company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities. These positions relate to, among others, the allocation and or recognition of income on intercompany transactions, the timing and amount of deductions and the tax treatment related to acquisitions and divestitures. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on the companys financial condition or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a reporting period. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Valuation of IPR&D, Goodwill and Intangible Assets When the company acquires another company, the purchase price is allocated, as applicable, between IPR&D, other identifiable intangible assets, tangible assets and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. IPR&D is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. For IPR&D, these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including IPR&D, of the acquired businesses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists. The test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The companys estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the companys consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Intangible assets consist primarily of patents, other intellectual property and distribution rights, which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 8 to 19 years. The company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable. II 19 Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life sustaining medical devices. These devices are often utilized on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, seriously ill patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims and other litigation, product withdrawals, recalls, field actions or other regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to those addressed above, that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to: Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including: the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing process and supply chain programs as a result of the companys restructuring, or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses, the ability to complete planned clinical trials successfully, to develop and obtain approval for products on a timely basis and to launch products on a timely basis within cost estimates, the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and integrate such transactions or to obtain agreements with favorable terms, the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by cost containment pressures or preferences for alternate therapies, the ability to maintain or increase research and development expenditures, the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales, II 20 the ability to maintain our effective tax rate and uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation, the ability to obtain appropriate levels of product liability insurance on reasonable terms, the risk that the company may not successfully implement its new ERP information system, which could adversely affect the companys results of operations in future periods or its ability to meet the ongoing requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales employees, and changes in business strategies, the effects of negative publicity concerning our products, which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products and which could result in decreased product demand or product withdrawal, the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others, damage to a company facility, which could render the company unable to manufacture a particular product (as the company may utilize only one manufacturing facility for certain of its major products) and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets and the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assets specifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets. Competitive factors, including: the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, resulting in potentially greater pricing pressures and more significant, complex and long term contracts than in the past, both in the United States and abroad, development of new products or technologies by competitors having superior performance compared to our current products or products under development, technological advances, patents and registrations obtained by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments or preventing the company from selling a product or including key features in the companys products and attempts by competitors to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs. Difficulties and delays inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products, including: lengthy and costly regulatory approval processes, which may result in lost market opportunities, delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for, procedures using newly developed products, the suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture, market or distribute existing products, the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements, such as those affecting manufacturing and labeling, performance, efficacy or safety concerns for existing products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals, litigation or declining sales, including adverse events relating to the companys vena cava filters, the failure to obtain, limitations on the use of or the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights, and the failure of efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement and legal challenges that can increase our costs, II 21 difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components and customers that may limit the number of manufacturers or vendors from which they will purchase products, which can result in the companys exclusion from large hospital systems, integrated delivery networks or group purchasing organization contracts. Governmental action, including: impact of continued health care cost containment, new laws and judicial decisions related to health care availability, payment for health care products and services or the marketing and distribution of products, including legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements for procedures that use the companys products, changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity, the impact of more vigorous compliance and enforcement activities affecting the industry in general or the company in particular, changes in the tax or environmental laws affecting our business and compliance costs and potential penalties and remediation obligations in connection with regulations regarding air emissions, waste water discharges and solid waste. Legal disputes, including: disputes over intellectual property rights, product liability claims, claims asserting securities law violations, claims asserting violations of federal law in connection with Medicare and or Medicaid reimbursement, derivative shareholder actions, claims asserting antitrust violations and environmental matters, including the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use of hazardous materials in the companys manufacturing, sterilization and research activities and the potential for the company to be held liable for any resulting damages. General economic conditions, including: international and domestic business conditions, political instability in foreign countries, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation. Other factors beyond our control, including catastrophes, both natural and man made, earthquakes, floods, fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war. II 22 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Mexican Peso and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2004 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $1.4 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $2.9 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming these notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes approximates $168.1 million at December 31, 2004. Assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes would approximate $150.4 million and $191.0 million, respectively, on December 31, 2004. II 23 MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. With respect to the scope of this report, in accordance with FIN 46, the company consolidated financial information related to Genyx Medical, Inc., a variable interest entity, in 2004. While the companys consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the variable interest entity, management has been unable to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at that entity since the company does not have the ability to dictate or modify the controls of Genyx Medical, Inc. and does not have the ability, in practice, to assess those controls. As a result, the companys conclusion regarding the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 does not include an assessment of the internal controls of Genyx Medical, Inc., which is associated with total assets of $27.4 million, liabilities of $11.7 million and research and development expenses of $1.5 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the company as of December 31, 2004. Based on our assessment and those criteria, subject to the foregoing, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. The companys registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of the companys internal control over financial reporting. That report appears on page II 27.
