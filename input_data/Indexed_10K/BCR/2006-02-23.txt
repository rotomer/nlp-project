Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The company is engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company markets its products to hospitals, individual health care professionals, extended care health facilities and alternate site facilities in the United States and abroad, principally in Europe and Japan. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and discarded or implanted either temporarily or permanently. The company reports its results of operations around the concept of disease state management in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products. The company strives to have a leadership position in all of its markets. Approximately 81% of the companys net sales in 2005 were derived from products in which the company has a number one or number two market leadership position. The companys key growth initiatives include continued focus on research and development, the further expansion of its sales organization, business development activities and improved manufacturing efficiencies. The companys margins and net income are driven by the companys ability to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. The companys ability to improve sales over time depends in part upon its success in developing and marketing new products. In this regard, over the last four years the company has strategically increased funding of research and development activities by approximately 115%, with a focus on products and markets that are growing faster than 8% annually. In 2005, the company spent approximately $114.6 million on research and development. The company expects research and development spending to continue to increase in 2006. In light of the complexity of the process of developing and bringing new products to market, the company expects a lag of as much as several years before the results of increased research and development spending are reflected in increased net sales. In addition, there can be no assurance that research and development activities will successfully generate new products or that new products will be successful in the market. In 2003, as part of its effort to generate increased sales, the company increased its U.S. sales force by approximately 50 sales positions. In 2004, the company implemented a further sales force expansion to increase its U.S. sales force by approximately 60 sales positions and to increase its international sales force, primarily in Europe, by approximately 40 sales positions. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the company added approximately 55 additional sales positions in the United States. The company believes that its sales force expansions enhance geographic coverage, increase focus on high growth businesses, facilitate new product introductions and aid in the identification of new product opportunities at the call point level. The company also plans to generate increased sales through selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies. In general, the company focuses on small to medium size acquisitions of products and technologies that complement the companys existing product portfolio. In addition, the company may from time to time selectively consider acquisitions of larger, established companies under appropriate circumstances. From time to time, the company may divest lines of business in which the company is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position or for other strategic reasons. For a discussion of acquisitions and dispositions which the company completed during 2005 and 2004, see the information in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report. The company has a comprehensive program aimed at improving manufacturing efficiencies. This program has built on the companys past restructuring activities and has resulted in sustained improvement of both margins and cash flow. Gross margins as a percentage of net sales improved by 140 basis points in 2005 as compared to 2004. The improved cash flow associated with these activities provides additional funding for the companys research and development activities and other growth initiatives discussed above. II 3 Table of Contents Working capital increased from approximately $391 million at the end of 2001 to approximately $623.5 million at the end of 2005. The companys strong financial position further enables the company to pursue its growth initiatives. Results of Operations Net Sales The companys revenues are generated from sales of the companys products, net of discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. Bard reported 2005 consolidated net sales of $1,771.3 million, an increase of 7% on a reported basis over 2004 consolidated net sales of $1,656.1 million. Bards 2004 consolidated net sales increased 16% on a reported basis over consolidated net sales of $1,433.1 million in 2003. Net sales excluding sales of Endoscopic Technologies products, divested in 2004 (which were previously reported as part of the oncology group), are referred to as ongoing net sales. Bards 2005 ongoing net sales increased 9% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. In 2004, ongoing net sales increased 14% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Ongoing net sales is a non GAAP measure and not a replacement for GAAP results. See Commitments and Contingencies Managements Use of Non GAAP Measures below. On December 29, 2005, the company initiated a voluntary product recall of its Bard&reg; Composix&reg; Kugel&reg; Mesh X Large Patch intended for ventral hernia repair. The companys sales results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 included a net sales reduction of $7.8 million in the surgical specialty group due to this recall, resulting in a 1 percentage point reduction in 2005 consolidated ongoing net sales growth in constant currency. Following the recall, the FDA conducted a follow up inspection and issued an FDA Form 483 identifying certain observations. The company is in the process of addressing these observations and cannot give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with the companys response. The geographic breakdown of net sales by the location of the third party customer for each of the last three years is presented below: 2005 2004 2003 United States 69 % 70 % 71 % Europe 19 % 19 % 18 % Japan 5 % 5 % 5 % Rest of world 7 % 6 % 6 % Total net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % The growth in consolidated net sales in 2005 was not materially impacted by price changes compared to the prior year. The growth in consolidated net sales in 2004 included a decrease of 0.4% as a result of price reductions compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales were also affected by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing 2005 consolidated net sales by 0.6% as compared to the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing 2004 consolidated net sales by 2.6% as compared to the prior year. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities. Bards 2005 United States net sales of $1,223.8 million increased 6% over 2004 United States net sales of $1,156.2 million. Bards 2005 international net sales of $547.5 million increased 10% on a reported basis (8% on a constant currency basis) over 2004 international net sales of $499.9 million. Bards 2004 United States net sales of $1,156.2 million increased 13% over 2003 United States net sales of $1,020.4 million. Bards 2004 international net sales of $499.9 million increased 21% on a reported basis (12% on a constant currency basis) over 2003 international net sales of $412.7 million. See Commitments and Contingencies Managements Use of Non GAAP Measures below.

Costs and Expenses The companys costs and expenses consist of cost of goods sold, marketing, selling and administrative expense, research and development expense, interest expense and other (income) expense, net. Cost of goods sold consists principally of the manufacturing and distribution costs of the companys products. Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the companys sales and administrative organizations. Research and development expense consists principally of expenses incurred with respect to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third party research and development activities and IPR&D arising from the companys business development activities. Interest expense consists of interest charges on indebtedness. Other (income) expense, net consists principally of interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and other items, some of which may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years shown: 2005 2004 2003 Cost of goods sold 38.5 % 39.9 % 42.5 % Marketing, selling and administrative expense 30.2 % 31.5 % 31.3 % Research and development expense 6.5 % 6.7 % 6.1 % Interest expense 0.7 % 0.8 % 0.9 % Other (income) expense, net (1.3 )% (3.9 )% 3.6 % Total costs and expenses 74.6 % 75.0 % 84.4 % Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 38.5%, a reduction of 140 basis points from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 of 39.9%. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in 2004 represented a reduction of 260 basis points from cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 of 42.5%. The primary reason for these improvements to cost of goods sold was manufacturing efficiencies driven by higher production volumes and continuous manufacturing cost improvement projects. The rate of improvement has moderated in recent periods. II 7 Table of Contents Marketing, selling and administrative expense The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 30.2%, a decrease of 130 basis points from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2004 of 31.5%. Lower implementation costs associated with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes Oxley) and lower compensation costs as a percentage of net sales contributed to the favorable marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 31.5%, an increase of 20 basis points from the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 of 31.3%. The primary factors in the increased percentage were higher payments under sales compensation plans, the incremental effect of the companys sales expansion program and increased spending related to the companys compliance with the internal control requirements of Sarbanes Oxley. Research and development expense Research and development expenses are comprised of expenses related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third party research and development activities and acquired IPR&D costs arising from the companys business development activities. The components of internal research and development expense include: salary and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and milestone payments for third party research and development. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The following table presents the breakdown of the companys research and development expense: 2005 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) Internally managed research and development $ 114.6 $ 104.9 $ 86.4 Acquired in process research and development 6.7 1.0 Total research and development expense $ 114.6 $ 111.6 $ 87.4 Research and development expenditures of $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 represented a 2.7% increase over the prior years expenditures of $111.6 million. In 2005, the company recorded no IPR&D expense. Research and development expenditures in 2004 of $111.6 million represented a 27.7% increase over the prior years expenditures of $87.4 million. For the full year ended December 31, 2004, the company recorded IPR&D expense of $6.7 million primarily related to the acquisition of the assets of Onux Medical, Inc. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Interest expense Interest expense in 2005 was $12.2 million as compared with 2004 interest expense of $12.7 million and 2003 interest expense of $12.5 million. Other (income) expense, net The table below presents the components of other (income) expense, net for each of the three years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (dollars in thousands) Interest income $ (18,500 ) $ (8,400 ) $ (6,600 ) Foreign exchange losses 1,700 900 1,000 Gain on Endoscopic Technologies asset divestiture (45,500 ) Legal settlements, net (1,600 ) 54,500 Investment gains (9,700 ) (6,200 ) Asset impairments 8,900 6,100 Divisional and manufacturing restructuring (2,700 ) (2,500 ) Royalty reserve reversal (7,100 ) Noncontrolling interest (1,500 ) Other, net 2,300 1,300 Total other (income) expense, net $ (22,400 ) $ (63,700 ) $ 52,500 II 8 Table of Contents Interest income For the year ended December 31, 2005, interest income was approximately $18.5 million compared to approximately $8.4 million and $6.6 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 was due to higher interest rates and cash balances. Gain on Endoscopic Technologies asset divestiture Consistent with the companys stated intention to divest from time to time lines of business in which the company is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position, the company sold certain assets of its Endoscopic Technologies Division to ConMed for $81.3 million on September 30, 2004, including a post closing adjustment. The products associated with this sale are used primarily by gastroenterologists for endoscopic procedures. Significant assets of the Endoscopic Technologies Division were retained by the company. Net sales associated with the divested assets were approximately $46 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004 and approximately $54 million in 2003. The company did not separately track the pretax profitability of the disposed assets due to the companys shared corporate infrastructure and the integration of the disposed assets with assets remaining with the company. A summary of the book value of the disposed assets is as follows: (dollars in millions) Inventories $11.6 Machinery and equipment, net of depreciation $ 3.7 Intangible assets, net of amortization $ 3.9 Assumed liabilities $ 2.6 As a result of the sale, the company recorded a pretax gain of $45.5 million in other (income) expense, net ($31.1 million after tax) in 2004. Legal settlements, net In the first quarter of 2004, the company settled certain commercial litigation related to the companys brachytherapy business and reversed $16.0 million ($9.8 million after tax) of a $58.0 million pretax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to this litigation. In addition, during the first quarter of 2004, the company recorded a $3.9 million pretax charge for an unrelated legal settlement ($2.3 million after tax). In the second quarter of 2004, the company settled an intellectual property dispute related to certain of the companys laparoscopic irrigators and recorded a pretax charge of $10.5 million ($6.3 million after tax). In the fourth quarter of 2003, the company recorded a pretax charge of $58.0 million ($35.5 million after tax) for certain commercial litigation related to the companys brachytherapy business. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the company reached a settlement on an intellectual property matter and recorded a pretax gain of $3.5 million ($2.1 million after tax). Investment gains For the year ended December 31, 2005, other (income) expense, net included pretax income of approximately $9.7 million from investment gains primarily related to the companys previous investment in Implex Corp., a privately held corporation (Implex). On April 23, 2004, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. announced that it had acquired all of the outstanding stock of Implex for $98.6 million in cash plus contingent performance payments. In 2004, the company recorded a $6.2 million pretax gain associated with cash received at the closing. In 2005, Bard recorded a $6.6 million pretax gain related to the receipt of the contingent performance payments. Asset impairments As a result of a strategic review, in the third quarter of 2005, other (income) expense, net included an asset impairment charge of approximately $8.9 million related to the 2004 acquisition of Advanced Surgical Concepts Ltd. The majority of the $6.1 million fourth quarter 2003 charge for asset impairments related primarily to the write off of intangible and tangible assets associated with the companys pain management pump program. In 2003, the company also recorded an impairment charge for the assets of a minor product offering. This impairment was triggered by the rapidly declining sales and associated cash flows from this product. II 9 Table of Contents Divisional and manufacturing restructuring In 2002, the companys management, with board approval, committed to certain initiatives to eliminate excess capacity, reduce redundant positions and improve product profitability. As of December 31, 2005, no liability exists for this restructuring program. Other (income) expense, net included a gain of $2.7 million in 2004, related to the disposal of a manufacturing facility closed as a result of the restructuring program. Other (income) expense, net included a gain of $2.5 million in 2003, related to net adjustments of the 2002 divisional and manufacturing restructuring. Royalty reserve reversal In the second quarter 2005, other (income) expense, net included income of approximately $7.1 million pretax resulting from the reversal of a reserve related to a patent matter. Noncontrolling interest Prior to acquiring Genyx, the company had entered into one product development arrangement with Genyx, resulting in a variable interest entity for which Bard was the primary beneficiary. This arrangement required consolidation under the provisions of Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). For the full year ended December 31, 2004, the company recorded approximately $1.5 million in research and development expense and a corresponding credit in other (income) expense, net for noncontrolling interest related to this arrangement. Income tax provision The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the statutory rates: 2005 2004 2003 U.S. federal statutory rate 35 % 35 % 35 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1 % 1 % 1 % Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (8 )% (10 )% (11 )% Tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the AJCA 7 % Resolution of prior period tax items (10 )% Other, net 1 % Effective tax rate 25 % 27 % 25 % The variability in the companys effective tax rate between 2005 and 2004 is primarily attributable to the reduction of the income tax provision related to the resolution of the 1996 1999 tax audit, offset by the tax impact of the 2005 repatriation of $600 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The variability in the companys effective tax rate between 2004 and 2003 is primarily attributable to the impact of certain commercial litigation related to the companys brachytherapy business. See Note 11 Other (Income) Expense, Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. Such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. The companys U.S. federal tax filings have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for calendar years ending prior to 2000. The company believes all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. In the third quarter of 2005, the companys income tax provision was reduced by $45.6 million predominately due to the favorable conclusion of the IRSs examination of the 1996 1999 tax years, as well as the resolution of certain other tax items. The companys U.K. affiliates tax filings have been examined by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for the tax years ending prior to 1999. The company believes all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. As of December 31, 2005, the companys U.K. affiliates tax filings are under examination by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for the 1999 through 2003 tax years.

As described above under other (income) expense, net, certain items in 2005, 2004 and 2003 impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. Stock Split Stock Split On April 21, 2004, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 2 for 1 stock split, which was effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The dividend was distributed on May 28, 2004 to shareholders of record as of May 17, 2004. All earnings per share amounts and dividend per share amounts within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been restated to reflect the stock split. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, investments in businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 2005 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) Cash $ 28.0 $ 15.1 $ 29.0 Cash equivalents 726.2 525.7 388.4 Short term investments 4.0 4.6 4.6 Subtotal $ 758.2 $ 545.4 $ 422.0 Working capital $ 623.5 $ 663.7 $ 453.2 Current ratio 1.97/1 2.70/1 2.07/1 Total debt $ 301.4 $ 151.5 $ 168.1 Net cash position $ 456.8 $ 393.9 $ 253.9 Short term investments that have original maturities of ninety days or less are considered cash equivalents. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Net cash position is defined as cash, cash equivalents and short term investments less total debt. In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for the company to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings in the form of an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain cash dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the third quarter of 2005, the company approved a plan to repatriate $600 million of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. The repatriation was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005. II 11 Table of Contents The following table provides cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 2005 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 401.1 $ 277.2 $ 263.6 Net cash used in investing activities $ (166.1 ) $ (86.9 ) $ (185.6 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (2.6 ) $ (88.1 ) $ (55.1 ) Operating activities During 2005, the company generated $401.1 million of cash flow from operations, $123.9 million more than the cash flow from operations reported in 2004.

In 2005, net income of $337.1 million increased $34.3 million over net income reported in 2004. In 2004, net income of $302.8 million increased $134.3 million over net income reported in 2003. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $64.0 million, $(25.6) million and $95.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depreciation expense was approximately $39.0 million in 2005, reflecting higher levels of capital expenditures in recent years. Depreciation expense was approximately $32.7 million and $29.9 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization expense was approximately $24.8 million in 2005, $22.0 million in 2004 and $14.8 million in 2003. Investing activities During 2005, the company used $166.1 million in cash for investing activities, $79.2 million more than investing activities reported in 2004. During 2004, the company used $86.9 million in cash for investing activities, $98.7 million less than investing activities reported in 2003. Consistent with the companys stated intention to divest, from time to time, lines of business in which the company is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position, the company sold certain assets of its Endoscopic Technologies Division to ConMed for $81.3 million on September 30, 2004 including a purchase price adjustment. Capital expenditures amounted to $97.2 million, $74.0 million and $72.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is due to the ongoing implementation of the companys enterprise wide software platform, the construction of a consolidated domestic distribution center and expansions at several manufacturing facilities. The company spent approximately $79.1 million in 2005, $104.4 million in 2004 and $115.0 million in 2003 for the acquisition of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items to augment its existing product lines. These cash expenditures support the companys growth initiatives and were financed primarily with cash from operations and short term borrowings. Financing activities During 2005, the company used $2.6 million in cash for financing activities, $85.5 million less than financing activities reported in 2004. During 2004, the company used $88.1 million in cash for financing activities, $33.0 million more than financing activities reported in 2003. Cash flow related to financing activities included changes in borrowings, equity proceeds related to option exercises, repurchases of company common stock and dividend payments. Total debt was $301.4 million, $151.5 million and $168.1 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total debt to total capitalization was 16.4%, 10.0% and 13.8% at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Short term debt increased to $300.6 million at December 31, 2005 from $0.1 million at December 31, 2004 and reflects $150.0 million of new short term borrowings outside the United States and the reclassification to current maturities of $150.0 million of 6.7% notes due in 2026, which may be redeemed at the option of the note holders in 2006. On December 11, 2002, the companys Board of Directors approved the repurchase of 5,000,000 shares of the companys common stock. In 2005, the company spent approximately $143.4 million to purchase 2,200,000 shares. In 2004, the company spent approximately $85.9 million to purchase 1,275,000 shares. In 2003, the company spent approximately $59.4 million to purchase 886,700 shares, which included shares from the 10,000,000 share repurchase authorization approved in 1998. On December 14, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to $500 million of the common stock of the company. The Board of Directors rescinded its prior authorization to repurchase the 1,150,800 shares remaining under the previous authorization, approved in II 12 Table of Contents December 2002. The company paid cash dividends of $0.50 per share in 2005, $0.47 per share in 2004 and $0.45 per share in 2003. The 2005 payment marked the 34th consecutive year in which Bard has increased its annual dividend payout to shareholders. The first quarter 2006 dividend of $0.13 per share was paid on February 3, 2006 to shareholders of record on January 23, 2006. At December 31, 2005, short term borrowings consisted of $150 million of loans payable under a bank facility outside the United States. There were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, the average outstanding balance of short term borrowings was $5.8 million with an effective interest rate of 4.51%. The average outstanding balance of short term borrowings in 2004 was $34.0 million with an effective interest rate of 1.39%. The company has in place a domestic syndicated bank credit facility totaling $400 million that supports the commercial paper program and can be used for other general corporate purposes. The credit facility expires in May 2009 and includes pricing based on the companys long term credit rating. In addition, on October 21, 2005, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the company entered into a $250 million syndicated bank credit facility to be used for general corporate needs including in support of its decision in 2005 to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings under the AJCA. Loans under the facility bear interest at the companys option at a fixed spread to LIBOR or the higher of prime rate and 0.50% over the federal funds rate. The facility expires in October 2008. At December 31, 2005, there were $150.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility. At December 31, 2005, the company had $150 million of unsecured notes outstanding. The notes mature in 2026 and pay a semi annual coupon of 6.70%. The coupon interest closely approximates the effective annual cost of the notes. The 6.70% notes due 2026 may be redeemed at the option of the note holder on December 1, 2006 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. In accordance with FAS No. 78, Classification of Obligations that are Callable by the Creditor, the company has classified these notes as current. If the note holders do not exercise their option on December 1, 2006, the option will expire and the notes will revert to a long term classification. Assuming the notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes approximates $171.3 million at December 31, 2005. Certain of the companys debt agreements contain customary representations, warranties and default provisions as well as restrictions that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum net worth and operating cash flow levels and limit the amount of debt that the company may have outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, the company was in compliance with all such financial covenants. At December 31, 2005, the companys long term debt was rated A by Standard and Poors and Baa1 by Moodys, and the companys commercial paper ratings were A 1 by Standard and Poors and P 2 by Moodys. The company believes that this overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility. Commitments and Contingencies Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 2 3Years 4 5Years 5+Years (dollars in millions) Forward contracts $ 23.5 $ 23.5 $ $ $ Total debt (assuming earliest put date) 301.4 300.6 0.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 Operating lease obligations 39.5 15.8 18.0 4.8 0.9 Acquisition and investment milestones 16.1 6.2 9.9 Purchase obligations 98.9 86.3 9.0 3.6 Other long term liabilities 73.1 22.9 15.3 34.9 $ 552.6 $ 432.5 $ 60.6 $ 23.7 $ 35.8 II 13 Table of Contents Forward contracts The company periodically enters into forward contracts and purchases options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Because these forward currency agreements were entered into as hedges, these obligations will be funded by the underlying hedged item. Total debt Total debt was $301.4 million at December 31, 2005, up $149.9 million from December 31, 2004. Total debt was $151.5 million at December 31, 2004, down $16.6 million from December 31, 2003. Total debt to total capitalization was 16.4% at December 31, 2005. Total debt to total capitalization was 10.0% at December 31, 2004. Operating lease obligations The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Acquisition and investment milestones The company enters into various acquisition and investment arrangements, including research and development arrangements, product and intellectual property acquisitions and business combinations. In connection with some of these activities, the company agrees to make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets. Such payments, when made, are allocated to specific intangible asset categories, assigned to excess of cost over net assets acquired or charged to research and development, depending on the nature of the arrangement. The most significant of these arrangements are described below and assume all milestones will be achieved and payments made. Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years (dollars in millions) PTA Catheter Development Project $ 5.0 $ 4.0 $ 1.0 Bridger anniversary payments 8.1 8.1 All other under $6 million 3.0 2.2 0.8 Total $ 16.1 $ 6.2 $ 9.9 The PTA Catheter Development Project relates to the development of several peripheral PTA balloon catheters. The milestones relate primarily to intangible assets. Due to the contingent nature of these milestones, management is unable to assess the likelihood of these milestones being achieved. The company has estimated the possible timing of these milestones and related payments. On June 30, 2004, the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bridger Biomed, Inc., a supplier of components for the companys soft tissue repair franchise. The acquisition agreement called for a cash payment of $8.1 million, the assumption of certain liabilities and two anniversary payments of $8.1 million payable on the eighteenth and thirty sixth month anniversaries of the transaction. At December 31, 2005, the second anniversary payment remains unpaid and is recorded in other long term liabilities. Purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other long term liabilities Other long term liabilities include pension liabilities, product liabilities, and other long term liabilities of approximately $73.1 million, as well as $8.1 million presented in acquisition and investment milestones in the contractual obligations table above. II 14 Table of Contents Pension Obligations The companys objective in funding its domestic tax qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also take into account each tax qualified plans return compared to the plans corresponding expense and the extent to which each tax qualified plans accumulated benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status. In 2005, the company made voluntary contributions of $16.0 million to the companys U.S. tax qualified plan and $1.5 million to the companys non U.S. tax qualified plans. In 2004, the company made voluntary contributions of $10.0 million to the companys U.S. tax qualified plan and $1.7 million to the companys non U.S. tax qualified plans. The company will consider the factors identified above in determining its 2006 pension funding. The nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans include supplemental plans which are generally not funded. Legal Matters On March 16, 2004, Rochester Medical Corporation, Inc., filed a complaint against the company, another manufacturer and two group purchasing organizations under the caption Rochester Medical Corporation, Inc. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 304 CV 060, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). The plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendants conspired to exclude it from the market and to maintain the companys market share by engaging in conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff also has asserted claims for business disparagement, common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business relationships. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages in an unspecified amount. The company intends to defend this matter vigorously. The parties are in the discovery stage. Because the litigation is in a preliminary stage, the company cannot assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period or the companys financial position or liquidity. The company is a defendant in an action entitled Sakharam D. Mahurkar v. C. R. Bard, Inc., Bard Access Systems, Inc. and Bard Healthcare, Inc. (Civil Action No. 01 C 8452, United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois). The action commenced in November 2001. The plaintiff alleges that the company is infringing one or more of the claims of several of the plaintiffs U.S. patents for dialysis catheters. The action seeks a permanent injunction, monetary damages for the period of alleged infringement, treble damages and attorneys fees. On December 9, 2004, the court stayed the trial date pending the outcome of the reexamination of one of the patents at issue. The company does not expect the matter to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, the matter could be material to the companys business and results of operations for a future period. New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (FAS 151). FAS 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. The provisions of FAS 151 are effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of FAS 151 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the companys financial position, liquidity or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R). FAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as an operating expense in the income statement. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period based on fair values measured on grant dates. The company is currently evaluating its share based employee compensation programs, the potential impact of this statement on its consolidated financial position and results of operations and the alternative adoption methods. On March 29, 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107, Share Based Payment, which clarified the SECs expectations with regard to the assumptions underlying the fair value estimates of options. On April 14, 2005, the SEC amended the compliance dates for FAS 123R. Under the SECs new rule, FAS 123R is effective for Bard beginning January 1, 2006. The company estimates incremental expense in 2006 related to the adoption of FAS 123R of approximately $19 million after tax. See Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements. II 15 Table of Contents In December 2004, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP FAS 109 1 clarifies that the tax deduction for manufacturers provided for in the AJCA should be accounted for as a special deduction rather than as a tax rate reduction. In December 2004, the FASB also issued FSP No. FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the third quarter of 2005, the company approved a plan to repatriate $600 million of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. Accordingly, the company recorded a tax provision of approximately $32 million associated with this plan. The repatriation was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005. Consistent with FSP No. FAS 109 2, the company has not provided income taxes on its residual international unrepatriated earnings. In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (FAS 154). This Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. FAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition through a cumulative adjustment within net income of the period of the change. FAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, the Statement does not change the specific transition provisions of any existing or future accounting pronouncements. Managements Use of Non GAAP Measures Net sales on a constant currency basis and ongoing net sales are non GAAP financial measures. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. During 2004, the company disposed of certain assets, the net sales of which are reported in the Oncology Products group. The company believes that evaluating growth in net sales of the products from operating assets which were not divested, or ongoing net sales, provides an additional and meaningful assessment of comparable operations. The limitation of these non GAAP measures is that, by excluding certain items, they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. All non GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result. II 16 Table of Contents Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates, when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Unless agreed otherwise, the companys terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss passes F.O.B. origin. Certain sales to domestic and European distributors are F.O.B. destination. For arrangements where the companys terms state F.O.B. destination, the company records sales on this basis. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out (LIFO) method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Legal reserve estimates The company is at times involved in legal actions, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. A liability is recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Tax estimates The company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities. These positions relate to, among others, the allocation and or recognition of income on intercompany transactions, the timing and amount of deductions and the tax treatment related to acquisitions and divestitures. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The company regularly assesses its tax position for such transactions and includes reserves for those differences in position. The reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired or the matter is otherwise resolved. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on the companys financial position or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a future period. The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. Such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. The companys U.S. federal tax filings have been examined by the IRS for calendar years ending prior to 2000. The company believes all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. In the third quarter of 2005, the companys income tax provision was reduced by $45.6 million predominately due to the favorable conclusion of the IRSs examination of the 1996 1999 tax years, as well as the resolution of certain other tax items. The companys U.K. affiliates tax filings have been examined by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for the tax years ending prior to 1999. The company believes all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. As of December 31, 2005, the companys U.K. affiliates tax filings are under examination by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for the 1999 through 2003 tax years. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and II 17 Table of Contents other market related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Valuation of IPR&D, Goodwill and Intangible Assets When the company acquires another company, the purchase price is allocated, as applicable, between IPR&D, other identifiable intangible assets, tangible assets and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. IPR&D is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. For IPR&D, these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including IPR&D, of the acquired businesses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists. The test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The companys estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the companys consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Intangible assets consist primarily of patents and other intellectual property, which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 8 to 24 years. The company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable. Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. II 18 Table of Contents In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life sustaining medical devices. These devices are often utilized on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, seriously ill patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims and other litigation, product withdrawals, recalls, field actions or other regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to those addressed above and those under the heading Risk Factors, that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to: Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including: the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing process and supply chain programs as a result of the companys restructuring, or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses; the effects of negative publicity concerning our products, which could result in product withdrawals or decreased product demand and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products; the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and integrate such transactions or to obtain agreements with favorable terms; the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost containment pressures or preferences for alternate therapies; the ability to maintain or increase research and development expenditures; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales; the ability to maintain our effective tax rate and uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; the risk that the company may not successfully implement its new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information system, which could adversely affect the companys results of operations in future periods or its ability to meet the ongoing requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002; internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales employees; the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others; damage to a company facility, which could render the company unable to manufacture a particular product (as the company may utilize only one manufacturing facility for certain of its major products) and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets; and the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assets specifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets. II 19 Table of Contents Competitive factors, including: the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, resulting in potentially greater pricing pressures and more significant and complex contracts than in the past, both in the United States and abroad; development of new products or technologies by competitors having superior performance compared to our current products or products under development; technological advances, patents and registrations obtained by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments or preventing the company from selling a product or including key features in the companys products; attempts by competitors to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs; and reprocessing by third party reprocessors of our products intended for single use. Difficulties and delays inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products, including: the ability to complete planned clinical trials successfully, to develop and obtain approval for products on a timely basis and to launch products on a timely basis within cost estimates; lengthy and costly regulatory approval processes, which may result in lost market opportunities; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for, procedures using newly developed products; the suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture, market or distribute existing products; the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements, such as those affecting manufacturing and labeling; performance, efficacy or safety concerns for existing products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals, litigation or declining sales, including adverse events relating to the companys vena cava filters and hernia repair products; FDA inspections resulting in FDA Form 483 notices and or warning letters identifying deficiencies in the companys current good manufacturing practices and or quality systems; warning letters which identify violations of FDA regulations could result in product holds, recalls, restrictions on future clearances by the FDA for products to which the deficiencies are reasonably related and or civil penalties; the failure to obtain, limitations on the use of or the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights, and the failure of efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement and legal challenges that can increase our costs; difficulties obtaining necessary components or raw materials used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components or raw materials or other interruptions of the supply chain; and customers that may limit the number of manufacturers or vendors from which they will purchase products, which can result in the companys exclusion from large hospital systems, integrated delivery networks or group purchasing organization contracts. Governmental action, including: impact of continued health care cost containment; new laws and judicial decisions related to health care availability, payment for health care products and services or the marketing and distribution of products, including legislative or administrative reforms to II 20 Table of Contents the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements for procedures that use the companys products; changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity; the impact of more vigorous compliance and enforcement activities affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; changes in the tax or environmental laws or standards affecting our business which could require facility upgrades or process changes and could affect production rates and output; and compliance costs and potential penalties and remediation obligations in connection with environmental laws, including, without limitation, regulations regarding air emissions, waste water discharges and solid waste. Legal disputes, including: disputes over intellectual property rights; product liability claims; claims asserting securities law violations; claims asserting violations of federal law in connection with Medicare and or Medicaid reimbursement; derivative shareholder actions; claims asserting antitrust violations; environmental claims, including those relating to accidental contamination or injury from the use of hazardous materials in the companys manufacturing, sterilization and research activities and the potential for the company to be held liable for any resulting damages; and commercial disputes, including disputes over distribution agreements, license agreements, manufacturing/supply agreements and acquisition or sale agreements. General economic conditions, including: international and domestic business conditions; political instability in foreign countries; interest rates; foreign currency exchange rates; and changes in the rate of inflation. Other factors beyond our control, including catastrophes, both natural and man made, earthquakes, floods, fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign II 21 Table of Contents currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Mexican Peso and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2005 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $1.2 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $0.8 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming these notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes approximates $171.3 million at December 31, 2005. Assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes would approximate $152.6 million or $193.3 million, respectively, on December 31, 2005. II 22 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, subject to the foregoing, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. The companys registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of the companys internal control over financial reporting. That report appears on page II 26.
