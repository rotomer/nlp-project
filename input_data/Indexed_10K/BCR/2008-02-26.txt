Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The company designs, manufacturers, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad, diversified portfolio of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care health facilities and alternate site facilities in the United States and abroad, principally in Europe and Japan. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or implanted either temporarily or permanently. The company reports sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products. The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon its success in developing, acquiring and marketing innovative and differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2007, the company spent $135.8 million on research and development (R&D), including purchased R&D. The company expects R&D spending, net of purchased R&D, to continue to increase in the future. The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small to medium sized transactions that provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may from time to time consider acquisitions of larger, established companies under appropriate circumstances. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position or for other strategic reasons. The company spent $83.6 million in 2007 for the acquisition and license of products and technologies. For a discussion of significant acquisitions that the company completed during 2007, 2006 and 2005, see the information in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Results of Continuing Operations Net Sales The companys revenues are generated from sales of the companys products, net of discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. Bard reported 2007 consolidated net sales of $2,202.0 million, an increase of 11% on a reported basis over 2006 consolidated net sales of $1,979.6 million. Bard reported 2006 consolidated net sales of $1,979.6 million, an increase of 12% on a reported basis over 2005 consolidated net sales of $1,768.4 million. Bards 2007 net sales increased 9% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Bards 2006 net sales increased 12% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. The acquisition of the StatLock&reg; stabilization device product line in the second quarter of 2006 increased the net sales growth for 2006 by approximately 2 percentage points. Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non GAAP Measures below. The table below presents the geographic breakdown of net sales by the location of the third party customer for each of the last three years: 2007 2006 2005 United States 69 % 70 % 69 % Europe 19 % 18 % 19 % Japan 5 % 5 % 5 % Rest of world 7 % 7 % 7 % Total net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % II 3 Table of Contents The growth in consolidated net sales included an increase of 0.1% and a decrease of 0.1% as a result of price changes for 2007 and 2006, respectively, when compared to the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations also impacted consolidated net sales, increasing 2007 consolidated net sales by 2.0% as compared to the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations did not impact the growth in consolidated net sales in 2006 compared to the prior year. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities. Bards 2007 United States net sales of $1,520.6 million increased 10% over 2006 United States net sales of $1,383.0 million. Bards 2007 international net sales of $681.4 million increased 14% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis over 2006 international net sales of $596.6 million. Bards 2006 United States net sales of $1,383.0 million increased 13% over 2005 United States net sales of $1,221.0 million. Bards 2006 international net sales of $596.6 million increased 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis over 2005 international net sales of $547.4 million.

Consolidated net sales in 2007 of soft tissue repair products grew 2% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year due primarily to: (i) the continuing effect of the companys decision during the quarter ended June 30, 2007 to initiate both a voluntary recall and a withdrawal of the companys reusable Salute hernia fixation device from the market; (ii) a constrained supply of the companys disposable Salute II hernia fixation device due to product component and manufacturing scale up issues; and (iii) low growth of the companys core hernia repair products. Consolidated net sales in 2006 of soft tissue repair products grew 8% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The combined effect of the Composix&reg; Kugel&reg; patch recall in 2005 and expansions in 2006 favorably impacted soft tissue repair products net sales growth in 2006 by 1 percentage point. The trend in the core hernia repair product line could continue. The Salute II component and manufacturing scale up issues may impact consolidated net sales of the soft tissue repair product line in subsequent quarters. On December 29, 2005, the company initiated a voluntary Class I product recall of its Bard&reg; Composix&reg; Kugel&reg; Mesh X Large Patch intended for ventral hernia repair. The companys sales results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 included a net sales reduction of $7.8 million in the surgical specialty group due to this recall, resulting in a 1 percentage point reduction in 2005 consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis. Following the recall, the FDA conducted an inspection and issued a Form 483 notice to the companys Davol, Inc. subsidiary identifying certain observations. The company has addressed these observations. On March 15, 2006, the company voluntarily expanded the December 29, 2005 recall to include certain manufacturing lots of the large Composix&reg; Kugel&reg; patch and large Composix&reg; circle. In December 2006, the company decided to voluntarily expand the March recall to include additional manufacturing lots and initiated the expanded recall on January 10, 2007. The impact of these subsequent recalls was not material to the companys full year 2006 financial results. Following the expanded recall, the FDA conducted a follow up inspection and issued a Form 483 notice to Davol identifying certain observations regarding Davols quality systems. The company has responded and is in the process of addressing these observations. On April 25, 2007, Davol received a Warning Letter from the New England District Office of the FDA resulting from the follow up inspection. The Warning Letter relates specifically to non conformances in Davols quality systems previously identified in the related Form 483. The II 6 Table of Contents Warning Letter states that, until Davol resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, no premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non conformances are reasonably related will be cleared or approved. Davol presently has no such submissions before the FDA. The company has responded to all observations in the Warning Letter and intends to fully implement corrective actions to address the FDAs concerns. The company has met with FDA representatives to advise them of the progress being made in addressing observations in the Warning Letter and has proposed a re inspection of the Davol facility in the first half of 2008. The company cannot, however, give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its response to the Warning Letter or as to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the Warning Letter. For more information, see Risk Factors. On February 13, 2008, the FDA issued a Form 483 notice to the company in connection with an inspection of the companys manufacturing facility located in Humacao, Puerto Rico. The Form 483 notice identified certain observations regarding the facilitys quality systems. The facility manufactures products for many of the companys divisions and subsidiaries, including soft tissue repair products for the companys Davol subsidiary. The company is in the process of addressing these observations and preparing a response to the FDA. The company cannot give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its response to the Form 483 notice or as to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the Form 483 notice. For more information, see Risk Factors. Other Products The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain original equipment manufacturers products. Consolidated net sales in 2007 of other products were $81.4 million, an increase of 3% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2006 of other products were $79.3 million, an increase of 7% on a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Costs and Expenses The companys costs and expenses consist of cost of goods sold, marketing, selling and administrative expense, research and development expense, interest expense and other (income) expense, net.

Purchased R&D payments may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. Interest expense consists of interest charges on indebtedness. Other (income) expense, net consists principally of interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and other items, some of which may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. In January 2006, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), which impacts the comparability of cost of goods sold, marketing, selling and administrative expense, and research and development expense to 2005. See Note 11 Share Based Compensation Plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Cost of goods sold 39.3 % 38.8 % 38.4 % Marketing, selling and administrative expense 29.3 % 31.1 % 30.1 % Research and development expense 6.2 % 7.3 % 6.4 % Interest expense 0.5 % 0.9 % 0.7 % Other (income) expense, net (1.5 )% 2.0 % (1.3 )% Total costs and expenses 73.8 % 80.1 % 74.3 % II 7 Table of Contents Cost of goods sold The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 39.3%, an increase of 50 basis points from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 38.8%. The impact of incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2007 contributed approximately 20 basis points of this increase. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 38.8%, an increase of 40 basis points from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 of 38.4%. The impact of incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2006 contributed approximately 40 basis points of this increase.

The adoption of FAS 123R increased marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 by 150 basis points, partially offset by controlled spending. Research and development expense Research and development expenses are comprised of expenses related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third party research and development activities and purchased R&D costs arising from the companys business development activities. The components of internal research and development expense include: salary and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and milestone payments for third party research and development. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The following table presents the breakdown of the companys research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Research and development $ 134.2 $ 120.9 $ 113.7 Purchased research and development 1.6 24.0 Total research and development expense $ 135.8 $ 144.9 $ 113.7 Research and development expenditures in 2007 of $135.8 million represented a 6.3% decrease versus the prior years expenditures of $144.9 million. Research and development expenditures in 2006 of $144.9 million represented a 27.4% increase over the prior years expenditures of $113.7 million.

Interest expense Interest expense in 2007 was $11.9 million as compared with 2006 interest expense of $16.9 million and 2005 interest expense of $12.2 million. The decline in interest expense in 2007 was the result of decreased borrowings outside the United States. II 8 Table of Contents Other (income) expense, net The table below presents the components of other (income) expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ (30.7 ) $ (27.9 ) $ (18.5 ) Foreign exchange (gains) losses (0.8 ) (0.1 ) 1.7 Legal settlements, net (0.3 ) 69.0 Asset impairments 8.9 Investment gains (0.2 ) (2.9 ) (9.7 ) Tax matter at joint venture 1.2 Royalty reserve reversal (7.1 ) Other, net (0.3 ) 1.1 2.3 Total other (income) expense, net $ (32.3 ) $ 40.4 $ (22.4 ) Interest income For the year ended December 31, 2007, interest income was approximately $30.7 million compared to approximately $27.9 million and $18.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents. Legal settlements, net In 2006, other (income) expense, net included a charge of approximately $20.0 million for the settlement of the previously disclosed legal action entitled Sakharam D. Mahurkar v. C. R.

Income tax provision The following is a reconciliation between the effective tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 U.S. federal statutory rate 35 % 35 % 35 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2 % 1 % 1 % Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (6 )% (10 )% (8 )% Tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the AJCA 7 % Impact of foreign tax reform on deferred taxes (1 )% Resolution of prior period tax items (7 )% (10 )% Other, net 1 % Effective tax rate 30 % 20 % 25 % II 9 Table of Contents The change in the companys effective tax rate between 2006 and 2005 is primarily related to the impact of the 2005 repatriation of $600 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). See Note 3 Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The change in the companys effective tax rate between 2007 and 2006 is primarily related to the impact of the reduction of the income tax provision in 2006 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in the United States for the 2000 through 2002 tax years as well as changes in the mix of income among tax jurisdictions. The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. Such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. The companys U.S. federal tax filings have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for calendar years ending prior to 2000. The company believes all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. An audit of the companys U.S. federal tax filings for the 2003 and 2004 tax years began in the second quarter of 2006. The companys U.K. affiliates tax filings have been examined by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for the tax years ending prior to 2005. The company believes all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. An audit of the companys U.K. tax filing for the 2005 year began in the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2005, the companys income tax provision was reduced by $45.6 million predominately due to the favorable conclusion of the IRSs examination of the 1996 through 1999 tax years, as well as the resolution of certain other tax items. In 2006, the companys income tax provision was reduced by approximately $23.8 million, predominantly due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in the United States for the 2000 through 2002 tax years as well as the resolution of the U.K. audit for the 1999 through 2003 tax years. Net Income and Earnings Per Share The company reported 2007 consolidated net income of $406.4 million, an increase of 49% from 2006 consolidated net income of $272.1 million. The company reported 2007 diluted earnings per share of $3.84, an increase of 51% from 2006 diluted earnings per share of $2.55. The company reported 2006 consolidated net income of $272.1 million, a decrease of 19% from 2005 consolidated net income of $337.1 million. The company reported 2006 diluted earnings per share of $2.55, a decrease of 18% from 2005 diluted earnings per share of $3.12. Certain items in 2007, 2006 and 2005 impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods including those described above under costs and expenses and income tax provision. For additional information, see Note 16 Unaudited Interim Financial Information contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Discontinued Operations The company withdrew from the synthetic bulking market on January 31, 2007 and in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, accounts for this withdrawal as a discontinued operation. The withdrawal was based upon a strategic review of its Tegress synthetic bulking product which considered the products limited commercial success to date, significant future clinical costs and uncertain growth potential. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded an impairment charge and related costs of approximately $46.4 million pretax. II 10 Table of Contents The impact of discontinued operations was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 0.3 $ 5.9 $ 2.9 Pretax income from operations 0.1 (47.0 ) (4.1 ) Income tax provision 0.1 (4.6 ) (0.8 ) Income (loss) on operations $ $ (42.4 ) $ (3.3 ) See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, investments in businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms. The company believes that its overall financial strength gives the company sufficient financing flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Cash $ 30.4 $ 22.1 $ 28.0 Cash equivalents 458.0 394.1 726.2 Short term investments 82.2 101.0 4.0 Subtotal $ 570.6 $ 517.2 $ 758.2 Working capital $ 960.3 $ 844.6 $ 622.6 Current ratio 4.41/1 3.92/1 1.97/1 Total debt $ 150.6 $ 150.6 $ 301.4 Short term investments that have original maturities of ninety days or less are considered cash equivalents. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for the company to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings in the form of an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain cash dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the third quarter of 2005, the company approved a plan to repatriate $600 million of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. The repatriation was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005. The following table and explanations provide cash flow data from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 547.4 $ 330.2 $ 401.3 Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations $ (112.5 ) $ (357.5 ) $ (112.3 ) Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations $ (386.7 ) $ (328.4 ) $ (2.6 ) II 11 Table of Contents Operating activities from continuing operations For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the company generated cash flow from continuing operations of $547.4 million, $330.2 million and $401.3 million, respectively. Income from continuing operations was $406.4 million, $314.5 million and $340.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Adjustments to reconcile income from continuing operations to net cash provided from continuing operations was $141.0 million, $15.7 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 was due primarily to a tax payment made in the first quarter of 2006 related to the companys repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 pursuant to the AJCA and other improvements in working capital balances. Depreciation expense was approximately $48.6 million in 2007, $44.6 million in 2006 and $39.0 million in 2005. Amortization expense was approximately $31.4 million in 2007, $26.2 million in 2006 and $20.9 million in 2005. Investing activities from continuing operations During 2007, the company used $112.5 million in cash for investing activities from continuing operations, $245.0 million less than in 2006. During 2006, the company used $357.5 million in cash for investing activities from continuing operations, $245.2 million more than in 2005. Capital expenditures amounted to $50.7 million, $70.4 million and $97.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The company spent approximately $83.6 million in 2007, $191.9 million in 2006 and $25.4 million in 2005 for the acquisition of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items to augment its existing product lines. These cash expenditures were financed primarily with cash from operations and short term borrowings. Financing activities from continuing operations During 2007, the company used $386.7 million in cash for financing activities from continuing operations, $58.3 million more than in 2006. During 2006, the company used $328.4 million in cash for financing activities from continuing operations, $325.8 million more than in 2005. Cash flow related to financing activities from continuing operations included changes in borrowings, equity proceeds and excess tax benefits related to option exercises, repurchases of company common stock and dividend payments. Total debt was $150.6 million, $150.6 million and $301.4 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total debt to total capitalization was 7.5%, 8.1% and 16.4% at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007, the company spent $422.8 million to purchase 5,115,138 shares of the companys common stock. In 2006, the company spent $201.3 million to purchase 2,787,600 shares of the companys common stock. In 2005, the company spent $143.4 million to purchase 2,200,000 shares of companys common stock. On October 10, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the companys common stock. The company paid cash dividends of $60.1 million, $56.3 million and $52.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The company had no short term borrowings in 2007. In 2006, the average outstanding balance of short term borrowings was approximately $82.0 million with an effective interest rate of 5.33%. At December 31, 2006, all short term borrowings had been repaid. On June 28, 2007, the company amended its existing domestic syndicated bank credit facility with a $400 million five year credit agreement that expires in June 2012. The amended credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. There were no outstanding borrowings or commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In addition, on October 21, 2005, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the company entered into a $250 million syndicated bank credit facility to be used for general corporate needs, including in support of the companys decision in 2005 to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings under the AJCA. Loans under the facility bear interest at the companys option at a fixed spread to LIBOR or the higher of prime rate and 0.50% over the federal funds rate. The facility expires in October 2008. There were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. II 12 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had outstanding approximately $149.8 million of unsecured notes that mature in 2026 and pay a semi annual coupon of 6.70%. The coupon interest closely approximates the effective annual cost of the notes. The market value of the notes approximated $158.3 million at December 31, 2007. Certain of the companys debt agreements contain customary representations, warranties and default provisions as well as restrictions that, among other things, require the maintenance of operating cash flow levels and limit the amount of debt that the company may have outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, the company was in compliance with all such financial covenants. At December 31, 2007, the companys long term debt was rated A by Standard and Poors and Baa1 by Moodys, and the companys commercial paper ratings were A 1 by Standard and Poors and P 2 by Moodys. Commitments and Contingencies Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December 31, 2007. Contractual Obligations (dollars in millions) Total 1Year 2 3Years 4 5Years 5+Years Forward contracts $ 126.5 $ 126.5 $ $ $ Total debt 150.6 0.8 149.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1 Operating lease obligations 123.6 21.1 32.7 22.1 47.7 Acquisition and investment milestones 24.0 6.0 18.0 Purchase obligations 176.6 136.8 25.5 11.6 2.7 Other long term liabilities 108.8 26.2 20.8 61.8 $ 710.2 $ 291.3 $ 102.4 $ 54.5 $ 262.0 The table above does not include $55.3 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $11.7 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of previously unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $20.0 million within twelve months of December 31, 2007 based upon the expiration of statutes of limitations and or the conclusion of tax examinations in several jurisdictions. Forward contracts The company periodically enters into forward contracts and purchases options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Total debt Total debt was $150.6 million at December 31, 2007, consistent with debt balances at December 31, 2006. Total debt was $150.6 million at December 31, 2006, down $150.8 million from December 31, 2005. Total debt to capitalization was 7.5% at December 31, 2007. Total debt to total capitalization was 8.1% at December 31, 2006. Operating lease obligations The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. II 13 Table of Contents Acquisition and investment milestones The company enters into various acquisition and investment arrangements, including research and development arrangements, product and intellectual property acquisitions and business combinations. In connection with some of these activities, the company agrees to make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets. Such payments, when made, are allocated to specific intangible asset categories, assigned to excess of cost over net assets acquired or charged to research and development, depending on the nature of the arrangement. Purchase obligations The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. Other long term liabilities Other long term liabilities include tax, pension liabilities, product liabilities, and other long term liabilities of approximately $175.8 million. Pension Obligations The companys objective in funding its domestic tax qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also take into account each tax qualified plans return compared to the plans corresponding expense and the extent to which each tax qualified plans benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status. In 2007, the company made voluntary contributions of $15.0 million to the companys U.S. tax qualified plan and $6.8 million to the companys non U.S. tax qualified plans. In 2006, the company made voluntary contributions of $12.0 million to the companys U.S. tax qualified plan and $2.6 million to the companys non U.S. tax qualified plans. The company will consider the factors identified above in determining its 2008 pension funding. The nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans include supplemental plans which are generally not funded. Legal Matters On November 27, 2006, the companys Urological Division received a subpoena issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes. The subpoena seeks documents related to the divisions brachytherapy business. The company is cooperating with the governments request and is in the process of responding to the subpoena. At this stage of the inquiry the likelihood of an adverse outcome cannot be assessed. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period. As of February 25, 2008, approximately 580 federal and 280 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 2,135 plaintiffs, as well as nine putative class actions, have been filed or asserted against the company with respect to its Composix&reg; Kugel&reg; product intended for ventral hernia repair (collectively, the Composix Claims). The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the product beginning in December 2005. The actions generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the product and the putative class actions, none of which has been certified, also seek (i) medical monitoring, (ii) compensatory damages, (iii) punitive damages, (iv) a judicial finding of defect and causation and or (v) attorneys fees. On June 22, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred Composix lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Approximately 245 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by approximately 1,465 plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions. The Composix Claims are at a preliminary stage. In the vast majority of these cases, we have not yet obtained and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, we are unable to fully evaluate the claims or determine the time frame in which they may be resolved. As in most litigation of this nature, the Composix Claims present a wide variety of claims, ranging II 14 Table of Contents from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. We believe that many settlements and judgments relating to the Composix claims may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Composix Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the Composix Claims will not have a material adverse impact on the companys result of operations in future periods or the companys financial position or liquidity. For more information, see Risk Factors. On February 21, 2007, Southeast Missouri Hospital filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated against the company and another manufacturer under the caption Southeast Missouri Hospital, et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 1:07 cv 00031, United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern District). The plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendant conspired to exclude competitors from the market and to maintain the companys market share by engaging in conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages. Antitrust damages are subject to trebling. The company intends to defend this matter vigorously. At this time, it is not possible to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period or the companys financial position or liquidity. In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore & Associates Inc.s ePTFE vascular grafts and stent grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135. The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the court is currently assessing Gores assertion that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Because the company considers this matter a gain contingency, no amounts have been recorded as of December 31, 2007. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective as of the beginning of Bards 2008 fiscal year, with the exception of certain provisions deferred until fiscal 2009. The impact of this standard on the companys consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material in 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. FAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of Bards 2008 fiscal year. The company did not elect the fair value option permitted by FAS 159 upon adoption. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R) and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, (FAS 160). FAS 141R requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. FAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. FAS 141R and FAS 160 are effective as of the beginning of Bards 2009 fiscal year. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FAS 141R and FAS 160. II 15 Table of Contents Managements Use of Non GAAP Measures Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non GAAP financial measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result. Revenue recognition The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates, when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Unless agreed otherwise, the companys terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss pass F.O.B. origin. Certain sales to domestic and European distributors are F.O.B. destination. For arrangements where the companys terms state F.O.B. destination, the company records sales on this basis. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out (LIFO) method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. Share Based Compensation The company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Under the fair value provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, option life, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. The risk free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources. The expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates. The companys expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. II 16 Table of Contents This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to the weighted average option life assumption, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. As share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. FAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. Legal Accruals The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for costs related to claims, settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues the minimum amount of the range. The company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities. These positions relate to, among others, transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions as well as other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The company regularly assesses its tax position for such matters and includes reserves for those differences in position. The reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired and or upon the conclusion of the tax examination. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial position or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a future period. Effective January 1, 2007, the company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). See Note 3 Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The company is currently under examination in several tax jurisdictions and remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective tax jurisdiction. Within specific countries, the company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities, or subsidiaries operating within the country may be subject to different statute of limitations expiration dates. As of December 31, 2007, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination in the companys major tax jurisdictions are: United States federal 2003 and forward United States states 2002 and forward Germany 2001 and forward Malaysia 2001 and forward Puerto Rico 2003 and forward United Kingdom 2005 and forward Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation II 17 Table of Contents at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists. It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change. Valuation of Purchased R&D, Goodwill and Intangible Assets When the company acquires another company, the purchase price is allocated, as applicable, between purchased R&D, other identifiable intangible assets, tangible assets and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Purchased R&D is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased R&D and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased R&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. For purchased R&D, these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including purchased R&D, of the acquired businesses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists. The test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The companys estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the companys consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Intangible assets consist primarily of patents, distribution agreements, and other intellectual property, which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 8 to 24 years. The company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable. Pension Plans The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company. II 18 Table of Contents Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. The companys forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward looking statements. In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life sustaining medical devices. These devices are often utilized on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi district litigation proceedings) and other litigation, product withdrawals, Warning Letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to those addressed above and those under the heading Risk Factors, that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to: Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including: the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing process and supply chain programs or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses; the effects of negative publicity concerning our products, which could result in product withdrawals or decreased product demand and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products; the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and successfully integrate such transactions or to obtain agreements for such transactions with favorable terms; the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost containment pressures or preferences for alternate therapies; the ability to maintain or increase research and development expenditures; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales; the ability to maintain our effective tax rate and uncertainty related to tax audits, appeals and litigation; the risk that the company may not successfully implement its new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information system, which could adversely affect the companys results of operations in future periods or its ability to meet the ongoing requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002; II 19 Table of Contents internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales force employees; the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others; changes in factors and assumptions employed in the application of FAS 123R, or actual results that differ from our assumptions on stock valuation and employee stock option exercise patterns, which could cause compensation expense recorded in future periods to differ significantly from the compensation expense recorded in the current period and, as a result, materially impact the companys results of operations; damage to a company facility, which could render the company unable to manufacture one or more products (as the company may utilize only one manufacturing facility for certain of its major products) and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets; the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assets specifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets; and the ability to obtain appropriate levels of product liability insurance on reasonable terms. Competitive factors, including: the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, resulting in potentially greater pricing pressures and more significant and complex contracts than in the past, both in the United States and abroad; development of new products or technologies by competitors having superior performance compared to our current products or products under development which could negatively impact sales of our products or render one or more of our products obsolete; technological advances, patents and registrations obtained by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments or preventing the company from selling a product or including key features in the companys products; attempts by competitors to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs; and reprocessing by third party reprocessors of our products designed and labeled for single use. Difficulties and delays inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products, including: the ability to complete planned clinical trials successfully, to develop and obtain regulatory approval for products on a timely basis and to launch products on a timely basis within cost estimates; lengthy and costly regulatory approval processes, which may result in lost market opportunities; delays or denials of, or grants of low or reduced levels of reimbursement for, procedures using newly developed products; the suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture, market or distribute existing products; the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements, such as those affecting manufacturing and labeling; performance, efficacy or safety concerns for existing products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product withdrawals, recalls, field corrections, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation or declining sales, including adverse events relating to the companys vena cava filters and hernia repair products; II 20 Table of Contents FDA inspections resulting in FDA Form 483 observations and or Warning Letters identifying deficiencies in the companys current good manufacturing practices and or quality systems; Warning Letters which identify violations of FDA regulations that could result in product holds, recalls, restrictions on future clearances by the FDA for products to which the deficiencies are reasonably related and or civil penalties; the failure to obtain, limitations on the use of, or the loss of, patent and other intellectual property rights, and the failure of efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement and legal challenges that can increase our costs; difficulties obtaining necessary components or raw materials used in the companys products and or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components or raw materials or other interruptions of the supply chain; and customers that may limit the number of manufacturers or vendors from which they will purchase products, which can result in the companys inability to sell products to or contract with large hospital systems, integrated delivery networks or group purchasing organizations. Governmental action, including: the impact of continued healthcare cost containment; new laws and judicial decisions related to health care availability, payment for healthcare products and services or the marketing and distribution of products, including legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce or eliminate reimbursements for procedures that use the companys products; changes in the FDA and or foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity; the impact of more vigorous compliance and enforcement activities affecting the healthcare industry in general or the company in particular; changes in the tax or environmental laws or standards affecting our business; changes in the law that could require facility upgrades or process changes and could affect production rates and output; and compliance costs and potential penalties and remediation obligations in connection with environmental laws, including regulations regarding air emissions, waste water discharges and solid waste. Legal disputes, including: disputes over intellectual property rights; product liability claims including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi district litigation proceedings, including with respect to our Composix Kugel products; claims asserting securities law violations; claims asserting, and or subpoenas seeking information regarding, violations of law in connection with federal and or state healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid; derivative shareholder actions; claims and subpoenas asserting antitrust violations; environmental claims, including risks relating to accidental contamination or injury from the use of hazardous materials in the companys manufacturing, sterilization and research activities and the potential for the company to be held liable for any resulting damages; and II 21 Table of Contents commercial disputes, including disputes over distribution agreements, license agreements, manufacturing/supply agreements, development/research agreements and acquisition or sale agreements. General economic conditions, including: international and domestic business conditions; political or economic instability in foreign countries; interest rates; foreign currency exchange rates; and changes in the rate of inflation. Other factors beyond our control, including catastrophes, both natural and man made, earthquakes, floods, fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2007 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $4.6 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $3.8 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis. In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. Note holders had a one time option to redeem the notes at par value on December 1, 2006, and accordingly, the company had classified the notes as current during the 12 month period ending December 1, 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, approximately $0.2 million of the notes were redeemed and the remaining balance of approximately $149.8 million has been reclassified as long term debt. The market value of the notes approximates $158.3 million at December 31, 2007. Assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes would approximate $142.3 million or $176.9 million, respectively, on December 31, 2007. II 22 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. The companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. That report appears on page II 26. II 23 Table of Contents
