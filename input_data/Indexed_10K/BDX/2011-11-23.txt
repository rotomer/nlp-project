Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Company Overview Description of the Company and Business Segments Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices, instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. Our business consists of three worldwide business segments BD Medical (Medical), BD Diagnostics (Diagnostics) and BD Biosciences (Biosciences). Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end users by BD and independent sales representatives. References to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which end on September 30. Strategic Objectives BD remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value, while making appropriate investments for the future. BD management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies: To increase revenue growth by focusing on our core products that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers; To increase investment in research and development for platform extensions and innovative new products; To make significant investments in growing our emerging markets; To improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity; To drive an efficient capital structure and strong shareholder returns. Our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences: Enabling safer, simpler and more effective parenteral drug delivery; Improving clinical outcomes through new, accurate and faster diagnostics; Providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitates the understanding of the cell, cellular diagnostics and cell therapy; Enhancing disease management in diabetes, womens health and cancer, and infection control. We continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles: To maintain a solid investment grade rating; To ensure access to the debt market for strategic opportunities; To optimize the cost of capital based on market conditions. In assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as BDs financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews quarterly forecast data, monthly actual results, segment sales and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows. 19 Table of Contents Financial Results Worldwide revenues in 2011 of $7.8 billion increased 6% from the prior year and reflected volume increases of approximately 4%, estimated favorable foreign exchange translation of 3%, and estimated price decreases of just under 1%, reflecting an ongoing downward trend. Worldwide revenue growth was also negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010, which included strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic, supplemental government spending in Japan and economic stimulus research spending in the U.S. We experienced strong international sales of safety engineered products and strong growth in emerging markets, which was offset, in part, by weaker demand in Western Europe resulting from austerity measures and lower healthcare utilization. Sales in the United States of safety engineered devices grew 1% to $1.12 billion in 2011 from $1.11 billion in 2010. International sales of safety engineered devices grew 21% to $755 million in 2011 from $622 million in 2010, which included an estimated 8% of favorable foreign currency translation. International safety engineered device revenue growth continues to be driven by strong growth in the Medical Segment, with the largest growth in emerging markets, including China and Latin America. The healthcare industry is facing a challenging economic environment. The current economic conditions and other circumstances have resulted in pricing pressures for some of our products, and we expect this downward pricing trend to continue through fiscal year 2012. In addition, healthcare utilization in the U.S. and Western Europe remains constrained due to decreases in government and private healthcare spending, resulting in less demand for our products, and we also expect these conditions to continue into fiscal 2012. We are also experiencing increased raw material costs. Our anticipated revenue growth over the next three years is expected to come from business growth and expansion among all segments and regions of the world, and the development in each business segment of new products and services that provide increased benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers. Our ability to sustain our long term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins across our business segments, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. In addition to the economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere, numerous other factors can affect our ability to achieve these goals including, without limitation, increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives. For example, the U.S. healthcare reform law contains certain tax provisions that will affect BD. The most significant impact is the medical device excise tax, which imposes a 2.3% tax on certain U.S. sales of medical devices, beginning in January 2013. Sales of BD products that we estimate to be subject to this tax represented about 80% of BDs total U.S. revenues in fiscal year 2011. Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operating activities totaling $1.7 billion in 2011. At September 30, 2011, we had $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents and short term investments. In 2011, cash outflows relating to acquisitions included the purchase of Carmel Pharma AB (Carmel Pharma), a Swedish company that manufactures the BD PhaSeal System, a closed system drug transfer device for the safe handling of hazardous drugs that are packaged in vials, for $287 million, net of cash acquired. Cash outflows in 2011 also reflected the acquisition of Accuri Cytometers, Inc. (Accuri) a company that develops and manufactures personal flow cytometers for researchers, for $205 million, net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures were $515 million in 2011 as we continue to invest in capacity across our segments to support future growth. BDs strong cash flow generation also provided the flexibility to continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. During 2011, we repurchased 18.4 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion and paid cash dividends to our shareholders totaling $361 million. In November 2011, we issued $500 million of 5 year 1.75% Notes and $1 billion of 10 year 3.125% Notes, as discussed further below. We face currency exposure each reporting period that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. From time to time, we purchase forward contracts and options to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements. Gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows in fiscal year 2011 or 2012. The favorable impact of 20 Table of Contents foreign currency on revenues for 2011 reflected favorable foreign currency translation and a favorable comparison resulting from hedge losses recognized in 2010. For further discussion refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Results of Continuing Operations Comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2011 and 2010 are affected by the following items that are reflected in our financial results: During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of $9 million, or $0.03 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within the Diagnostic Systems unit. During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded a non cash charge of $9 million, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, related to the elimination of the employer deduction of the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy under the U.S. healthcare reform law. In addition, our 2011 results were unfavorably impacted by the effects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that occurred earlier in the year. For the total fiscal year 2011, these events had an estimated unfavorable impact of about $15 million on revenues, and approximately $0.05 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Medical Segment Medical revenues in 2011 of $4.0 billion increased $211 million, or 5.6%, over 2010, which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 3.3%. The following is a summary of Medical revenues by organizational unit: Estimated Foreign Total Exchange 2011 2010 Change Impact (Millions of dollars) Medical Surgical Systems $ 2,082 $ 2,010 3.6 % 3.2 % Diabetes Care 866 786 10.3 % 3.5 % Pharmaceutical Systems 1,059 1,001 5.8 % 3.4 % Total Revenues* $ 4,007 $ 3,796 5.6 % 3.3 % * Amounts may not add due to rounding. Revenue growth in the Medical Segment reflected strong growth of Pharmaceutical Systems and international safety engineered product sales. Revenues of safety engineered products increased 33.4% internationally, which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 9.7%. Revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit was driven by double digit growth in the United States, Japan and Latin America. U.S. revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit in 2011 was aided by strong sales to companies producing certain generic heparin products. Revenue growth in the Diabetes Care unit resulted primarily from continued strong growth in worldwide pen needle sales. Medical revenues in 2011 also reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period that included strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic primarily in the first half of the year. We estimate that this unfavorable comparison negatively impacted Medicals revenue growth rate by approximately 2.2 percentage points. Medical operating income in 2011 was $1.2 billion, or 29.5% of Medical revenues, as compared with $1.1 billion, or 29.5%, of revenues in 2010. Gross profit margin was higher in the current year than 2010 due to increased sales of products with relatively high gross margins as well as continued manufacturing productivity and lower manufacturing start up costs. These favorable impacts on gross profit margin were partially offset by increases in certain raw material costs and higher pension costs allocated to the Segment. See further discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of 21 Table of Contents Medical revenues in 2011 increased to 17.5% of revenues from 17.3% of revenues in 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Carmel Pharma and unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by continued spending controls. Research and development expenses in 2011 increased $17 million, or 13%, and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms, including new infusion therapy products and new pen needle introductions. Diagnostics Segment Diagnostics revenues in 2011 of $2.5 billion increased $161 million, or 7.0%, over 2010, which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 3.1%. The following is a summary of Diagnostics revenues by organizational unit: Estimated Foreign Total Exchange 2011 2010 Change Impact (Millions of dollars) Preanalytical Systems $ 1,278 $ 1,198 6.7 % 3.0 % Diagnostic Systems 1,203 1,121 7.3 % 3.1 % Total Revenues* $ 2,480 $ 2,319 7.0 % 3.1 % * Amounts may not add due to rounding. Revenue growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit was driven by sales of safety engineered products. Sales of safety engineered products grew 3% in the United States, driven by BD Vacutainertm Push Button Blood Collection Set sales, and 15% internationally, which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 7%. The Diagnostic Systems unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms, including the molecular BD ProbeTectm, BD Vipertm and BD Affirmtm systems, along with solid growth of its BD BACTECtm blood culture and TB systems and the BD Phoenixtm ID/AST platform and its healthcare associated infections (HAI) product offerings. Diagnostics revenues in 2011 also reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period that included strong sales related to the flu pandemic in 2010. We estimate that this unfavorable comparison negatively impacted Diagnostics revenue growth rate by approximately 0.6 percentage points. Diagnostics operating income in 2011 was $636 million, or 25.7% of Diagnostics revenues, compared with $607 million, or 26.2% of revenues, in 2010. Gross profit margin in the Diagnostics segment was relatively flat as compared to the prior year and reflected favorable foreign currency translation, offset by higher raw material costs, primarily resin. See further discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of Diagnostics revenues increased by 30 basis points in 2011 to 21.5%, primarily due to investments in emerging markets and unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by continued spending controls. Research and development expense increased $13 million, or 9% over 2010 and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms, including the BD MAXtm and new BD Vipertm platforms and menus. Biosciences Segment Biosciences revenues in 2011 of $1.3 billion increased $84 million, or 6.7%, over 2010, which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 3.5%. 22 Table of Contents The following is a summary of Biosciences revenues by organizational unit: Estimated Foreign Total Exchange 2011 2010 Change Impact (Millions of dollars) Cell Analysis $ 1,024 $ 951 7.7 % 3.4 % Discovery Labware 317 306 3.6 % 3.6 % Total Revenues $ 1,341 $ 1,257 6.7 % 3.5 % Biosciences revenue growth was primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit. The segments overall revenue growth was affected by slower growth in sales of Discovery Labware products in the U.S. Revenue growth in 2011 was also negatively impacted by approximately 3.6 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010, which included strong sales from U.S. stimulus spending and supplemental spending in Japan. Biosciences operating income in 2011 was $376 million, or 28.1% of Biosciences revenues, compared with $354 million, or 28.2%, in 2010. The Segments operating income in 2011 reflected a higher gross profit margin than 2010 primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and higher margins on service revenue. These favorable variances from the prior year were partially offset by amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of Accuri and increases in certain raw material costs. See further discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and administrative expense was 22.1% in 2011 as compared with 21.9% in 2010 and reflected unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by continued spending controls. Research and development spending increased $11 million or 12% and reflected spending on new products and platforms, including the BD FACS Versetm Analyzer and other next generation cell sorters and analyzers. Geographic Revenues Revenues in the United States in 2011 of $3.4 billion increased 2%. U.S. revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately 2.4 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010, which included strong sales related to the flu pandemic and stimulus spending. The Medical segment experienced strong sales of Pharmaceutical Systems products in the U.S. Diagnostics revenue growth was driven by solid growth in infectious disease and molecular diagnostic platforms. Revenue growth in the Biosciences segment was driven by the Cell Analysis unit, partially offset by lower sales growth of Discovery Labware products. International revenues in 2011 of $4.5 billion increased 9.5%, which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 5.9%. Overall, international growth was driven by sales in emerging markets, with especially strong performance in Asia Pacific and Latin America, which was partially offset by slower growth in Western Europe. International revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 1.5 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010, which included strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic and supplemental spending in Japan. Revenue growth in the Medical Segment was driven by strong sales of safety engineered products. Diagnostic revenue growth reflected solid growth of Womens Health and Cancer products within the Diagnostic Systems unit, as governments are expanding programs for cervical cancer screening in developing markets. Biosciences revenue growth was driven by the Cell Analysis units instrument and reagent sales, primarily in emerging markets. Gross Profit Margin Gross profit margin was 52.3% in 2011, compared with 51.9% in 2010. Gross profit margin in 2011 reflected estimated favorable impacts of 20 basis points relating to foreign currency translation and 30 basis points relating to operating performance. The favorable impact from operating performance resulted from increased sales of products with relatively higher gross margins, increased productivity and lower manufacturing start up costs, which were partially offset by increases in resin and other raw material costs and higher 23 Table of Contents pension costs. Gross profit margin in 2011 was also unfavorably impacted by 10 basis points as a result of the amortization of intangibles associated with the Accuri acquisition. Operating Expenses Selling and administrative expense in 2011 of $1.9 billion, or 23.7% of revenues, increased $130 million, or 8%, compared with $1.7 billion, or 23.3% of revenues, in 2010. Aggregate expenses reflected $46 million of unfavorable foreign exchange and increases in core spending of $53 million, reflecting funding to expand our business in emerging markets and higher shipping costs. Aggregate expenses also reflected a $6 million charge to bad debt expense related to European receivables, increased pension costs of $13 million and higher acquisition related expenses of $6 million. Aggregate expenses for the year also included increased spending of $14 million related to our global enterprise resource planning initiative to update our business information systems. These increases were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in the deferred compensation plan liability, as further discussed below. Research and development (RD) expense in 2011 was $476 million, or 6.1% of revenues, compared with $431 million, or 5.8% of revenues, in 2010. The increase in RD expenditures includes spending for new products and platforms in each of our segments, as previously discussed. RD expense also included a non cash impairment charge of $9 million in 2011 resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within the Diagnostic Systems unit. Non Operating Expense and Income Interest expense in 2011 was $84 million, compared with $51 million in 2010. This increase reflected higher levels of long term fixed rate debt, partially offset by lower average interest rates on the overall long term debt portfolio. Interest income was $43 million in 2011, compared with $35 million in 2010. This increase resulted from higher interest rates and levels of investments outside the United States, net of investment losses on assets related to our deferred compensation plan. The related decrease in the deferred compensation plan liability was recorded as a decrease in selling and administrative expenses. Income Taxes The effective tax rate in 2011 of 26.3% was lower compared with the 2010 rate of 29.2% and reflected a favorable impact of 1.3 percentage points due to certain tax benefits. These benefits resulted from the retroactive extension of the U.S. research tax credit as well as a European restructuring transaction. In addition, the 2010 rate was unfavorably impacted by 0.6 percentage points from the expiration of the RD tax credit, and by 0.5 percentage points from the non cash charge related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. Income and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 were $1.3 billion and $5.59, respectively. The charge related to the discontinuance of a research program decreased income from continuing operations in 2011 by $9 million, or $0.03 per share. 2011 earnings also reflected an overall net favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $0.28 per share. Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 were $1.2 billion and $4.90, respectively. The charge related to healthcare reform decreased income from continuing operations in 2010 by $9 million, or $0.04 per share. Financial Instrument Market Risk We selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk, primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations. The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 24 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk BD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Japan and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. From time to time, we purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future sales resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements. Gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions. Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities. With respect to the derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2011, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar over a one year period would decrease pre tax earnings by $23 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would increase pre tax earnings by $23 million. Comparatively, considering our derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2010, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar over a one year period would have decreased pre tax earnings by $30 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would have increased pre tax earnings by $30 million. These calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments. Interest Rate Risk Our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term U.S. dollar interest rates. Our debt and interest bearing investments at September 30, 2011 are substantially all U.S. dollar denominated. Therefore, transaction and translation exposure relating to such instruments is minimal. When managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are provided by the financial institutions that are counterparties to these arrangements. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities. A change in interest rates on short term debt and interest bearing investments impacts our earnings and cash flow, but not the fair value of these instruments because of their limited duration. A change in interest rates on long term debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the debt, but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on such obligations is fixed. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at September 30, 2011 and 2010, a change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a one year period. An increase of 10% in interest rates would decrease the aggregate fair value of our long term debt and related fair value hedges at September 30, 2011 and 2010 by approximately $90 million and $56 million, respectively. A 10% decrease in interest rates would increase the aggregate fair value of these same financial instruments at September 30, 2011 and 2010 by approximately $96 million and $59 million, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2011 was $1.7 billion, unchanged from 2010. The change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from a net use of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and prepaid expenses. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2010 was reduced 25 Table of Contents by discretionary cash contributions to the U.S. pension plan of $175 million. An additional discretionary cash contribution of $100 million was made to the U.S. pension plan in October 2011. Net Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities Capital Expenditures Our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets. Capital expenditures were $515 million in 2011, compared with $537 million in 2010. Capital spending for the Medical, Diagnostics and Biosciences segments in 2011 was $367 million, $93 million and $37 million, respectively, and related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions. Acquisitions of Businesses Cash outflows relating to acquisitions of $492 million in 2011 were comprised of $287 million associated with the acquisition of Carmel Pharma and $205 million associated with the acquisition of Accuri. For further discussion, refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Net Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities Debt Issuances and Payments of Obligations On November 8, 2010, we issued $700 million of 10 year 3.25% Notes and $300 million of 30 year 5.00% Notes. Short term debt decreased to 9% of total debt at the end of 2011, from 12% at the end of 2010. Floating rate debt was 16% of total debt at the end of 2011 and 24% at the end of 2010. Our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2011 was 4.9%, up from 4.6% at the end of 2010. Debt to capitalization (ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt, shareholders equity and net non current deferred income tax liabilities) at September 30, 2011 was 35.8% compared with 23.7% at September 30, 2010. On November 3, 2011, we issued $500 million of 5 year 1.75% Notes and $1 billion of 10 year 3.125% Notes. The net proceeds from these issuances are expected to be used for repurchases of our common stock and other general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. Repurchase of Common Stock We repurchased approximately 18.4 million shares of our common stock for $1.5 billion in 2011 and 10.1 million shares for $750 million in 2010. In July 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 18 million of our common shares. When combined with the remaining shares under the September 2010 Board of Directors repurchase authorization, a total of approximately 28 million common shares remain available for purchase at September 30, 2011. We plan on share repurchases of $1.5 billion in 2012, subject to market conditions. Such repurchases are expected to be funded primarily by the newly issued debt in November 2011, as discussed further above. Cash and Short term Investments At September 30, 2011, total worldwide cash and short term investments were $1.56 billion, of which $1.34 billion was held in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We regularly review the amount of cash and short term investments held outside the United States and currently intend to use most of such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives. However, if these amounts were moved out of these jurisdictions or repatriated to the United States, there could be tax consequences. 26 Table of Contents Government Receivables Accounts receivable balances include sales to government owned or government supported healthcare facilities. Because these customers are government owned or supported, we could be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or by defaults in these countries. We continually evaluate all government receivables, particularly in Spain, Italy, and other parts of Western Europe, for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. We believe the current reserves related to government receivables are adequate and this concentration of credit risk is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity. Credit Facilities We have in place a commercial paper borrowing program that is available to meet our short term financing needs, including working capital requirements. Borrowings outstanding under this program were $200 million at September 30, 2011. We maintain a $1 billion syndicated credit facility in order to provide backup support for our commercial paper program and for other general corporate purposes. This credit facility expires in December 2012 and includes a single financial covenant that requires BD to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio (ratio of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense) of not less than 5 to 1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters. On the last eight measurement dates, this ratio had ranged from 19 to 1 to 29 to 1. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2011. In addition, we have informal lines of credit outside the United States. Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Our ability to generate cash flow from operations, issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long term capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products, deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions. BDs credit ratings at September 30, 2011 were as follows: Standard Poors Moodys Ratings: Senior Unsecured Debt AA A2 Commercial Paper A 1+ P 1 Outlook Stable Stable Upon review of our plans for the November 2011 debt issuance, Standard Poors lowered BDs Senior Unsecured Debt rating to A+ and its Commercial Paper rating to A 1, while affirming a rating outlook for BD of Stable. At the same time, Moodys affirmed its Senior Unsecured Debt rating of A2 and Commercial Paper rating of P 1, but lowered its rating outlook for BD to Negative. While further deterioration in our credit ratings would increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under its existing credit arrangements, such a downgrade would not affect our ability to draw on these credit facilities, nor would it result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt. We believe that given our debt ratings, our conservative financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the non cyclical, geographically diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short term and long term capital should the need arise. 27 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. The table below sets forth BDs significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments: 2013 to 2015 to 2017 and Total 2012 2014 2016 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Short term debt $ 235 $ 235 $ $ $ Long term debt(A) 4,153 117 432 221 3,383 Operating leases 217 47 74 51 45 Purchase obligations(B) 506 286 184 36 Unrecognized tax benefits(C) Total(D) $ 5,111 $ 685 $ 690 $ 308 $ 3,428 (A) Long term debt obligations include expected principal and interest obligations, including interest rate swaps. The interest rate forward curve at September 30, 2011 was used to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for variable rate debt instruments and swaps. (B) Purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements. (C) Unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2011 of $112 million were all long term in nature. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of these tax positions, the related liability has been excluded from the table. (D) Required funding obligations for 2012 relating to pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. In October 2011, a discretionary cash contribution of $100 million was made to the U.S. pension plan. 2010 Compared With 2009 Results of Continuing Operations Worldwide revenues in 2010 of $7.4 billion increased 5.5% from the prior year and reflected volume increases of approximately 6%, unfavorable foreign exchange translation of 0.1%, inclusive of hedge losses, and price decreases of 0.4%. The increase is attributable to solid revenue growth in the Medical Segment, continued improvement in Biosciences sales and, to a lesser extent, growth in Diagnostics Segment revenues. Comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2010 and 2009 are affected by the following significant items that are reflected in our 2010 financial results: During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded a non cash charge of $9 million, or 4 cents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a tax benefit of $20 million, or 8 cents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, relating to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions. During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded a pre tax charge of $45 million, or 11 cents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, associated with the pending settlement in certain antitrust class action litigation. Medical Segment Medical revenues in 2010 of $3.8 billion increased $239 million, or 6.7%, over 2009, which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 0.5%, net of hedge losses. 28 Table of Contents The following is a summary of Medical revenues by organizational unit: Estimated Foreign Total Exchange 2010 2009 Change Impact (Millions of dollars) Medical Surgical Systems $ 2,010 $ 1,889 6.4 % 1.5 % Diabetes Care 786 715 9.9 % 0.8 % Pharmaceutical Systems 1,001 952 5.1 % (1.3 )% Total Revenues* $ 3,796 $ 3,557 6.7 % 0.5 % * Amounts may not add due to rounding. Revenue growth in the Medical Surgical Systems unit continues to be driven by sales of safety engineered products and prefilled flush syringes. Revenues of safety engineered products increased 5% in the United States and 15% internationally, which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 3%, net of hedge losses. Revenue growth in the Diabetes Care unit resulted primarily from continued strong growth in worldwide pen needle sales and a co marketing agreement in the United States. Revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit was driven by double digit growth in the United States, Japan and Asia Pacific. Revenues related to the H1N1 pandemic grew $15 million to $45 million for the Medical Surgical Systems unit and grew $10 million to $35 million for the Pharmaceutical Systems unit in 2010. Medical operating income in 2010 was $1.1 billion, or 29.5% of Medical revenues, as compared with $1.0 billion, or 29.5%, of revenues in 2009. Favorable manufacturing productivity improvements were substantially offset by a slight decrease in gross profit margin resulting from unfavorable foreign currency translation, a modest increase in the cost of raw materials, and increased manufacturing start up and restructuring costs. See further discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of Medical revenues in 2010 declined to 17.3% of revenues from 17.5% of revenues in 2009, primarily due to continued diligent spending controls. Research and development expenses in 2010 increased $8 million, or 7%, and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms. Diagnostics Segment Diagnostics revenues in 2010 of $2.3 billion increased $93 million, or 4.2%, over 2009, which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 0.2%, net of hedge losses. The following is a summary of Diagnostics revenues by organizational unit: Estimated Foreign Total Exchange 2010 2009 Change Impact (Millions of dollars) Preanalytical Systems $ 1,198 $ 1,143 4.8 % 0.4 % Diagnostic Systems 1,121 1,083 3.5 % Total Revenues $ 2,319 $ 2,226 4.2 % 0.2 % Revenue growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit was driven by sales of safety engineered products. Sales of safety engineered products grew 5% in the United States, driven by BD Vacutainertm Push Button Blood Collection Set sales, and 7% internationally, which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 1%, net of hedge losses. The Diagnostic Systems unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms, including the molecular BD ProbeTectm, BD Vipertm and BD Affirmtm systems, along with solid growth of its BD BACTECtm blood culture and TB systems and the BD Phoenixtm ID/AST platform. Revenues related to the flu pandemic were $13 million in 2010 compared with $22 million in 2009 for the Diagnostic Systems unit. 29 Table of Contents Diagnostics operating income in 2010 was $607 million, or 26.2% of Diagnostics revenues, compared with $607 million, or 27.3% of revenues, in 2009. The Diagnostics segment experienced a decline in gross profit margin that reflected unfavorable foreign currency translation and start up costs associated with acquisitions. This decline was partially offset by sales growth of products that have higher overall gross profit margins, in particular, safety engineered products and the BD ProbeTectm and BD Vipertm systems. See further discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of Diagnostics revenues remained the same in 2010 at 21.2%, due to continued spending controls. Research and development expense increased modestly over 2009 and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms with particular emphasis on our molecular platforms. Biosciences Segment Biosciences revenues in 2010 of $1.3 billion increased $53 million, or 4.4%, over 2009, which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 2.4% due to hedge losses. Biosciences revenues reflected a larger portion of our hedge losses, which are allocated to the segments based on their proportionate share of international sales of U.S. produced products. The following is a summary of Biosciences revenues by organizational unit: Estimated Foreign Total Exchange 2010 2009 Change Impact (Millions of dollars) Cell Analysis $ 951 $ 905 5.2 % (2.6 )% Discovery Labware 306 299 2.2 % (1.4 )% Total Revenues $ 1,257 $ 1,204 4.4 % (2.4 )% Revenue growth in the Cell Analysis unit reflected increased demand for instruments and reagents and was aided by stimulus programs in the U.S. as well as supplemental funding in Japan. Revenue growth in the Discovery Labware unit reflected increased sales to major biopharmaceutical customers, offset by reduced private label sales compared with 2009. Biosciences operating income in 2010 was $354 million, or 28.2% of Biosciences revenues, compared with $362 million, or 30.1%, in 2009. The decrease in operating income, as a percentage of revenues, reflects lower gross profit from the unfavorable impact of hedge losses, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Selling and administrative expense was 21.9% in 2010 as compared with 21.6% in 2009 and reflected new direct selling programs and inflationary factors. Research and development expense increased $10 million, or 11%, and reflected spending on new product development and advanced technology. Geographic Revenues Revenues in the United States in 2010 of $3.3 billion increased 5%. Overall, growth was led by sales of safety engineered products, which increased 5% to $1.11 billion from $1.06 billion in 2009, as well as sales of Diabetes Care products. Revenue growth also reflected sales of immunocytometry instruments and reagents, aided by stimulus programs in the U.S. International revenues in 2010 of $4.1 billion increased 6%, and reflected nominal impact from net foreign currency translation. Sales growth was led by double digit growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Japan. International sales of safety engineered devices grew 9.5% to $622 million in 2010 from $568 million in 2009, which included an estimated impact of net favorable foreign currency translation of 1.4%. Sales growth in Western Europe was unfavorably impacted by continuing adverse macroeconomic conditions and an unfavorable comparison to 2009, which included flu related sales that did not reoccur in 2010. 30 Table of Contents Gross Profit Margin Gross profit margin was 51.9% in 2010, compared with 52.6% in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 reflected an estimated unfavorable impact primarily from hedging activity of 90 basis points. Partially offsetting these losses was a net favorable operating performance impact of 20 basis points. Operating performance reflected higher sales of products with higher gross margins, partially offset by higher manufacturing start up and restructuring costs, higher pension costs, and increases in certain raw material costs. Operating Expenses Selling and administrative expense in 2010 of $1.7 billion, or 23.3% of revenues, increased $41 million, or 2%, compared with $1.7 billion, or 24.1% of revenues, in 2009. This increase reflected $32 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Increased spending in 2010 included $18 million in core spending, $16 million related to our global enterprise resource planning initiative to update our business information systems, and $15 million in pension costs. Aggregate expenses for 2009 reflected the $45 million litigation charge previously discussed. Research and development (RD) expense in 2010 was $431 million, or 5.8% of revenues, compared with $405 million, or 5.8% of revenues, in 2009. The increase in RD expenditures includes spending for new products and platforms in each of our segments, as previously discussed. Non Operating Expense and Income Interest expense in 2010 was $51 million, compared with $40 million in 2009. This increase reflected higher levels of long term fixed rate debt, partially offset by lower interest rates on floating rate debt and a benefit from higher levels of capitalized interest. Interest income was $35 million in 2010, compared with $33 million in 2009. This increase resulted primarily from higher investment levels. Other income (expense), net in 2010 included the gain recognized on the sale of the extended dwell catheter product platform of $18 million and a write down of investments of $14 million. Income Taxes The effective tax rate in 2010 of 29.2% was higher compared with the 2009 rate of 26.1% and reflected the unfavorable impact of certain unusual items. The 2010 rate was unfavorably impacted by 0.6 percentage points from the expiration of the RD tax credit, and by 0.5 percentage points from the non cash charge related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. In addition, the 2009 rate reflected a 1.2 percentage point benefit due to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions. Income and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 were $1.2 billion and $4.90, respectively. The non cash charge related to healthcare reform decreased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 by $9 million, or 4 cents, respectively. The current years earnings also reflected an overall net unfavorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations of 26 cents, including hedge losses. Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 were $1.2 million and $4.73, respectively. The tax benefit discussed above increased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by $20 million, or 8 cents, respectively. The litigation charge discussed above decreased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by $28 million, or 11 cents, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2010 was $1.7 billion, unchanged from 2009. The change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from a net use of cash and reflected higher levels of accounts 31 Table of Contents receivable and inventory. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was reduced by discretionary cash contributions to the U.S. pension plan of $175 million and $75 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities Capital expenditures were $537 million in 2010, compared with $585 million in 2009. Capital spending for the Medical, Diagnostics and Biosciences segments in 2010 was $369 million, $109 million and $50 million, respectively, and related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions. Cash outflows relating to acquisitions of $281 million in 2010 primarily related to a cash outflow of $275 million associated with the acquisition of HandyLab, Inc. For further discussion refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. On July 30, 2010, the Company sold the Ophthalmic Systems unit and the surgical blades platform. The sale of the critical care and extended dwell catheter product platforms was completed on September 30, 2010. Cash proceeds received in the fourth quarter 2010 from these divestitures were $260 million, net of working capital adjustments. For further discussion refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Net Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities The change in short term debt reflected the repayment of $200 million of 7.15% Notes, due October 1, 2009, using the proceeds from the issuance of $500 million of 10 year, 5.00% Notes and $250 million of 30 year, 6.00% Notes in May 2009. Short term debt decreased to 12% of total debt at the end of 2010, from 21% at the end of 2009. Floating rate debt was 24% of total debt at the end of 2010 and 32% at the end of 2009. Our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2010 was 4.6%, down from 4.9% at the end of 2009. Debt to capitalization (ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt, shareholders equity and net non current deferred income tax liabilities) at September 30, 2010 was 23.7% compared to 26.8% at September 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from managements estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is typically recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; product price is fixed or determinable; and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. For certain instruments sold from the Biosciences segment, we recognize revenue upon installation at a customers site, as installation of these instruments is considered a significant post delivery obligation. For certain sales arrangements, primarily in the U.S., with multiple deliverables, revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the completion of each deliverable: shipment, installation and training. These sales agreements are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is recognized upon the completion of 32 Table of Contents each deliverable based on its relative selling price. The relative selling prices of installation and training are determined based on the prices at which these deliverables would be regularly sold on a standalone basis. The relative selling prices of instruments are based on estimated selling prices. These estimates represent the quoted sales contract price in each arrangement. BDs domestic businesses sell products primarily to distributors who resell the products to end user customers. We provide rebates to distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined under a contract between BD and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, which are based on historical information for all rebates that have not yet been processed, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is recognized. Impairment of Assets Goodwill and in process research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including core and developed technology, and other long lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our 2011 annual impairment assessment, we identified six reporting units. Potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment test for 2011 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. We generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BDs business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset, and potentially result in different impacts to BDs results of operations. Actual results may differ from managements estimates. Income Taxes BD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry back and carry forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. BD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BDs effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. At September 30, 2011, the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the United States was $3.8 billion. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized 33 Table of Contents deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. Contingencies We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability, antitrust and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third party recoveries). A determination of the amount of accruals, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and, when appropriate, is developed after consultation with outside counsel. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. Accordingly, in the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BDs consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows. Benefit Plans We have significant net pension and other postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Other postretirement benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion. The discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). For the U.S. pension plan, we will use a discount rate of 4.9% for 2012, which was based on an actuarially determined, company specific yield curve. The rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the measurement date and for calculating the following years pension expense. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.75% for the U.S. pension plan in 2012. We believe our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans are as follows: Discount rate A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $8 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost. Expected return on plan assets A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan cost. 34 Table of Contents Share Based Compensation Compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method. All share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense (based on their fair values) over the vesting period of the awards. We determine the fair value of certain share based awards using a lattice based binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions, such as the risk free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements BD and its representatives may from time to time make certain forward looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as plan, expect, believe, intend, will, anticipate, estimate and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance, as well as our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position and expenditures. All statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including statements relating to volume growth, sales and earnings per share growth, cash flows or uses, and statements expressing views about future operating results are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The forward looking statements are, and will be, based on managements then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations. The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. The current conditions in the global economy and financial markets, and the potential adverse effect on the cost of operating our business, the demand for our products and services, prices for our products and services due to increases in pricing pressure, or our ability to produce our products, including the impact on developing countries. Also, the increase in sovereign debt during the financial crisis as a result of governmental intervention in the world economy poses additional risks to the global financial system and economic recovery. We sell to government owned or government supported healthcare and research facilities, and any governmental austerity programs or other adverse change in the availability of government funding in these countries, particularly in Western Europe, could result in less demand for our products and additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales. The consequences of the healthcare reform in the United States, which implemented an excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices, and which could result in reduced demand for our products, increased pricing pressures or otherwise adversely affect BDs business. Future healthcare reform in the countries in which we do business may also involve changes in government pricing and reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms. Changes in domestic and foreign healthcare industry practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among 35 Table of Contents healthcare providers and trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment (including changes in reimbursement practices by third party payors). Our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets, which also depends on economic and political conditions and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation, and fluctuations in interest rates and, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, and the potential effect on our revenues, expenses, margins and credit ratings. New or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation (including tax reforms that could adversely impact multinational corporations), sales practices, price controls and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the postmarketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD. Product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product recalls, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or foreign counterparts, declining sales and product liability claims, particularly in light of the current regulatory environment, including increased enforcement activity by the FDA. Competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions (for example, new forms of drug delivery) by our current or future competitors, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low cost manufacturers as certain competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers in low cost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), and new entrants into our markets. The effects of events that adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products (particularly where production of a product line is concentrated in one or more plants) or our ability to source materials or components from suppliers that are needed for such manufacturing, including pandemics, natural disasters, environmental factors or cyber attacks. Fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain sub assemblies and finished goods, the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to sole source suppliers), and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items. Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process (including potential 510(k) reforms) may also delay product launches and increase development costs. Fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise. 36 Table of Contents Fluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research. Our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales. Our earnings forecasts are based on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others. Our ability to implement our ongoing upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system, as any delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our upgrade could adversely affect our business. Pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings adverse to BD, including antitrust claims, product liability claims and patent infringement claims, and the availability or collectibility of insurance relating to any such claims. The effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BDs business or operations, including the effect on BDs reputation or demand for its products. The effects, if any, of governmental and media activities regarding the business practices of group purchasing organizations, which negotiate product prices on behalf of their member hospitals with BD and other suppliers. The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BDs pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense. Political conditions in international markets, including civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders and expropriation of assets by a government, including the recent civil unrest in parts of the Middle East. The impact of business combinations, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquired in process research and development assets, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire. Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake. Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission. The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Notes 1, 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and is incorporated herein by reference. 37 Table of Contents
