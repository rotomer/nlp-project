ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Net Sales Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2002 2001 2000 Home products $2,532.2 $2,068.8 $2,088.1 Spirits and wine 1,032.5 1,368.0 1,227.3 Golf products 1,007.6 946.5 965.2 Office products 1,105.4 1,176.3 1,354.8 Net Sales $5,677.7 $5,559.6 $5,635.4 Net Income Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2002 2001 2000 Operating Company Contribution(1): Home products $ 416.6 $ 316.7 $ 339.6 Spirits and wine 285.1 306.0 309.1 Golf products 132.6 131.3 145.2 Office products 69.6 50.1 79.5 Less: Other Operating Expenses(2) 117.3 272.8 695.6 Operating Income $ 786.6 $ 531.3 $ 177.8 Less: Interest and related expenses 74.1 96.8 133.8 Other income, net (43.7) (57.4) Income taxes 214.2 94.4 176.6 Minority interests 16.4 11.5 5.1 Net Income $ 525.6 $ 386.0 $ (137.7) (1) Operating company contribution (OCC) is net sales less all costs and expenses other than restructuring and restructuring related charges, write downs of identifiable intangibles and goodwill, amortization of intangibles, corporate administrative expense, interest and related expenses, other (income) expense, net, income taxes and minority interests. OCC, which is not a measure under generally accepted accounting principles, is one of the key measures by which we gauge the underlying operating performance of our business segments. We use this and other measures to allocate capital resources, evaluate acquisitions and dispositions and evaluate and identify cost reduction initiatives. OCC should not be considered as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This measure may differ from similar measures presented by other companies depending upon which items other companies include. (2) Other operating expenses represent the sum of corporate administrative expense, intangible amortization and restructuring and restructuring related charges. CONSOLIDATED Fortune Brands, Inc. is a holding company with subsidiaries that manufacture or produce and sell leading consumer branded products in the following industries: home products, spirits and wine, golf equipment and office products. It earns cash and profits by building its consumer brands to grow sales, including the development of new products and effective marketing campaigns and improving its productivity and cost structure. It strives to enhance shareholder value by strategically positioning its businesses to achieve higher growth and higher returns, including through acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures and through other 18 shareholder value initiatives such as using its financial resources to repurchase shares and pay attractive dividends. The Companys net income increased 36% in 2002 due primarily to the benefit of the acquisition of the Omega Group cabinet company and strong operating performance. Management considers 2002 to have been a very successful year for Fortune Brands, especially given uneven economic conditions in its primary markets. Management believes the Company is well positioned in 2003 to meet its long term goals of increased returns and double digit EPS growth, excluding any special charges or gains. In 2003, the Company may confront continued economic uncertainty and may be adversely impacted by increased expenses for pension, post retirement benefit plans and insurance. The Companys operating units will also face both challenges and opportunities unique to their industries, as discussed in this report. 2002 Compared to 2001 NET SALES Net sales increased $118.1 million, or 2%, to $5.7 billion. Sales benefited from the acquisition of Omega Holdings, Inc., a U.S. based manufacturer of custom and semi custom cabinetry, increased volumes with the introduction of new products and line extensions, principally in the golf products business, and favorable foreign exchange of $20 million. These benefits were partly offset by lower volumes in certain existing product lines in the golf and office products businesses, the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in October 2001, the absence of ABSOLUT revenues recorded on an interim basis in 2001 and five fewer selling days in 2002 for the cabinets business due to the use of the 53 week and 52 week business calendar in consecutive years. The percentage increase in net sales would have been higher if the net impact of revenues for the U.K. based Scotch whisky business and the sales of ABSOLUT vodka recorded on an interim basis in 2001, as well as the benefit of the Omega acquisition in 2002, were excluded. COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD Cost of products sold decreased $53.7 million, or 2%, due to positive operating leverage and cost reductions. EXCISE TAXES ON SPIRITS AND WINE Excise taxes on spirits and wine decreased $49.3 million, or 14%. The decrease was principally due to the absence of the ABSOLUT revenues recorded on an interim basis in 2001 and the absence of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in 2002. The Companys spirits and wine business incurs federal excise taxes in the U.S., and in addition to the U.S., had incurred excise taxes in the United Kingdom for the first nine months of 2001 prior to the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business. ADVERTISING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $85.2 million, or 6%, on higher advertising and marketing expenditures and pension expense, partially offset by cost savings achieved from the Future Brands LLC joint venture established in June 2001 and our restructuring actions and other cost containment initiatives across all of our operations, particularly in our office products business. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES Amortization of intangibles decreased $46.6 million, or 74%, due to the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142) as of January 1, 2002. WRITE DOWN OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL In 2002, we did not record a write down of either identifiable intangibles or goodwill. In 2001, we did record a non cash write down identifiable intangibles of $73.3 million, $67.1 million after tax (44 cents basic and 43 cents diluted per share). The write down recognized the diminished fair values of select identifiable intangibles resulting from the structuring of office products and the consolidation of non core tradenames in 19 home products. The write down by business segment were: office products $64.4 million; and home products $8.9 million. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $45.9 million ($29.8 million after tax). The charges principally related to planned workforce reduction costs, asset write offs and costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, principally in the office products business, and the sale of certain non strategic product lines in the home products and spirits and wine businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $45.4 million ($29.8 million after tax). These charges principally related to product line discontinuances, expenses associated with the exploration of strategic options and planned workforce reduction initiatives across the operations of the office products business, lease cancellation costs in the specialty plumbing parts business and capacity reductions in select technology platforms in the golf products business. INTEREST AND RELATED EXPENSES Interest and related expenses decreased $22.7 million, or 23%. This decrease primarily reflected lower average borrowings as we repaid short term debt using proceeds received from V&S and from the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business and increased operating cash flow as well as lower interest rates, partially offset by commercial paper borrowings used to finance the Omega cabinets acquisition. OTHER INCOME, NET Other income, net decreased $13.7 million to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 due principally to (1) the absence of the $16.6 million gain on the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business and (2) lower interest income on a tax receivable in 2002 as compared to 2001. The significant components of other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: (IN MILLIONS) 2002 2001 Reconciliation of 2002 and 2001 other income, net Amortization of deferred income $27.0 $15.8 Interest income on tax receivable 14.9 28.5 Gain on sale of U.K. based Scotch whisky business 16.6 Other miscellaneous items 1.8 (3.5) Total $43.7 $57.4 INCOME TAXES Income taxes increased $119.8 million, or 127%. The reported effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were 28.3% and 19.2%, respectively. The increase was principally due to the higher operating income and lower interest and related expenses partially offset by the tax credit of $61.7 million recorded in June 2002. The effective income tax rate comparison was impacted by the recognition, during the second quarter of 2002, of a $61.7 million tax credit resulting from new IRS regulations that reinterpret the capital loss disallowance rules. The new regulations now enable us to utilize a capital loss incurred in 1994 to offset capital gains taxed in 1996 and 1997. The other factors affecting the effective income tax rate comparison include: interest on the $61.7 million tax credit of $14.9 million ($9.6 million after tax); the reversal of a $31.0 million tax reserve for the years 1990 through 1992 in the second quarter of 2001; and the $72.9 million net tax benefit recognized as a result of the recapitalization of the office products business in the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding these tax related items, the effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were 36.5% and 37.9%, respectively. This lower effective tax rate principally reflects lower goodwill amortization related to the adoption of SFAS 142. 20 MINORITY INTERESTS Minority interests increased $4.9 million, or 43%, principally on the recognition of five additional months of preferred dividends payable to V&S, on their 10% interest in JBBW, in 2002 as compared to 2001. NET INCOME Net income of $525.6 million, or $3.51 basic and $3.41 diluted per share, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with net income of $386.0 million, or $2.55 basic and $2.49 diluted per share, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in net income of $139.6 million was principally due to the higher sales, the lower cost of sales, lower intangible amortization and interest and related expenses, partly offset by higher income taxes, increased advertising and marketing expenditures and higher pension expense. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes the following net gains and charges: the recognition of a $61.7 million tax credit and related interest income of $14.9 million ($9.6 million after tax) and the $55.8 million ($36.2 million after tax) in restructuring and restructuring related charges. In addition, net income for the year ended December 31, 2001, includes the following net gains and charges: the recognition of a $72.9 million net tax benefit and related interest income of $28.5 million ($17.3 million after tax); the reversal of a $31.0 million tax reserve that was no longer required; the $16.6 million ($21.8 million after tax) gain on the sale of the U.K based Scotch whisky business; the $98.1 million ($63.3 million after tax) of restructuring and restructuring related charges; and the $73.3 million ($67.1 million after tax) write down of certain identifiable intangibles. On a periodic basis, we evaluate the assumptions used in determining our pension liabilities and assets as well as pension expense based upon historical returns on plan assets and current economic conditions at the time the assumptions are set. We initially reexamined in December 2001 the economic assumptions that underlie determination of our pension expense and year end disclosure. This review led to a reduction in both our weighted average discount rate from 7.2% to 7.0% and weighted average expected rate of return from 9.6% to 8.3%. These revisions led to an increase in pension expense of approximately $15 million to $21.9 million in 2002. Once again, in late 2002, we reviewed our economic assumptions and lowered our weighted average discount rate from 7.0% to 6.6% for 2003. Our weighted average expected return on plan assets remained unchanged at 8.3%. Our management believes that these assumptions are appropriate. The 2002 revisions will result in an increase to our pension expense of approximately $10 to $15 million in 2003. In addition, we expect in 2003 to provide cash contributions of approximately $30 million to fund existing pension liabilities for our qualified defined benefit plans. Additional cash contributions in 2003 will be required as benefits are paid for our various supplemental defined benefit plans. In 2002, our total defined benefit plan cash contributions were $16.4 million. We derived approximately 21% of our 2002 and 22% of our 2001 operating company contribution from international markets, principally the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies may affect results in future periods. Fluctuations in average foreign exchange reduced 2002 operating company contribution by approximately 1%. We cannot accurately predict fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. A 10% change in average exchange rates for the foreign currencies from 2002 average rates would have resulted in a change in operating company contribution of approximately $19 million, or about 2%. Pending Litigation TOBACCO LITIGATION AND INDEMNIFICATION On December 22, 1994, the Company sold ATCO subsidiary to B&W, a wholly owned subsidiary of B.A.T Industries p.l.c. In connection with the sale, B&W and ATCO, which has since merged into B&W (the Indemnitor), agreed to indemnify the Company against claims including legal expenses arising from smoking and health and fire safe cigarette matters relating to the tobacco business of ATCO. The Indemnitor has 21 complied with the terms of the indemnification agreement since 1994 and the Company is not aware of any inability on the part of the Indemnitor to satisfy its indemnity obligations. The Company is a defendant in numerous actions based upon allegations that human ailments have resulted from tobacco use. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the pending litigation. However, management believes that there are a number of meritorious defenses to the pending actions, including the fact that the Company never made or sold tobacco, and these actions are being vigorously contested by the Indemnitor. Management believes that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company because it believes it has meritorious defenses and the Company is indemnified under the previously mentioned indemnification agreement. OTHER LITIGATION There is an increasing volume of asbestos related personal injury litigation in the United States generally. A subsidiary of the Company, Moen Incorporated, has been named as a defendant in approximately 110 cases claiming personal injury from asbestos. All of these suits name multiple defendants and, in most cases, in excess of 75 defendants are named in addition to Moen. None of these cases identify any Moen products or premises as the cause of the alleged injury to any of the plaintiffs identified. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Management believes it has meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company. These actions are being vigorously contested. In addition to the lawsuits described above, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits associated with their business and operations. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Management believes that there are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company. These actions are being vigorously contested. Environmental Matters Along with other responsible parties, our subsidiaries face claims relating to the protection of the environment. As of February 13, 2003, various of our subsidiaries had been designated as potentially responsible parties under "Superfund" or similar state laws in 58 instances. We have reached settlements in 40 of these instances. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other responsible parties or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we have accrued $50.6 million and $51.7 million, respectively, to cover these matters. Related Party Transactions FUTURE BRANDS, LLC In 2001, the Companys spirits and wine business completed transactions with Vin & Sprit AB of Sweden creating a joint venture, named Future Brands LLC, to distribute both companies spirits and wine brands in the United States. As part of forming this joint venture, our spirits and wine business has, in the event of default of Future Brands, a continuing obligation to satisfy any financial obligations of Future Brands that may arise in the event that Future Brands fails to fulfill its operating obligations and which results in a claim. These financial obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, JBBCo. did not have any outstanding obligations as a result of this arrangement. JBBCo.s transactions with Future Brands amounted to: sales of $515.6 million and $498.7 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, accounts receivable of $68.8 million and $92.0 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, accounts payable of $15.6 million and $23.7 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and an investment of 22 $11.7 million and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, the Company had accrued liabilities with Future Brands amounting to $29.1 million and $4.5 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. MAXXIUM INTERNATIONAL BV In 1999, the spirits and wine business formed an international sales and distribution joint venture named Maxxium International B.V. with Remy Cointreau and Highland Distillers, which began operating in August 1999, to distribute and sell spirits in key markets outside the United States. As a result of forming this joint venture, JBBW has guaranteed certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $66 million, of which $57 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2001, the guarantees totaled $55 million, of which $48 million was outstanding. JBBW has also executed a Shareholder Loan Facility (Loan Facility) with Maxxium. There were no amounts outstanding under the Loan Facility as of either December 31, 2002 or December 31, 2001. The Loan Facility expires December 31, 2003. JBBCo.s transactions with Maxxium included the following: sales of $179.1 million, $168.2 million and $160.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, accounts receivable of $34.6 million and $39.5 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, accounts payable of $12.3 million and $6.1 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and an investment of $64.3 million and $63.0 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 (SFAS 145), "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections." This Statement rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements." This Statement requires gains and losses from debt extinguishments that are used as part of the Companys risk management strategy to be classified as income from operations rather than as extraordinary items, net of tax. The Company will apply the provisions of SFAS 145 prospectively to all debt extinguishments beginning in 2003. On July 30, 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 146 (SFAS 146), "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by SFAS 146 include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing or other exit or disposal activity. SFAS 146 also supercedes, in its entirety, previous accounting guidance that was provided by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company will apply the provisions of SFAS 146 prospectively to exit or disposal activities beginning in 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." The interpretation expands on the accounting guidance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 5, 57 and 107 and incorporates without change the provisions of FIN No. 34, which is superceded. The interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees, such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair or market value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. 23 The Company will apply the initial recognition and measurement provisions on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified in 2003. In addition, the Company has applied the disclosure requirements for its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." The objective of FIN 46 is to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities. Prior to FIN 46, companies generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. FIN 46 changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk or loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. Consolidation by a primary beneficiary of the assets, liabilities and results of activities of variable interest entities will provide more complete information about the resources, obligations, risks and opportunities of the consolidated company. Critical Accounting Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" requires all registrants, including the Company, to include a discussion of "critical" accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Trade receivables are stated less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations, usually due to customers potential insolvency or early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns was $65.8 million and $61.0 million as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. Alternatively, if we provided an allowance of 0.50% for net sales to customers for cash discounts and returns and allowances and 2% of our year end customer receivables for doubtful accounts, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns would have been approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. INVENTORIES Inventories are priced at the lower of cost (principally first in, first out and average, with minor amounts at last in, first out) or market. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice, bulk whiskey inventories are classified as current assets, although the majority of such inventories, due to the duration of aging processes, ordinarily will not be sold within one year. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided, principally on a straight line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses resulting from dispositions are included in income. Betterments and renewals, which improve and extend the life of an asset, are capitalized; maintenance and repair costs are expensed. Estimated useful lives of the related assets are as follows: Buildings and improvements to leaseholds 5 to 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 12 years LONG LIVED ASSETS In accordance with our adoption, in January 2002, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (SFAS 144), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets," a long lived asset or asset group 24 is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows. The discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on the Companys weighted average cost of capital, which represents the blended after tax costs of debt and equity. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have any impact on the Company. INTANGIBLES In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." We adopted the requirements under SFAS 142 as of January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and under certain circumstances, and written down when impaired, rather than amortized as previous standards required. In addition, SFAS 142 requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as it was deemed that these tradenames are currently anticipated to contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite lived intangible assets will not be amortized, but are required to be evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. The rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital, risk adjusted where necessary. Estimated cash flows are then determined by disaggregating our business segments to a reporting level for which meaningful identifiable cash flows can be determined. When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangibles) and related goodwill, impairment losses of goodwill are charged to operations. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the sum of the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangibles) and goodwill over the discounted cash flows of the business being evaluated. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. In accordance with this accounting policy, during the fourth quarter of 2000, we recorded a non cash write down of goodwill of $502.6 million, $487.3 million after tax ($3.09 per share) for office products. This action resulted from the significant shortfall in office products earnings, the softening conditions in the office products industry and the ongoing repositioning process, which led to the implementation of additional restructuring plans. In conjunction with our ongoing review of the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," in December 2001, the Company recorded a non cash write down of identifiable intangibles of $73.3 million, $67.1 million after tax (44 cents basic and 43 cents diluted per share). The write down recognized the diminished fair values of select identifiable intangibles resulting from the restructuring of office products and the consolidation of non core tradenames in home products. The write downs by business segment were: office products $64.4 million and home products $8.9 million. WARRANTY RESERVES We offer our customers various warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold. In addition, we do not offer extended warranty terms on any of the products we sell. 25 A reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of warranty reserves for the year ended December 31, 2002 is as follows: Dollar Amount of Liability (IN MILLIONS) Debit/(Credit) Balance as of January 1, 2002 $ (8.0) Accruals for warranties issued during 2002 (60.9) Acquisitions (0.5) Settlements made (in cash or in kind) during 2002 60.2 Balance as of December 31, 2002 $ (9.2) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, post retirement, post employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As required by United States generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of our modifications are generally recorded and amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries. We will continue to monitor these assumptions as market conditions warrant. We expect pension expense of approximately $32 million to $37 million and post retirement benefit expense of approximately $10 million to $15 million in 2003. A 25 basis point (i.e., 0.25%) change in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension expense and post retirement benefit expense of approximately $3 million and $1 million, respectively, for 2003. REVENUE RECOGNITION In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, we recognize revenue as products are shipped to customers, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. We also provide for our estimate of potential bad debt at the time of revenue recognition. Amounts billed for shipping and handling are classified in "net sales" in the consolidated income statement. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are classified in "advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses." CUSTOMER PROGRAM COSTS We generally recognize customer program costs in either "net sales to customers" or the category "advertising, selling and general and administrative expenses" at the time the program is initiated and or the revenue is recognized. The costs generally recognized in "net sales to customers" include, but are not limited to, general customer program generated expenses, cooperative advertising programs, volume allowances, shared media and promotional allowances. The costs generally recognized in "advertising, selling and general and administrative expenses" include point of sale materials and store service fees. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION We apply Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the stock option plans. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure," requires disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share amounts as if compensation expense was recognized. For the required disclosure, SFAS 148 allows the use of a fair value method to measure compensation expense. Accordingly, we have adopted the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine our compensation expense for disclosure purposes. The model requires the use of the following assumptions: an expected dividend yield; 26 expected volatility; risk free interest rate; and expected term. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $11.63, $8.91 and $6.15, respectively, per option. Based upon the range provided for the assumptions utilized, any alternative fair values per option would not have materially differed from the fair values listed above. Derivative Financial Instruments Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and its related amendment Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 (SFAS 138), "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities." These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 on January 1, 2001 was not material. Derivative gains or losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. During each of the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, $0.6 million in deferred gain amounts were reclassified to cost of sales. The Company estimates that $1.1 million of derivative loss included in OCI as of December 31, 2002 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Certain forecasted transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Pound sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. INTEREST RATE RISK We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. The swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amounts. We record the payments or receipts on the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements. Cost Initiatives We continuously evaluate the productivity of our product lines and existing asset base and actively seek to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure. Future opportunities may involve, among other things, the reorganization of operations or the relocation of manufacturing or assembly to locations generally having lower costs. Implementing any significant cost reduction and efficiency opportunities could result in charges. 2001 Compared to 2000 NET SALES Net sales decreased $75.8 million, or 1%. The decrease was principally caused by volume declines in certain existing product lines, primarily in the office, home and golf segments, the sale of the U.K. based private label Scotch business in October 2001 as well as unfavorable foreign exchange ($72 million). These factors were partly offset by the introduction of new products and line extensions and higher average selling prices. Additionally, as a result of the establishment of V&S new U.S. subsidiary as the exclusive importer of V&S products, revenues under the interim distribution agreement were no longer recorded by our spirits and wine business as of January 1, 2002. The percentage decrease in net sales would have been greater if the net impact of the revenues recorded under the interim distribution agreement with V&S in 2001 and revenues for the U.K. private label Scotch business in either 2001 or 2000 were excluded. COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD Cost of products sold increased $39.3 million, or 1%, due to substantial adverse operating leverage in our office products business. 27 EXCISE TAXES ON SPIRITS AND WINE Excise taxes on spirits and wine increased $7.7 million, or 2%. This increase was due principally to an increase in bourbon volumes in the United States and the impact of revenues recorded under the interim distribution agreement with V&S, and were partly offset by the absence of U.K. excise taxes for the final three months of 2001 following the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in October 2001. ADVERTISING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $55.8 million, or 4%, on cost savings achieved from the Future Brands joint venture established in June 2001 and our restructuring actions and other cost containment initiatives across all of our operations, particularly in our office products business. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES Amortization of intangibles decreased $16.9 million, or 21% due to the write down in December 2000 of goodwill in our office products business. WRITE DOWN OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL In 2001, we did record a non cash write down of identifiable intangibles of $73.3 million, $67.1 million after tax (44 cents basic and 43 cents diluted per share). The write down recognized the diminished fair values of select identifiable intangibles resulting from the restructuring of office products and the consolidation of non core tradenames in home products. The write downs by business segment were: office products $64.4 million; and home products $8.9 million. In 2000, we recorded a non cash write down of goodwill of $502.6 million, $487.3 million after tax ($3.09 per share) for office products. This action resulted from the significant shortfall in office products earnings, the softening conditions in the office products industry and the ongoing repositioning process, which led to the implementation of additional restructuring plans. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $45.4 million ($29.8 million after tax). These charges principally related to product line discontinuances, expenses associated with the exploration of strategic options and planned workforce reduction initiatives across the operations of the office products business, lease cancellation costs in the specialty plumbing parts business and capacity reductions in select technology platforms in the golf products business. For the year ended December 31, 2000, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $19.7 million ($12.5 million after tax). These charges principally related to planned employee termination costs, asset write offs and lease cancellation costs. INTEREST AND RELATED EXPENSES Interest and related expenses decreased $37.0 million, or 28%. This decline primarily reflected lower interest rates in 2001 and the repayment of debt using proceeds received from V&S and from the sale of the U.K. private label Scotch business. OTHER INCOME, NET Other income, net increased from zero to $57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 due principally to (1) the amortization of deferred income recognized as a result of the contribution of assets to the Future Brands LLC joint venture (2) the interest income on a tax receivable and (3) the gain on the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business. The significant components of other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: (IN MILLIONS) 2001 2000 Reconciliation of 2001 and 2000 other income, net Amortization of deferred income $15.8 $ Interest income on tax receivable 28.5 Gain on sale of U.K. based Scotch whisky business 16.6 Other miscellaneous items (3.5) Total $57.4 $ 28 INCOME TAXES Income taxes decreased $82.2 million, or 47%. The decrease was due principally to the $72.9 million net tax benefit recognized as a result of the recapitalization of the office products business and a $31.0 million tax reserve reversal. The effective income tax rate comparison was distorted primarily by the absence of tax benefits on the write down of goodwill, and the recognition of a net tax benefit and prior year tax reserve reversal. Excluding these items, the effective income tax rates were 37.9% for 2001 and 40.4% for 2000. MINORITY INTERESTS Minority interests increased $6.4 million to $11.5 million on the sale in June 2001 of a 10% minority interest in our spirits and wine business to V&S and the recognition of preferred dividends payable to V&S in 2001. NET INCOME Net income in 2001 of $386.0 million, or $2.55 basic and $2.49 diluted per share, compared with a net loss of 137.7 million, or 88 cents per share, for 2000. The higher net income was attributable to the absence of a write down of goodwill in 2001 and lower income taxes. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes the following net gains and charges: the recognition of a $72.9 million net tax benefit recognized as a result of the recapitalization of the office products business, a $31.0 million tax reserve reversal, the $28.5 million ($17.3 million after tax) interest income on the tax refund, the $16.6 million ($21.8 million after tax) gain on the sale of the U.K. private label Scotch business, the $98.1 million ($63.3 million after tax) restructuring and restructuring related charges and a $73.3 million ($67.1 million after tax) writedown of identifiable intangibles. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a non cash write down of identifiable intangibles of $73.3 million, ($67.1 million after tax, or 44 cents per basic and 43 cents per diluted share). The write down recognized the diminished fair values of select identifiable intangibles resulting from the restructuring of office products and the consolidation of tradenames in home products. The write downs by business segment were: office products $64.4 million and home products $8.9 million. We reported increases in deferred income and minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 as compared with December 31, 2000. The change in deferred income arose from the payment of $270 million from V&S to gain access to our spirits and wine businesss U.S. distribution network and to acquire a 49% interest in Future Brands. This amount will be amortized to other (income) expenses, net on a straight line basis over the next ten years as JBBCo. has, in the event of a default of Future Brands, continuing operating obligations including, but not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which the joint venture has contracts. The change in minority interest resulted from the payment in June 2001 of $375 million from V&S to acquire a 10% equity interest in our spirits and wine business in the form of convertible preferred stock. In December 2001, we recapitalized our office products business through the sale of a minority interest of less than 1% of our common shares in the business to a passive investor. The transaction allowed us to access a capital tax loss that offset other gains, resulting in a net tax benefit of $72.9 million, or 48 cents per basic and 47 cents per diluted share. An additional sale of our common shares in this business was completed in January 2002. Coupled with common shares sold in December, we recognized a minority interest of less than 2% in the business. Additionally, the transaction resulted in a substantial capital tax loss, which carries forward and will be realized in the event that the Company has qualified taxable capital gains. On October 16, 2001, the Company announced that its spirits and wine business sold its U.K. based Scotch whisky business for $280 million in cash. The sale of the business consisted of the Invergordon private label and bulk Scotch operations and several regional brands in the U.K. The products included in the agreement generated sales of approximately $235 million (including excise taxes). The Company also recorded an after tax gain of $21.8 million, or 15 cents per basic and 14 cents per diluted share. 29 HOME PRODUCTS 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales improved $463.4 million, or 22%, to $2.5 billion as a result of the acquisition of Omega Holdings, Inc. and strong underlying sales growth reflecting share gains and a robust building and remodeling market. Underlying sales growth also benefited from new product introductions and line extensions and higher volumes in certain existing product lines, primarily cabinets and Moen faucets. Partially offsetting these benefits were increased rebates and five fewer selling days in 2002 for the cabinets business, due to the use of the 53 week and 52 week business calendar in consecutive years, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange of $2 million. Operating company contribution increased $99.9 million, or 32%, to $416.6 million. The higher operating company contribution resulted from the acquisition of Omega Holdings, Inc., higher underlying sales across all of our home businesses, positive operating leverage, and ongoing cost and productivity gains. In April 2002, the home products business acquired Omega, a U.S. based manufacturer of custom and semi custom cabinetry. This acquisition broadens our cabinet product line and is providing additional selling opportunities across customers, while producing purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies. The cost of this acquisition was $538 million. As a result of the acquisition of Omega, the home products business recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangibles of $349.9 million and $212.0 million, respectively. The $212.0 million of other identifiable intangibles consists of $138.5 million of indefinite lived tradenames and $73.5 million of customer relationship intangibles which are amortized over a weighted average useful life of approximately 15 years. Management expects that our home products business will benefit from its strength in the home improvement market and expected long term growth in the net number of U.S. households and in new home and apartment construction. The continued consolidation of the customer base in the home products industry and increased price competition will continue to present challenges to us and our competitors. Customer consolidation will also present opportunities for the most innovative and efficient manufacturers. Our home products business may be impacted by the continued uncertain U.S. economic outlook and its potential impact on the U.S. housing and remodeling markets. 2001 Compared to 2000 Net sales decreased $19.3 million, or 1%, on lower volumes in certain existing product lines, particularly tool storage, higher rebates as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($6 million). These factors were largely offset by the introduction of new products and line extensions and higher average selling prices. Our results were tempered by the events of September 11 and the weak economy, including wholesale inventory reductions in the faucet segment. Operating company contribution decreased $22.9 million, or 7%. The decrease in operating company contribution resulted from adverse operating leverage, specifically associated with the specialty plumbing parts unit, which was exiting a significant portion of its low margin retail business, higher operating expenses and unfavorable product mix. This decrease was partly offset by higher average selling prices and savings from outsourcing initiatives. SPIRITS AND WINE 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales decreased $335.5 million, or 25%, to $1.0 billion principally due to the divestiture of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in October 2001, and sales of ABSOLUT vodka no longer recorded on an interim basis in 2002. These factors were partially offset by higher average selling prices for Jim Beam bourbon and 30 DeKuyper products, increased sales of Beam ready to drink products in Australia and of premium and superpremium products in the U.S., and favorable foreign exchange of $9 million. Net sales would have increased if the net impact of sales of ABSOLUT recorded on an interim basis and revenues for the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in 2001 were excluded. With the establishment of the U.S. subsidiary of V&S as the exclusive importer of V&S products, revenues and expenses under the interim arrangement were no longer recorded by our spirits and wine business beginning February 1, 2002. Operating company contribution decreased $20.9 million, or 7%, to $285.1 million, as a result of the absence of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in 2002. In addition, other factors impacting this decrease were increased brand advertising and support costs, specifically for our premium and superpremium brands in the U.S. and After Shock liqueur in the U.K., lower sales of bulk wine, lower cooperage income from the sale of used oak barrels, and lower sales of After Shock in the U.K. These factors were partly offset by lower distribution costs in the United States as a result of the Future Brands joint venture established in June 2001 and the higher comparable sales as well as favorable foreign exchange ($6 million). On May 31, 2001, the Companys spirits and wine business completed transactions with V&S creating a joint venture named Future Brands to distribute over an initial ten year period both companies spirits and wine brands in the United States. The Companys spirits and wine business has accounted for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting. Pursuant to EITF 96 16, Future Brands is not consolidated into our spirits and wine business as V&S has substantive participating rights which preclude consolidation. V&S paid $270 million to gain access to our spirits and wine businesss U.S. distribution network and to acquire a 49% interest in Future Brands, and paid $375 million to purchase a 10% equity interest in JBBW in the form of convertible preferred stock. The shares of JBBW convertible preferred stock issued to V&S are convertible into 10% of the JBBW common stock and have voting power equivalent to a 10% interest in JBBW common stock. The preferred stock is entitled to a dividend equal to the greater of 10% of the dividend paid upon JBBW common stock or 3% of the preferred stocks face value ($375 million) plus unpaid accrued dividends; no dividends may be paid on common stock unless all unpaid accrued JBBW preferred stock dividends have been paid. V&S also received a 3 year option to increase its equity stake in JBBW by up to an additional 9.9%. V&S may require the Company to purchase the JBBW preferred stock at fair value in whole or in part at any time after May 31, 2004, or upon a change in control of JBBW, JBBCo., or certain other events. The Company has accounted for the $270 million gain on the sale of 49% of Future Brands as deferred income and the resulting tax on sale as a deferred income tax asset due to certain continuing obligations of JBBCo., including, but not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts in the event of a default of Future Brands. In June 2001, the Company began amortizing these amounts to other income and income taxes on a straight line basis over the initial term of the agreement. The 10 year amortization period is based on the non cancelable 10 year term of the management agreement for Future Brands. In addition to the investment in Future Brands, V&S invested 107 million Euros (approximately $90 million) to acquire a 25% interest in Maxxium. As a result of this investment by V&S, our spirits and wine business received an $8.2 million dividend from Maxxium, which reduced its investment in the joint venture. Management expects that our spirits and wine business will benefit from growth in the premium and super premium spirits market, and has focused its product development and marketing activities on those segments. Negative factors that may affect results include the possibility of excise tax increases or increased regulation. In addition, results could be impacted by the continued trend towards consolidation of the supplier, distributor and retailer tiers in the highly competitive spirits and wine business. Continued consolidation may present pricing and service challenges for our spirits and wine business and its competitors. It may also present opportunities, particularly for the most efficient and innovative competitors. 2001 Compared to 2000 Net sales increased $140.7 million, or 11%, principally as a result of ABSOLUT vodka revenues recorded by the spirits and wine business on an interim basis pending establishment of V&S U.S. subsidiary, as well as volume increases in certain existing product lines and an increase in average selling prices in our Jim Beam bourbon and 31 DeKuyper product lines. The volume increases included gains in our Jim Beam pre mix product in Australia, cordials in the United Kingdom and premium and super premium product lines in the United States. These benefits were partially offset by lower average foreign exchange rates during the year ($21 million). The percentage increase in net sales would have been lower if the revenues recorded under the interim distribution agreement with V&S and the U.K. private label Scotch business for the fourth quarter of 2000 were excluded. Operating company contribution decreased $3.1 million, or 1%, due to the sale of the U.K. private label Scotch business in October 2001, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($8 million). This decrease was partly offset by the higher average selling prices and volume increases in certain existing product lines (as noted above) and lower selling costs as a result of the Future Brands joint venture, as discussed above. Reported operating company contribution would have increased had we excluded the impact of the U.K. private label Scotch business in the fourth quarter of 2000 and foreign exchange. GOLF PRODUCTS 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales increased $61.1 million, or 6%, to $1.0 billion due to successful new products and line extensions, particularly in golf clubs, partly offset by lower volumes in certain existing product lines and favorable foreign exchange of $0.6 million. Operating company contribution increased $1.3 million, or 1%, to $132.6 million on the higher sales, partly offset by increased marketing spending to support new product initiatives and a more challenging pricing environment. Management believes our golf products business will benefit by the increasing attraction of golf to maturing baby boomers and long term low single digit growth in U.S. rounds of play. Competitors with significant brand awareness have introduced golf balls into their product offerings in the past four years and the golf ball industry has experienced increased price competition, partially as a result of such introductions. Largely as a result of the introduction of the new Titleist Pro V1, Titleist NXT and Pinnacle golf balls, our golf ball business has recovered U.S. market share initially lost to new competitors during 2000. The ability of the Companys golf business to maintain and increase revenues will depend upon continued strong innovation and marketing, including the promotion of its products by professional golfers. The United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A) establish standards for golf equipment used in the United States and outside the United States, respectively. On August 6, 2002, the USGA and R&A announced a joint decision to unify the rule relating to golf club head performance. The USGA will retain its current Coefficient of Restitution limit of .830. Beginning in 2003, the R&A will adopt the .830 limit for its Open Championship and in 2008 for all play in R&A jurisdictions. All Acushnet Company products currently conform to the USGA and R&A regulations. Each of the USGA and the R&A has proposed new rules addressing the overall distance standard for golf balls, golf club head size and golf club shaft length. Until more details regarding such potential rule changes become available, we cannot determine whether they would have a material effect on our golf products business and or the golf products industry. 2001 Compared to 2000 Net sales decreased $18.7 million, or 2%, principally due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($18 million). In addition, the business experienced lower volumes in certain existing golf club, golf shoe and golf glove product lines and price competition largely offset by an increase in golf ball volumes and the introduction of new products across all product lines. Sales were adversely affected by a 1% decline in rounds played, soft economic conditions and a decline in destination travel after the events of September 11. 32 Operating company contribution decreased $13.9 million, or 10% on the lower sales, the discontinuance of certain product lines and unfavorable foreign exchange ($3 million). These conditions were partially offset by reduced operating expenses. OFFICE PRODUCTS 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales decreased $70.9 million, or 6%, to $1.1 billion, primarily due to lower volumes in the United States and Europe. Approximately half of the sales decrease was due to the full year effect of discontinued product lines resulting from initiatives to refocus the business around its core product categories. The balance of the sales decrease was caused primarily by weakness in the U.S. and European economies, a sales decrease in our paper based time management business and price reductions related to a mix shift to private label products. In addition, a decrease in the number of office workers negatively impacted the demand for the businesss products. The introduction of new products, improved product mix, lower customer rebates and favorable foreign exchange of $12 million partly offset the decrease in net sales. Operating company contribution improved $19.5 million, or 39%, to $69.6 million reflecting the substantial cost savings achieved by the business restructuring actions and its focus on its most profitable product categories. The office products industry is increasingly concentrated in a small number of major customers, principally office products superstores, large retailers, wholesalers and contract stationers. Customer consolidation and growth of private label products continue to increase pricing pressures, presenting challenges to our office products group and its competitors. We decided, in April 2001 not to divest our office products business due to weakness in the overall economy that has particularly impacted the office products industry. We are currently repositioning and restructuring the business to improve both financial results and the long term value of the business. Under this plan, our office products group is realigning and streamlining its worldwide operations, intensifying its focus on growing profitable core product categories, divesting or discontinuing non strategic and low return product categories and reducing overhead expenses and excess capacity. As a result of this plan, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we recorded total after tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of $26.4 million ($40.1 million pre tax) to complete the first phase of our repositioning program and initiate the final phase of our office products repositioning. Once completed, this restructuring action will have reduced the size of the business manufacturing and distribution facilities by approximately one third; and we also expect it will provide significant cost savings. These actions have already provided significant working capital improvements. We expect to record additional after tax charges of $25 to 30 million ($40 to $50 million pre tax) to complete this final phase. The overall office products repositioning program will continue to be self funding within the office products business. 2001 Compared to 2000 Sales decreased $178.5 million, or 13%, resulting principally from lower volumes in the United States across all product categories, including discontinuing certain unprofitable product lines, and lower average foreign exchange rates ($27 million). In addition, U.S. and European economic softness and demand weakness caused by corporate layoffs, coupled with ongoing inventory reductions by major customers have prolonged industry wide volume challenges. These factors were partially offset by the introduction of new products, higher selling prices for select products, favorable product mix and reduced customer rebates due to the lower volumes. Operating company contribution decreased $29.4 million, or 37%. The lower operating company contribution was primarily attributable to the lower sales, substantial adverse operating leverage as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($2 million). In addition, unfavorable foreign exchange adversely impacted gross margins due to higher purchase costs. This decrease was partly offset by reduced operating expenses and savings achieved 33 as a result of restructuring initiatives. These restructuring initiatives resulted in a one third reduction in headcount since the beginning of 2000, including 1,200 positions in 2001.

(2) In 2002, net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share reflected restructuring and restructuring related charges of $3.2 million ($2.2 million after tax, or one cent per share) (See Note 15), in the first quarter; restructuring and restructuring related charges of $19.5 million ($12.9 million after tax, or eight cents per share) (See Note 15), a tax benefit of $61.7 million recognized as a result of new IRS regulations, issued in March 2002, that reinterpret the capital loss disallowance rules and enabled the Company to utilize a tax loss incurred in 1994 to offset capital gains in 1996 and 1997 (41 cents basic and 40 cents diluted per share) (See Note 13), and interest income on the tax benefit of $14.9 million ($9.6 million after tax, or six cents per share) (See Note 13), in the second quarter; restructuring and restructuring related charges of $22.2 million ($14.3 million after tax, or ten cents basic and nine cents diluted per share) (See Note 15), in the third quarter; and restructuring and restructuring related charges of $10.9 million ($6.8 million after tax, or five cents per share) (See Note 15), in the fourth quarter. (3) Net sales and gross profit have been restated to conform to the 2002 presentation due to the reclassification of certain expenses previously included in selling and general and administrative expenses in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01 09. For 2001, the restatement resulted in a reduction in net sales amounting to $29.6 million in the first quarter; $28.0 million in the second quarter; $29.6 million in the third quarter; and $31.9 million in the fourth quarter. (See Note 1.) (4) In 2001, net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share reflected restructuring and restructuring related charges of $42.3 million ($27.8 million after tax, or 18 cents per share) (See Note 15) and a $31.0 million tax reserve reversal, or 20 cents per share, in the second quarter (See Note 13); and restructuring and restructuring related charges of $55.8 million ($35.5 million after tax, or 24 cents basic and 23 cents diluted per share) (See Note 15), a net tax benefit of $72.9 million recognized as a result of the recapitalization of the office products business (49 cents basic and 48 cents diluted per share) (See Note 3), a write down of identifiable intangibles of $73.3 million ($67.1 million after tax or 45 cents basic and 44 cents diluted per share) (See Note 1), interest income on tax refund of $28.5 million on tax refund ($17.3 million after tax, or 12 cents basic and 11 cents diluted per share) (See Note 13) and the gain from the sale of the U.K. private label Scotch business of $16.6 million ($21.8 million after tax, or 15 cents basic and 14 cents diluted per share) (See Note 4), in the fourth quarter. 34 FINANCIAL CONDITION CASH FLOW DATA Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was $787.0 million compared with $638.7 million in 2001. The principal reasons for the increase were the higher net income in 2002 and improvements in working capital management. For the year ended December 31, 2002, free cash flow of $447.2 million represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, net, and dividends to stockholders. Free cash flow is expected to decrease to approximately $250 million to $300 million in 2003 due to the return to a more normalized cash flow and increased capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2001, free cash flow was $286.7 million. Net Cash (Used) Provided by Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $600.8 million, as compared with net cash provided of $339.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES We focus our capital spending on growth initiatives and becoming the lowest cost producers of the highest quality products. Capital expenditures in 2002 were $194.3 million as compared with $207.3 million in 2001. This includes $4.9 million in 2002 related to restructuring activities (principally land and buildings related to relocation of certain operations to Mexico). We currently estimate 2003 capital expenditures will be approximately $230 million. We expect to generate these funds internally. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES In the second quarter of 2002, our home products business acquired Omega Holdings, Inc. for cash of $433.0 million. In addition, in the third quarter of 2002, we received proceeds of $3.8 million on the sale of a non strategic product line in our spirits and wine business, and, in the fourth quarter, we received net proceeds of $14.8 million for the sale of the specialty plumbing parts business in our home products segment. In 2001, our spirits and wine business entered into the Future Brands joint venture and received proceeds totaling $270 million from V&S for the assets contributed; and received proceeds totaling $280 million from the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business. In addition, the spirits and wine business acquired long term distribution rights for its super premium tequila brands in 2001 for $6.5 million. In 2000, our spirits and wine business invested $25.6 million in its Maxxium joint venture toward its total investment of $110 million. Net Cash Used by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $219.1 million, as compared with $952.8 million in 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we increased short term debt borrowings, net ($122.5 million), which were partly offset by the redemption of Omega debt securities with a principal amount of $100 million, repurchased $271.1 million (5,729,400 shares repurchased) of our common stock and received proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($135.4 million), which increased because the volume of option exercises was higher in 2002 than the year before. DIVIDENDS We paid common dividends in 2002 of $1.02 per share. Dividends paid to common stockholders in 2002 increased to $152.7 million from $147.2 million in 2001 as the increase in our dividend offset the lower shares outstanding. With the December 2, 2002 dividend payment, we increased the common stock quarterly dividend by 8% to $.27 per share, or an indicated annual rate of $1.08 per share. 35 FINANCIAL POSITION At December 31, 2002, total debt increased $146.4 million to $1.1 billion. Short term debt increased $123.5 million and long term decreased $108.6 million, as we reclassified our $106.9 million 8 1/2% Notes, due in October 2003, to current liabilities. Our total debt to total capital ratio increased to 29.5% at December 31, 2002 from 28.4% at December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily a result of commercial paper borrowings used to finance the Omega cabinets acquisition. At December 31, 2002, $1 billion of debt securities were available for public sale under our shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At December 31, 2002, we maintained two credit facilities, which we entered into in 2001 and 2002. Such agreements include a $750 million 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement, which expires in 2006, and a $500 million 364 Day Revolving Credit Agreement, which expires in 2003 and includes the option to extend payment for one year at our discretion for an incremental fee of .25% of the outstanding amount. These facilities are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and to support our short term borrowings in the commercial paper market. We believe that our internally generated funds, together with access to global credit markets, are adequate to meet our capital needs. Working capital decreased $353.2 million to $388.4 million at December 31, 2002. Increased short term debt (reflecting the reclassification of our $106.9 million 8 1/2% Notes, due October 2003, to current liabilities and increased commercial paper borrowings used to finance the Omega acquisition) as well as decreased cash and inventories was the principal reasons for the reduction, partly offset by lower accounts payable. We believe that our 2002 working capital level was adequate to support continued growth. FOREIGN EXCHANGE Our subsidiaries have investments in various foreign countries, principally the United Kingdom, as well as Australia and Canada. Therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect our balance sheet and cash flow statements when translated into U.S. dollars. Interest Rates We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. The swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount. We record the payments or receipts on the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements. Interest rates on our total indebtedness are primarily fixed. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our $974.6 million and $951.7 million total long term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $1,094.3 million and $980.3 million, respectively. The fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased $8.1 million principally due to the completion, in January 2002, of the second of two transactions to sell shares in our wholly owned office products business. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Stockholders equity at year end 2002 increased $210.5 million principally due to our higher net income. We purchased, through open market purchases, 5.7 million and 7.5 million shares of common stock during 2002 and 2001, respectively. 36 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table and discussion represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2002. (IN MILLIONS) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2002 Less than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Short term borrowings $ 161.3 $ 161.3 $ $ $ Long term debt 974.6 132.9 200.6 0.1 641.0 Capital lease obligations 1.5 0.8 0.7 Operating leases 230.5 48.9 102.0 18.2 61.4 Other long term obligations 0.2 0.2 Total $1,368.1 $ 344.1 $ 303.3 $ 18.3 $ 702.4 In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2002. These include the guarantee of certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $66.0 million, which expires in less than one year; a Shareholder Loan Facility executed by JBBW and Maxxium amounting to $15.7 million, for which no amounts were outstanding and which expires in less than one year; Standby Letters of Credit of $64.1 million of which $61.4 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $2.7 million due in one to three years; and Surety Bonds of $19.2 million which were due in less than one year. In addition, V&S holds an option which may require us to repurchase JBBW preferred stock at fair value in whole or in part any time after May 31, 2004 or upon a change in control of JBBW, JBBCo., or certain other events. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. In addition to the obligations described above, JBBCo., a subsidiary of the Company, in the event of the default of Future Brands, is required to satisfy certain of Future Brands financial obligations. These obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. 37 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. MARKET RISK We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The counterparties are major financial institutions. Foreign Exchange Contracts We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Financial instruments are principally used to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The principal financial instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The counterparties are major financial institutions. Although our theoretical risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments, management believes that the risk of incurring losses is remote and that such losses, if any, would be immaterial. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions. We periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investments in foreign operating companies. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value at risk (VAR) computation to estimate the potential economic loss that we could incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The VAR estimations are intended to measure the maximum amount of our loss from adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates, given a specified confidence level, over a given period of time. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques. The estimated fair value loss shown in the table below does not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. Also, the use of the VAR model should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The following table summarizes our estimated loss under the VAR model as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. (IN MILLIONS) Estimated Amount of Loss Period Confidence Level 2002 foreign exchange $0.4 1 day 95% 2001 foreign exchange $0.3 1 day 95% The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of all outstanding contracts and the contract amounts were essentially the same. Commodities We are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. While we do use futures contracts to manage the volatility of pricing for certain commodities, the exposures are not considered material to our financial statements. 38
