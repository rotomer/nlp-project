Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Net Sales Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Home and hardware $ 2,899.9 $ 2,532.2 $ 2,068.8 Spirits and wine 1,091.0 1,032.5 1,368.0 Golf 1,121.7 1,007.6 946.5 Office 1,101.9 1,105.4 1,176.3 Net Sales $ 6,214.5 $ 5,677.7 $ 5,559.6 Net Income Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Home and hardware $ 481.3 $ 398.5 $ 250.7 Spirits and wine 302.8 276.3 285.7 Golf 139.1 129.8 124.1 Office 57.6 27.4 (90.3 ) Less: Corporate expenses 63.3 45.4 38.9 Operating Income $ 917.5 $ 786.6 $ 531.3 Less: Interest expense 73.8 74.1 96.8 Other income, net (40.7 ) (43.7 ) (57.4 ) Income taxes 289.2 214.2 94.4 Minority interests 16.0 16.4 11.5 Net Income $ 579.2 $ 525.6 $ 386.0 Consolidated Summary Fortune Brands, Inc. is a holding company with subsidiaries that make and sell leading consumer branded products in the following industries: home and hardware, spirits and wine, golf equipment and office products. We generate cash and earn profits by building our leading consumer brands to grow sales. We attempt to do this by developing new products, increasing demand with effective marketing campaigns, and expanding our market share by developing and expanding customer relationships. We also seek to increase profits by improving operations to enhance productivity and cost structures. While our first priority is internal growth, we also strive to achieve higher growth and higher returns through acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. Finally, we aim to enhance shareholder value through other initiatives such as using our financial resources to repurchase shares and pay attractive dividends. We believe that 2003 was an excellent year of broad based success for Fortune Brands. The Companys net income in 2003 increased 10% to $579.2 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $3.86. This increase in profits was due primarily to the benefit of strong operating performance, aided by favorable foreign exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions. The Companys net sales increased 9.5% to $6.2 billion, as a result of increased sales of new products, extensions of existing product lines, acquisitions, favorable foreign exchange and higher average selling prices. 17 Table of Contents As indicated below, each of our segments achieved solid performance in 2003: Our Home & Hardware business achieved strong double digit growth in both operating income (21%) and sales (15%), resulting from sustained sales gains in kitchen and bath cabinets, the full year consolidation and growth of Omega, the acquisition of Therma Tru, successful line extensions and new product introductions, as well as productivity improvements. Our Spirits & Wine business achieved 10% growth in operating income and 6% growth in sales, due to favorable foreign exchange, growth of international sales of ready to drink products, selected price increases in the U.S. and higher sales of cordials and super premium spirits. With successful advanced technology new products, our Golf brands vastly outperformed the industry, achieving 11% growth in sales, significant share gains and a 7% increase in operating income. Our Office business achieved 110% growth in operating income despite flat sales, benefiting from successful cost reduction and asset management initiatives as well as favorable foreign exchange. In 2004, the Company is well positioned for another year of excellent performance. Management believes the Company will benefit from the following trends in its businesses: Long term demographics of the home improvement and housing industries, particularly the kitchen and bath segment; continued growth of the spirits and wine market, especially the premium and super premium segments; and effect of continued favorable foreign exchange on sales and profits. The Company has also identified the following risks and challenges that may impact its business: Potential reductions in the number of rounds of play on overall golf ball demand; potential impact of changes in interest rates on the housing market; impact of increases in commodity costs, particularly fuel and steel costs; weak conditions in the leisure travel industry on our Golf and Spirits & Wine businesses; continued consolidation of the Companys trade customers, particularly in the Office and Home & Hardware businesses; and increased competition by private label products. 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales Net sales increased $536.8 million, or 9.5%, to $6.2 billion. Sales benefited principally from increased volume associated with line extensions and the introduction of new products in our Golf and Home and Hardware businesses ($241 million in aggregate), acquisitions ($220 million) including Omega in 2002 and favorable foreign exchange ($137 million). These benefits were partly offset by lower volumes in some existing product lines in the Office business, as well as the divestiture of the non strategic plumbing parts business of Home and Hardware in November 2002 ($53 million). Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $127.9 million, or 9%, on increased support for cabinet growth, golf marketing costs and commissions on higher sales. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles increased $2.8 million, or 17%, due to the full year amortization of finite lived intangibles for the 2002 Omega acquisition. Write down of identifiable intangibles We recorded a write down of identifiable intangibles of $12.0 million ($8.0 million after tax) to recognize the diminished values of certain trade names in conjunction with our repositioning plans in our Office business. 18 Table of Contents Restructuring charges In 2003, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $19.5 million ($13.8 after tax). These charges principally related to the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities and employee termination costs in the Office business ($17.3 million pre tax), as well as the consolidation of ball plant facilities in the Golf business ($2.2 million pre tax). Of the $19.5 million in restructuring charges, $11.5 million related to disposal of assets, $6.9 million to employee terminations costs and $1.1 million to termination of lease agreements. Other income, net Other income, net, decreased $3.0 million to $40.7 million. The components of other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: (In millions) 2003 2002 Reconciliation of 2003 and 2002 other income, net Amortization of deferred income $ 27.0 $ 27.0 Interest income on tax receivable 10.7 14.9 Other miscellaneous items 3.0 1.8 Total $ 40.7 $ 43.7 Income taxes Income taxes increased $75.0 million, or 35%, as we recorded a lower tax related gain in 2003 compared with 2002. The reported effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were 32.7% and 28.3%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was affected by the following items. During 2003, the audit of our 1993 1996 tax returns resulted in a reduction in tax expense of $35 million after recording a $29 million tax receivable and a net decrease to tax reserves of $6 million. During 2002, we recorded a $61.7 million tax credit which resulted from new IRS regulations that reinterpreted the capital loss disallowance rules. The new regulations enabled us to utilize a previously disallowed capital tax loss to offset capital gains taxed in 1996 and 1997. In addition, the 2003 effective rate was affected by non deductible non cash restructuring and restructuring related charges. Net income Net income increased $53.6 million, or 10%, to $579.2 million due primarily to strong broad based operating performance, the benefit of favorable foreign exchange ($23 million), lower restructuring charges ($16 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($15 million), in part offset by lower tax related gains than 2002 ($35.0 million in 2003 compared to $61.7 million in 2002). Diluted earnings per share were $3.86 in 2003, up 13% from 2002. Earnings per share benefited from higher net income and our share repurchase program. Pension Plans On a periodic basis, we evaluate the assumptions used in determining our pension liabilities and assets as well as pension expense based on historical returns on plan assets and current economic conditions at the time the assumptions are set. Our December 2002 review of the economic assumptions underlying our pension expense and year end disclosure led to a reduction in our weighted average discount rate from 7.0% to 6.6%. The weighted average expected rate of return remained unchanged at 8.3%. The 2002 revisions led to an increase of approximately $3 million in our pension expense to $28.1 million in 2003. Our December 2003 review of the economic assumptions led to a reduction in our weighted average discount rate from 6.6% to 6.1%. The weighted average expected rate of return remained unchanged at 8.3%. Management believes that these assumptions are appropriate. The 2003 revisions will result in an increase to our pension expense of approximately $5 million in 2004. 19 Table of Contents In 2003, our total pension plan cash contributions were $123.5 million. In 2004 we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $50 75 million to fund existing pension liabilities for our defined benefit plans. International Performance We derived approximately 28% of our 2003 and 22% of our 2002 operating income from international markets, principally the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The increase in the portion of operating income attributable to international markets resulted partly from the benefit of foreign exchange as well as higher restructuring related charges in the U.S. in 2003. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies may affect results in future periods. Fluctuations in average foreign exchange rates increased 2003 operating income by approximately 4%. We cannot accurately predict fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. A 10% change in average exchange rates for the foreign currencies from 2003 average rates would have resulted in a change in operating income of approximately $20 million, or about 2%. Pending Litigation Tobacco Litigation and Indemnification On December 22, 1994, the Company sold the ATCO subsidiary to B&W, a wholly owned subsidiary of B.A.T Industries p.l.c. In connection with the sale, B&W and ATCO, which has since merged into B&W (the Indemnitor), agreed to indemnify the Company against claims including legal expenses arising from smoking and health and fire safe cigarette matters relating to the tobacco business of ATCO. The Indemnitor has complied with the terms of the indemnification agreement since 1994 and the Company is not aware of any inability on the part of the Indemnitor to satisfy its indemnity obligations. The Company is a defendant in numerous actions based upon allegations that human ailments have resulted from tobacco use. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the pending litigation. However, management believes that there are a number of meritorious defenses to the pending actions, including the fact that the Company never made or sold tobacco, and these actions are being vigorously contested by the Indemnitor. Management believes that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company because it believes it has meritorious defenses and the Company is indemnified under the previously mentioned indemnification agreement. Other Litigation There is an increasing volume of asbestos related personal injury litigation in the United States generally. A subsidiary of the Company, Moen Incorporated, has been named as a defendant in approximately 160 cases claiming personal injury from asbestos. All of these suits name multiple defendants and, in most cases, in excess of 75 defendants are named in addition to Moen. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Management believes it has meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company. These actions are being vigorously contested. In addition to the lawsuits described above, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits associated with their business and operations. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Management believes that there are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company. These actions are being vigorously contested. Environmental Matters Along with other responsible parties, our subsidiaries face claims relating to the protection of the environment. As of February 17, 2004, various of our subsidiaries had been designated as potentially responsible parties under Superfund or similar state laws in 59 instances. We have reached settlements in 40 of these instances. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other responsible parties or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we have accrued $48.5 million and $50.6 million, respectively, to cover these matters. 20 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions Future Brands, LLC In 2001, the Companys spirits and wine business completed transactions with V&S Vin & Sprit AB (V&S) creating the Future Brands joint venture, which distributes both companies spirits brands in the United States and provides related selling and invoicing services. Future Brands receives a commission from the partners for services provided. As part of forming this joint venture, JBBCo. has, in the event of default of Future Brands, a continuing obligation to satisfy any financial obligations of Future Brands that may arise in the event that Future Brands fails to fulfill its operating obligations and which results in a claim. These financial obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, JBBCo. did not have any outstanding obligations as a result of this arrangement. JBBCo.s balances related to Future Brands included the following: (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Accounts receivable (invoicing by Future Brands on behalf of JBBCo.) $ 73.5 $ 68.8 $ 92.0 Investment 8.2 11.7 9.4 Accounts payable (commissions) 14.4 15.6 23.7 Accrued liabilities 24.7 29.1 4.5 Maxxium Worldwide B.V. In 1999, the spirits and wine business formed an international sales and distribution joint venture named Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (Maxxium) to distribute and sell spirits and wine in key markets outside the United States. The joint venture partners include Remy Cointreau, Highland Distillers and V&S. JBBCo. records sales at the time spirits are sold to third parties rather than at the time of shipment to Maxxium. As a result of forming this joint venture, the Company has guaranteed certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $79 million, of which $69 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002, the guarantees totaled $66 million, of which $57 million was outstanding. JBBW has executed a Shareholder Loan Facility (Loan Facility) with Maxxium. There were no amounts outstanding under the Loan Facility as of either December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002. The Loan Facility expires June 30, 2006. JBBCo.s balances related to Maxxium included the following: (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Accounts receivable $ 39.4 $ 34.6 $ 39.5 Investment 66.7 64.3 63.0 Accounts payable (expense reimbursement) 16.0 12.3 6.1 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The objective of FIN 46 is to improve financial reporting by companies with transactions involving variable interest entities. Prior to FIN 46, companies generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. FIN 46 changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk or loss from the variable interest 21 Table of Contents entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. Consolidation by a primary beneficiary of the assets, liabilities and results of activities of variable interest entities will provide more complete information about the resources, obligations, risks and opportunities of the consolidated company. FIN 46 is effective for newly created variable interest entities as of January 31, 2003 and is effective for existing variable interest entities as of October 1, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (46R) to clarify certain provisions of FIN 46 and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. Special effective dates apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied Interpretation 46 prior to issuance of 46R. Otherwise, application of 46R or FIN 46 is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. The Company is still assessing the impact, if any, 46R and FIN 46 will have on the Companys results or financial position. In November 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 150 3 (FSP 150 3), Effective Date, Disclosure, and Transition for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest under FASB Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. FSP 150 3 defers the effective date for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests indefinitely pending further FASB action. The initial adoption of SFAS 150 did not have an impact on the Companys results or financial position. The Company will evaluate the impact of any additional requirements of this standard as it is finalized. In January 2004, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 1 (SFAS 106 1), Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. FAS 106 1 permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). The Company has elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Act until the FASB issues guidance on how to account for the federal subsidy to be provided to plan sponsors under the Act. As a result, the accompanying financial statements and notes do not reflect the effects of the Act. However, upon final issuance of the accounting, the Company could be required to change previously reported information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies requires all registrants, including the Company, to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. The Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the following are the Companys critical accounting policies due to the more significant judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements. The Company regularly reviews its assumptions and estimates, which are based on historical experience. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are stated less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations, usually due to customers potential insolvency or early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns was $63.5 million and $65.8 million as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Alternatively, if we provided an allowance of 0.50% for net sales to customers for cash discounts and returns and allowances and 3% of our year end customer receivables for doubtful accounts, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns would have been approximately $55 million as of December 31, 2003 and $49 million as of December 31, 2002. The actual rates used are company specific based upon the nature of the business. Inventories Inventories are priced at the lower of cost (principally first in, first out and average, with minor amounts at last in, first out) or market. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice, bulk whiskey inventories are classified as current assets, although the majority of such inventories, due to the duration of aging processes, ordinarily will not be sold within one year. Inventory reserves are recorded for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory turns and specific identification of items, such as components or finished goods. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided, principally on a straight line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses resulting from dispositions are included in income. Betterments and renewals, which improve and extend the life of an asset, are capitalized; maintenance and repair costs are expensed. Estimated useful lives of the related assets are as follows: Buildings and improvements to leaseholds 20 to 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 12 years Long lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (SFAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, a long lived asset or asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on managements best estimate at the time of future cash flow derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated using a quoted market price, or if unavailable, using discounted expected future cash flows. The discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on the Companys weighted average cost of capital, which represents the blended after tax costs of debt and equity. Intangibles In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and under certain circumstances, and written down when impaired. In addition, SFAS 142 requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as it was deemed that these tradenames are currently anticipated to contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. The rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital, risk adjusted where appropriate. Estimated cash flows are then determined by disaggregating our business segments to a reporting level for which meaningful identifiable cash flows can be determined. When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangibles) and related goodwill, impairment losses of goodwill are charged to operations. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the sum of the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangibles) and goodwill over the discounted cash flows of the business being evaluated. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. 23 Table of Contents Indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed annually, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impact on that intangible. Management, in developing and executing its short term and long term plans, considers the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, pricing, competition, technology) and internal factors (e.g. product costs, margins, support expenses, capital investment) and their potential impact on cash flows for each business in both the near and long term, as well as their impact on any identifiable intangible asset associated with the business. Based on recent business results, consideration of significant external and internal factors, and the resulting business projections, indefinite lived intangible assets associated with that segment are reviewed to determine whether they are likely to remain indefinite lived, or whether a finite life is more appropriate. In addition, based on events in the period and future expectations, management considers whether the potential for impairment exists as required by SFAS 142. Our predominant method of approximating fair value in determining whether an impairment exists is to use cash flow projections. We measure impairment based on discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the tradename compared to the carrying value of that tradename. When separate cash flow information is not available, we use the relief from royalty approach. Fair value is represented by the present value of hypothetical royalty income over the remaining useful life. Where information is not available to determine an appropriate royalty rate, we utilize an excess earnings methodology to establish a reasonable royalty rate. Excess earnings are represented by actual and projected earnings divided by a reasonable pre tax return on net tangible assets. Additionally, independent valuation experts are used for periodic review and testing of managements assumptions relative to all significant trade valuations and lives, and for independent research on market and competitive dynamics. In conjunction with our ongoing review of the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles, in the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a non cash write down of identifiable intangibles of $12.0 million, $8.0 million after tax (five cents basic and diluted per share) to recognize the diminished values of certain trade names in conjunction with our repositioning plans in the office business. In 2001, the Company recorded a non cash write down of identifiable intangibles of $73.3 million, $67.1 million after tax (44 cents basic and 43 cents diluted per share). The write down recognized the diminished fair values of certain identifiable intangibles resulting from the restructuring of the office business and the consolidation of non core tradenames in home and hardware. The write downs by business segment were: office $64.4 million; and home and hardware $8.9 million. Warranty Reserves We offer our customers various warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold. Warranty expense is determined in accordance with the policy established at each operating company. The main consideration is historic claim experience, which is company specific based upon the nature of the product category. Warranty expense is generally recorded at the time of sale. 24 Table of Contents A reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of warranty reserves for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: (In millions) 2003 2002(1) 2001(1) Reserve balance at beginning of year $ (9.2 ) $ (8.0 ) $ (9.0 ) Provision for warranties issued (28.7 ) (23.4 ) (18.7 ) Acquisitions (0.1 ) (0.5 ) Settlements made (in cash or in kind) 25.1 22.7 19.7 Reserve balance at end of year $ (12.9 ) $ (9.2 ) $ (8.0 ) (1) We have reclassified 2002 and 2001 warranty reserve activity to conform to 2003 disclosure. Alternatively, if we provided a provision of 0.5% of net sales to customers, the warranty provision would have been $27.4 million, $24.9 million and $24.9 million as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Employee Benefit Plans We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement, post employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As required by United States generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of our modifications are generally recorded and amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the Companys plans are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries. We will continue to monitor these assumptions as market conditions warrant. In 2002, our pension and postretirement expenses were $21.9 million and $10.1 million, respectively. In 2003, our pension and postretirement expenses were $28.1 million and $11.5 million, respectively. We expect pension expense of approximately $35 million and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $15 million in 2004. A 25 basis point change (0.25%) in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension expense and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $3 million and $1 million, respectively, for 2004. A 25 basis point change in the long term rate of return used in accounting for the Companys pension plans would have a $2 million impact on pension expense. Revenue Recognition In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, we recognize revenue as products are shipped to customers, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. Criteria for recognition of revenue are persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We also provide for our estimate of potential bad debt at the time of revenue recognition. Amounts billed for shipping and handling are classified in net sales in the consolidated income statement. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are classified in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses. Customer Program Costs Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in many of our businesses. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume allowances, are accounted for as reductions to gross sales. These costs are recorded at the time of sale based on managements best estimates. Estimates are based on historical experience for each type of program or customer. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and accruals are adjusted, when circumstances, typically expected volume deviations, indicate. 25 Table of Contents Stock based Compensation We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the stock option plans. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, requires disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share amounts as if compensation expense was recognized. For the required disclosure, SFAS 148 allows the use of a fair value method to measure compensation expense. Accordingly, we have adopted the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine our compensation expense for disclosure purposes. The model requires the use of the following assumptions: an expected dividend yield; expected volatility; risk free interest rate; and expected term. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $13.40, $11.63 and $8.91, respectively, per option. Based upon the range provided for the assumptions utilized, any alternative fair values per option would not have materially differed from the fair values listed above. For example, a change in the expected term from 4.5 to 5 years, would have had a $0.77, or 6%, impact on the weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2003. Had SFAS 148 been applied, the pro forma diluted EPS impact would have been a decrease of $0.12, $0.10 and $0.10 per share, respectively, for 2003, 2002 and 2001. Derivative Financial Instruments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related amendment Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 (SFAS 138), Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Derivative gains or losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, $3.3 million in deferred losses and $0.6 million in deferred gains were reclassified to cost of sales. The Company estimates that $1.1 million of derivative loss included in OCI as of December 31, 2003 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. Foreign Currency Risk Certain forecasted transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Pound sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. Interest Rate Risk We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amounts. We record the payments or receipts on the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $200 million. The swap agreements are based on our outstanding 2.875% notes due 2006 which allow the swap agreements to be classified as a fair value hedge in accordance with SFAS 133. The agreements effectively convert the interest paid on $200 million of underlying debt securities from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on a LIBOR reference rate. As of December 31, 2002 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements. 26 Table of Contents Cost Initiatives We continuously evaluate the productivity of our supply chains and existing asset base, and actively seek to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure. Future opportunities may involve, among other things, the reorganization of operations, the relocation of manufacturing or assembly to locations generally having lower costs and the efficient sourcing of products or components from third party suppliers. Implementing any significant cost reduction and efficiency opportunities could result in charges. 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales Net sales increased $118.1 million, or 2%, to $5.7 billion. Sales benefited from the acquisition of Omega Holdings, Inc., a U.S. based manufacturer of custom and semi custom cabinetry, increased volumes with the introduction of new products and line extensions, principally in the golf business, and favorable foreign exchange of $20 million. These benefits were partly offset by lower volumes in certain existing product lines in the golf and office businesses, the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in October 2001, the absence of ABSOLUT revenues recorded on an interim basis in 2001 and five fewer selling days in 2002 for the cabinets business due to the use of the 53 week and 52 week business calendar in consecutive years. Excise taxes on spirits and wine Excise taxes on spirits and wine decreased $49.3 million, or 14%. The decrease was principally due to the absence of the ABSOLUT revenues recorded on an interim basis in 2001 and the absence of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in 2002. The Companys spirits and wine business incurred federal excise taxes in the U.S., and in addition to the U.S., had incurred excise taxes in the U.K. for the first nine months of 2001 prior to the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $85.2 million, or 6%, on higher advertising and marketing expenditures and pension expense, partially offset by cost savings achieved from the Future Brands LLC joint venture established in June 2001 and our restructuring actions and other cost containment initiatives across all of our operations, particularly in our office business. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles decreased $46.6 million, or 74%, due to the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) as of January 1, 2002. Write down of identifiable intangibles and goodwill In 2002, we did not record a write down of either identifiable intangibles or goodwill. In 2001, we did record a non cash write down identifiable intangibles of $73.3 million, $67.1 million after tax (44 cents basic and 43 cents diluted per share). The write down recognized the diminished fair values of select identifiable intangibles resulting from the restructuring of the office business and the consolidation of non core tradenames in home and hardware. The write downs by business segment were: office $64.4 million; and home and hardware $8.9 million. Restructuring charges For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $45.9 million ($29.8 million after tax). The charges principally related to planned workforce reduction costs, asset write offs and costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, primarily in the office business ($34.3 million pre tax), and the sale of certain non strategic product lines in the home and hardware ($10.9 million pre tax) and spirits and wine ($0.7 million pre tax) businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $45.4 million ($29.8 million after tax). These charges principally related to product line discontinuances, expenses associated with the exploration of strategic options and planned workforce reduction initiatives across the operations of the office business ($27.2 million pre tax), lease cancellation costs in the specialty plumbing parts business ($15.2 million pre tax) and capacity reductions in select technology platforms in the golf business ($3.0 million pre tax). 27 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense decreased $22.7 million, or 23%. This decrease primarily reflected lower average borrowings as we repaid short term debt using proceeds received from V&S and from the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business and increased operating cash flow as well as lower interest rates, partially offset by commercial paper borrowings used to finance the Omega acquisition. Other income, net Other income, net decreased $13.7 million to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 due principally to the absence of the $16.6 million gain on the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business and lower interest income on a tax receivable in 2002 as compared to 2001. The components of other income, net, for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: (In millions) 2002 2001 Reconciliation of 2002 and 2001 other income, net Amortization of deferred income $ 27.0 $ 15.8 Interest income on tax receivable 14.9 28.5 Gain on sale of U.K. based Scotch whisky business 16.6 Other miscellaneous items 1.8 (3.5 ) Total $ 43.7 $ 57.4 Income taxes Income taxes increased $119.8 million, or 127%. The reported effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were 28.3% and 19.2%, respectively. The increase was principally due to the higher operating income and lower interest expense partially offset by the tax credit of $61.7 million recorded in June 2002. The effective income tax rate comparison was impacted by the recognition, during the second quarter of 2002, of a $61.7 million tax credit resulting from new IRS regulations that reinterpret the capital loss disallowance rules. The new regulations enabled us to utilize a capital loss incurred in 1994 to offset capital gains taxed in 1996 and 1997. The other factors affecting the effective income tax rate comparison include: the reversal of a $31.0 million tax reserve for the years 1990 through 1992 in the second quarter of 2001 and the $72.9 million net tax benefit recognized as a result of the recapitalization of the office business in the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding these tax related items, the effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were 36.5% and 37.9%, respectively. This lower effective tax rate principally reflects lower goodwill amortization related to the adoption of SFAS 142. Minority interests Minority interests increased $4.9 million, or 43%, principally on the recognition of five additional months of preferred dividends payable to V&S, on their 10% interest in JBBW, in 2002 as compared to 2001. Net income Net income of $525.6 million, or $3.51 basic and $3.41 diluted per share, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with net income of $386.0 million, or $2.55 basic and $2.49 diluted per share, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in net income of $139.6 million was principally due to the higher sales, the lower cost of sales, lower intangible amortization and interest expense, partly offset by higher income taxes, increased advertising and marketing expenditures and higher pension expense. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 included the following net gains and charges: the recognition of a $61.7 million tax credit and related interest income of $14.9 million ($9.6 million after tax) and the $55.8 million ($36.2 million after tax) in restructuring and restructuring related charges. In addition, net income for the year ended December 31, 2001, included the following net gains and charges: the recognition of a $72.9 million net tax 28 Table of Contents benefit and related interest income of $28.5 million ($17.3 million after tax); the reversal of a $31.0 million tax reserve that was no longer required; the $16.6 million ($21.8 million after tax) gain on the sale of the U.K based Scotch whisky business; the $98.1 million ($63.3 million after tax) of restructuring and restructuring related charges; and the $73.3 million ($67.1 million after tax) write down of certain identifiable intangibles. Home and Hardware 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $367.7 million, or 15%, to $2.9 billion. The increase is attributable to strong underlying operating performance, the full year consolidation of Omega and the acquisitions of Therma Tru, American Lock and Capital Cabinet ($163 million from acquisitions in aggregate), successful line extensions and new product introductions ($157 million), principally in cabinets and faucets, as well as expanded customer relationships. The sales growth was tempered by the absence of the divested plumbing parts business ($53 million) and soft retail volume in our tool storage business. Operating income increased $82.8 million, or 21%, to $481.3 million on higher sales, productivity improvements, and the absence of the low return plumbing product lines sold in 2002 ($4 million), partially offset by higher operating expenses, including increased commissions on higher sales, additional support for cabinet business growth and increased amortization of in store cabinet displays. In November 2003, the home and hardware business acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc., the leading manufacturer of residential entry door systems in the United States. The acquisition price was $924.0 million, net of cash. In June 2003, the home and hardware business acquired Capital Cabinet Corporation, a U.S. based manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinets. In April 2003, the home and hardware business acquired American Lock Company, the largest U.S. based manufacturer of solid body commercial padlocks. In April 2002, the home and hardware business acquired Omega, a U.S. based manufacturer of custom and semi custom cabinetry. This acquisition broadened our cabinet product line and is providing additional selling opportunities across customers, while producing purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies. The cost of this acquisition was $538 million. In October 2003, Waterloo announced plans to close its Muskogee, OK manufacturing facility in 2004. Related to that action, we expect to record approximately $7 million ($12 million pre tax) of restructuring and restructuring related charges. Management expects that our home and hardware business will continue to benefit from strong demographic trends supporting the home repair and remodeling and new home construction markets, particularly for kitchen and bath products and residential door systems. These trends include growth in the number of U.S. households, increases in household wealth and the aging of the housing stock. Our home and hardware business may be impacted over the long term by U.S. economic conditions, including mortgage interest rates, and their potential impact on the U.S. housing and remodeling markets. In addition, we continue to face pricing pressure associated with consolidation of the industry customer base. Such consolidation may also present opportunities for our business. 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales improved $463.4 million, or 22%, to $2.5 billion as a result of the acquisition of Omega and strong underlying sales growth reflecting share gains and a robust building and remodeling market. Underlying sales growth also benefited from new product introductions and line extensions and higher volumes in certain existing product lines, primarily cabinets and Moen faucets. Partially offsetting these benefits were increased rebates and five fewer selling days in 2002 for the cabinets business, due to the use of the 53 week and 52 week business calendar in consecutive years, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange of $2 million. 29 Table of Contents Operating income increased $147.8 million, or 59%, to $398.5 million. The higher operating income resulted from the acquisition of Omega Holdings, Inc., higher underlying sales across all of our home and hardware businesses, positive operating leverage, ongoing cost and productivity gains, a reduction in intangible amortization due to the adoption of SFAS 142, lower restructuring and restructuring related charges, and absence of goodwill write downs. Spirits and Wine 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $58.5 million, or 6%, to $1.1 billion on the benefit of foreign exchange ($35 million), growth in underlying sales ($17 million), primarily Jim Beam ready to drink products in Australia, higher sales of DeKuyper cordials and super premium spirits in the U.S., and higher pricing for Jim Beam bourbon. These benefits were partly offset by decreased volumes for some non premium products in the U.S. Operating income increased $26.5 million, or 10%, to $302.8 million benefiting from favorable foreign exchange ($22 million) and higher revenues, partly offset by increased selling and marketing administration costs ($12 million). In July 2003, the spirits and wine business acquired Wild Horse Winery, a California based producer of premium and ultra premium wines. In December 2003, the spirits and wine business extended the rights to manufacture and distribute Gilbeys gin and vodka for an additional 20 years, and acquired trademark rights to Kamchatka vodka in California. On May 31, 2001, the Companys spirits and wine business completed transactions with V&S creating a joint venture named Future Brands to distribute, over an initial ten year period, both companies spirits brands in the United States. The Companys spirits and wine business has accounted for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting. Future Brands is not consolidated into our spirits and wine business as V&S has substantive participating rights which preclude consolidation. V&S paid $270 million to gain access to our spirits and wine businesss U.S. distribution network and to acquire a 49% interest in Future Brands, and paid $375 million to purchase a 10% equity interest in JBBW. The Company amortizes the $270 million gain on the sale of 49% of Future Brands as deferred income on a straight line basis over the initial ten year term of the agreement. In addition to the investment in Future Brands, V&S acquired a 25% interest in Maxxium. As a result of this investment by V&S, our spirits and wine business received an $8.2 million dividend from Maxxium, thereby reducing its investment in the joint venture. Management expects that our spirits and wine business will continue to benefit from growth in the premium and super premium spirits market on which it has focused its product development and marketing activities. Factors that could adversely affect results include the possibility of excise tax increases, increased regulation, class actions and or other litigation, pricing activity on key brands, and continued soft demand in the restaurant and bar channel. In addition, the spirits and wine industry could be impacted by the continued trend towards consolidation of the supplier, distributor and retailer tiers. 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales decreased $335.5 million, or 25%, to $1.0 billion principally due to the divestiture of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in October 2001, and sales of ABSOLUT vodka no longer recorded on an interim basis in 2002. These factors were partially offset by higher average selling prices for Jim Beam bourbon in the U.S. and DeKuyper products, increased sales of Beam ready to drink products in Australia and sales of premium and super premium products in the U.S., and favorable foreign exchange of $9 million. With the establishment of the U.S. subsidiary of V&S as the exclusive importer of V&S products, revenues and expenses under the interim arrangement were no longer recorded by our spirits and wine business beginning February 1, 2002. 30 Table of Contents Operating income decreased $9.4 million, or 3%, to $276.3 million, as a result of the absence of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business in 2002. In addition, other factors impacting this decrease were increased brand advertising and support costs, specifically for our premium and super premium brands in the U.S. and After Shock liqueur in the U.K., lower sales of bulk wine, lower cooperage income from the sale of used oak barrels, and lower sales of After Shock in the U.K. These factors were partly offset by lower distribution costs in the United States as a result of the Future Brands joint venture established in June 2001 and the higher comparable sales, favorable foreign exchange ($6 million) and lower intangible amortization as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142. Golf 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $114.1 million, or 11%, to $1.1 billion. The increase was led by significant share gains across all product categories benefiting from line extensions and the introduction of successful new golf club and golf ball products ($78 million), as well as favorable foreign exchange ($30 million) and favorable product mix. Our golf business achieved sales growth and share gains despite a 3% reduction in rounds of play in the U.S. Operating income increased $9.3 million, or 7%, to $139.1 million benefiting from higher sales and favorable foreign exchange ($4 million). The increase was partially offset by higher marketing costs, as well as restructuring related charges ($6 million). In April 2003, our golf business announced plans to consolidate its three golf ball manufacturing facilities into its two newest production facilities. We believe this consolidation will create manufacturing efficiencies while preserving capacity to meet expected future demand. For this consolidation, we recorded restructuring and restructuring related charges of $3.5 million ($5.8 million pre tax). In 2004, we expect to record additional restructuring and restructuring related charges of approximately $4 million ($7 million pre tax) to complete restructuring activities. The U.S. golf industry has been negatively impacted over the past four years by a decrease in rounds of play. Management believes this decrease is due to a combination of weak economic conditions, poor weather conditions and a decrease in destination travel and corporate spending. The lower rounds of play and the entrance of significant competitors into the category have led to increased competition. Despite these market conditions, the Companys U.S. market share in golf balls, clubs, shoes, gloves and accessories has increased. The future success of the Companys golf business will depend upon continued strong innovation and marketing across its product categories. The United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A) establish standards for golf equipment used in the United States and outside the United States, respectively. Each of the USGA and the R&A has enacted new rules restricting golf club head size and golf club shaft length and has proposed new rules addressing the overall distance standard for golf balls. These newly enacted and proposed rules, when combined with other existing rules, could reduce the golf products industrys ability to innovate and deploy new technologies, potentially impacting our golf business. 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales increased $61.1 million, or 6%, to $1.0 billion due to successful new products and line extensions, particularly in golf clubs, partly offset by lower volumes in certain existing product lines and favorable foreign exchange of $0.6 million. 31 Table of Contents Operating income increased $5.7 million, or 5%, to $129.8 million on the higher sales and absence of restructuring and restructuring related charges in 2002, partly offset by increased marketing spending to support new product initiatives and a more challenging pricing environment. Office 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales of $1.1 billion were flat with last year. Sales benefited from favorable foreign exchange ($56 million) and new products, offset by lower sales in the U.S. and the U.K. due to soft industry conditions, including higher U.S. white collar unemployment, and the continued share gain of private label products. Operating income increased $30.2 million, or 110%, to $57.6 million benefiting from the businesss ongoing repositioning program, including successful cost reductions, as well as favorable foreign exchange ($7 million). Since 2001, we have been repositioning and restructuring the office business to improve both financial results and the long term value of the business. Under this plan, our office business has significantly realigned and streamlined its worldwide operations, intensified its focus on growing profitable core product categories, and reduced overhead expenses and excess capacity. Related to the final phase of our office repositioning, in 2003 we recorded total after tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of $20.9 million ($27.9 million pre tax). We expect to record additional after tax charges of approximately $15 million ($20 to $25 million pre tax) to complete this final phase over the first six months of 2004. Once completed, this restructuring program will have reduced the businesss manufacturing and distribution square footage by approximately forty percent, providing significant cost savings and a more responsive supply chain. These actions, combined with major working capital improvements, have improved the businesss return on capital. The office products industry is increasingly concentrated in a small number of major customers, principally office products superstores, large retailers, wholesalers and contract stationers. Continued customer consolidation and share growth of private label products are increasing pricing pressures, which may adversely affect margins for our office group and its competitors. 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales decreased $70.9 million, or 6%, to $1.1 billion, primarily due to lower volumes in the United States and Europe. Approximately half of the sales decrease was due to the full year effect of discontinued product lines resulting from initiatives to refocus the business around its core product categories. The balance of the sales decrease was caused primarily by weakness in the U.S. and European economies, a sales decrease in our paper based time management business and price reductions related to a mix shift to private label products. In addition, a decrease in the number of office workers negatively impacted the demand for the businesss products. The introduction of new products, improved product mix, lower customer rebates and favorable foreign exchange of $12 million partly offset the decrease in net sales. Operating income improved $117.7 million, or 130%, to $27.4 million reflecting the substantial cost savings achieved by the businesss restructuring actions and its repositioning to focus on its most profitable product categories, as well as absence of 2001s goodwill write down, lower restructuring and restructuring related charges, and lower intangible amortization due to the adoption of SFAS 142 and write down of intangibles in 2001. 32 Table of Contents Quarterly Financial Data Fortune Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries Unaudited (In millions, except per share amounts) 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 2003 Net sales $ 1,392.1 $ 1,582.1 $ 1,583.8 $ 1,656.5 Gross profit 550.9 654.3 653.5 680.5 Operating income 172.6 240.4 238.9 265.6 Net income 99.5 176.7 146.1 156.9 Earnings per common share Basic Net income $ .68 $ 1.22 1.01 $ 1.07 Diluted Net income $ .66 $ 1.18 $ .98 $ 1.04 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 2002 Net sales $ 1,270.4 $ 1,512.6 $ 1,463.1 $ 1,431.6 Gross profit 497.6 613.3 587.7 593.4 Operating income 149.0 216.6 197.5 223.5 Net income 84.0 196.9 113.3 131.4 Earnings per common share Basic Net income $ .57 $ 1.31 $ .75 $ .88 Diluted Net income $ .55 $ 1.27 $ .73 $ .86 Financial Condition Cash Flow Data Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Companys cash generation continued to be strong in 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was $790.7 million compared with $787.0 million in 2002. The principal reasons for the change were higher net income, partially offset by lower working capital in 2003. Free Cash Flow For the year ended December 31, 2003, free cash flow of $441.9 million represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, net, and dividends to stockholders. Free cash flow is targeted to be in the range of $400 million in 2004. Free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were: For years ended December 31, (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 790.7 $ 787.0 $ 638.7 Less: Net capital expenditures 181.9 186.4 204.0 Dividends paid 166.9 153.4 148.0 Free cash flow(1) $ 441.9 $ 447.2 $ 286.7 (1) Free cash flow is not a measure derived under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with helpful supplemental information about the Companys ability to fund internal growth, make acquisitions, repay debt and repurchase common stock. This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. 33 Table of Contents Net Cash Used by Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1,229.6 million, compared to net cash used of $600.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Capital Expenditures We focus our capital spending on growth initiatives and becoming the lowest cost producers of the highest quality products. Capital expenditures in 2003 ($194 million) were essentially the same as 2002. We currently estimate 2004 capital expenditures will be in the range of $225 to $250 million. We expect to generate these funds internally. Acquisitions, Dispositions and Joint Ventures In the fourth quarter of 2003, our home and hardware business acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc. for net cash of $924.0 million. In addition, our subsidiaries also acquired Wild Horse Winery, Capital Cabinet Corporation, American Lock Company and renewed licenses for Gilbeys gin and vodka and acquired trademark rights to the Kamchatka vodka brand in California. The aggregate cost of these acquisitions was $123.7 million. In 2002, our home and hardware business acquired Omega Holdings, Inc. for $433.0 million in cash and $100.0 million in subsequently retired debt. In addition, we received proceeds on the sale of a non strategic product line in our spirits and wine business and for the sale of the specialty plumbing parts business in our home and hardware segment, aggregating $18.6 million. In 2001, our spirits and wine business entered into the Future Brands joint venture and received proceeds totaling $270 million from V&S for the assets contributed; and received proceeds totaling $280 million from the sale of the U.K. based Scotch whisky business. In addition, the spirits and wine business acquired long term distribution rights for its super premium tequila brands in 2001 for $6.5 million. Net Cash Provided and Used by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $515.4 million, as compared to net cash used of $219.1 million in 2002. The increase primarily related to short term and long term debt issuance to finance the acquisition of Therma Tru ($365.2 million and $599.0 million, respectively) partly offset by maturing long term debt of $132.6 million, share repurchases of $207.2 million (4.1 million shares), and higher dividend payments. In November 2003, we acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc. for net cash of $924.0 million. Initial financing of the acquisition was executed with issuance of commercial paper and subsequently partially paid down with two long term debt issues totaling $600 million. This included $300 million of three year notes and $300 million of ten year notes. Dividends In 2003, we paid common dividends of $1.14 per share. Dividends paid to common stockholders in 2003 increased to $166.9 million from $153.4 million in 2002 as the increase in our dividend rate offset the lower shares outstanding. With the September 2, 2003 dividend payment, we increased the common stock quarterly dividend by 11% to $.30 per share, or an indicated annual rate of $1.20 per share. Financial Position At December 31, 2003, total debt increased $837.6 million to $2.0 billion. Short term debt increased $436.7 million and long term increased $400.9 million. Our total debt to total capital ratio increased to 39.0% at December 31, 2003 from 29.5% at December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily a result of debt issued to finance the Therma Tru acquisition. At December 31, 2003, $400 million of debt securities were available for public sale under our shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 34 Table of Contents At December 31, 2003, we maintained two credit facilities, which we entered into in 2001 and 2003. Such agreements include a $750 million 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement, which expires in 2006, and a $250 million 364 Day Revolving Credit Agreement, which expires in 2004 and includes the option to extend payment for one year at our discretion for an incremental fee of .25% of the outstanding amount. These facilities are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and to support our short term borrowings in the commercial paper market. We believe that our internally generated funds, together with access to global credit markets, are adequate to meet our capital needs. Working capital (current assets net of current liabilities) decreased $240.3 million to $148.1 million at December 31, 2003. The principal reasons for the reduction were increased short term debt used to finance the acquisition of Therma Tru Holdings, Inc., partly offset by the impact of foreign exchange, higher accounts receivable due to higher fourth quarter sales, and increased inventories of bulk whiskey and new golf products. We believe that our 2003 working capital level is adequate to support continued growth. Foreign Exchange We have investments in various foreign countries, principally the United Kingdom, as well as Australia and Canada. Therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect our balance sheet and cash flow statements when translated into U.S. dollars. Interest Rates We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount. We record the payments or receipts on the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $200 million. The swap agreements are based on the outstanding 2.875% notes due 2006 which allow the agreements to be classified as a fair value hedge in accordance with SFAS 133. The agreements effectively convert the interest paid on $200 million of underlying debt securities from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on a LIBOR reference rate. At December 31, 2002, we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our $1,443.1 million and $974.6 million total long term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $1,564.8 million and $1,094.3 million, respectively. The fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. Minority Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries decreased $29.4 million principally due to the return of capital by JBBW to its stockholders, V&S Vin & Sprit AB and the Company. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity at year end 2003 increased $406.3 million principally due to higher net income, partly offset by dividends and share repurchases. We purchased, through open market purchases, 4.1 million and 5.7 million shares of common stock during 2003 and 2002, respectively. 35 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table and discussion represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2003. (In millions) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2003 Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Short term borrowings $ 530.4 $ 530.4 $ $ $ Long term debt 1,442.0 200.1 300.9 200.0 741.0 Capital lease obligations 1.1 0.4 0.6 0.1 Operating leases 242.7 54.6 81.2 47.1 59.8 Interest payments on long term debt 945.5 82.9 137.3 113.8 611.5 Purchase obligations(1) 306.7 183.1 72.9 28.2 22.5 Minimum pension obligations(2) 5.1 5.1 (1) Purchase obligations include contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; advertising, selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures. (2) The minimum pension funding requirements beyond 2004 are immaterial. In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2003. These include the guarantee of certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $79 million, of which $16 million expires in less than one year with the remaining $63 million due in one to three years; a Shareholder Loan Facility executed by JBBW and Maxxium amounting to $19 million, for which no amounts were outstanding and which expires in one to three years; Standby Letters of Credit of $40.5 million of which $37.5 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $3.0 million due in one to three years; and Surety Bonds of $21.6 million of which $21.4 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $0.2 million due in one to three years. In addition, V&S holds an option which may require us to repurchase JBBW preferred stock, which V&S purchased for $344.5 million net of returns of capital, at fair value in whole or in part any time after May 31, 2004 or upon a change in control of JBBW, JBBCo., or certain other events. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. In addition to the obligations described above, JBBCo. in the event of the default of Future Brands, is required to satisfy certain of Future Brands financial obligations. These obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. The Company does not have any other material off balance sheet obligations. Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The counterparties are major financial institutions. Interest Rate Risk The disclosure about interest rate risk required to be provided under this item is set forth under Item 7 MD&A Financial Condition Interest Rates and is incorporated herein by reference. 36 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Contracts We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions. We periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value at risk (VAR) computation to estimate the potential economic loss that we could incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The VAR estimations are intended to measure the maximum amount of our loss from adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates, given a specified confidence level, over a given period of time. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques. The estimated fair value loss shown in the table below does not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. Also, the use of the VAR model should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The following table summarizes our estimated loss under the VAR model as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (In millions) Estimated Amount of Loss Period Confidence Level 2003 foreign exchange $ 1.4 1 day 95 % 2002 foreign exchange $ 0.4 1 day 95 % The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of all outstanding contracts and the contract amounts were essentially the same. Commodities We are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. We use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility. The exposures under these contracts are not considered material to our financial statements. 37 Table of Contents
