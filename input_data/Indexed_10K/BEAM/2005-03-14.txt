(b) Financial information about industry segments. See Note 18, Information on Business Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. (c) Narrative description of business. The following is a description of the business of the subsidiaries of the Company in the industry segments of Home and Hardware, Spirits and Wine, Golf and Office. For financial information about these industry segments, see Note 18, Information on Business Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. Home and Hardware Fortune Brands Home Hardware, Inc. (Home and Hardware) is a holding company for subsidiaries in the Home and Hardware business. Subsidiaries include MasterBrand Cabinets, Inc. (MasterBrand Cabinets), Moen Incorporated (Moen), Therma Tru Corp. (Therma Tru), Master Lock Company (Master Lock) and Waterloo Industries, Inc. (Waterloo). The home and hardware industry is highly competitive. Home and Hardwares operating companies compete on the basis of product quality, price, service and responsiveness to distributor and retailer needs and end user consumer preferences. Factors that affect the Home and Hardware business results of operations include levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, principally in the U.S. Approximately 10% of Home and Hardwares sales are to international markets. MasterBrand Cabinets is engaged in manufacturing custom, semi custom, stock and ready to assemble kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities. MasterBrand Cabinets sells under brand names including Aristokraft, Decora, Schrock, Diamond, Kemper, Omega, Kitchen Craft and HomeCrest. MasterBrand Cabinets sells directly to kitchen and bath specialty dealers, home centers, wholesalers and large builders. In June 2003, MasterBrand Cabinets acquired Capital Cabinet Corporation. In April 2002, MasterBrand Cabinets acquired Omega Holdings, Inc., a manufacturer of custom and semi custom cabinetry. MasterBrand Cabinets competitors include Masco, American Woodmark Corporation and Armstrong World Industries. MasterBrand Cabinets is the second largest cabinet manufacturer in North America. Moen manufactures and or sells faucets, bath furnishings, accessories, parts and kitchen sinks in North America and East Asia. Sales are made through Moens own sales force and independent manufacturers representatives primarily to wholesalers, mass merchandisers and home centers and also to industrial 5 distributors and original equipment manufacturers. Products are sold principally in the U.S. and Canada and also in East Asia, Mexico and Latin America. Moens chief competitors include Masco, Black Decker, Kohler, American Standard and imported private label brands. Moen is the #1 faucet brand in North America. In November 2003, the Home and Hardware business acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc., a leading manufacturer of residential entry door systems in the United States. This acquisition fits our strategic focus on leading brands, shares beneficial demographics and market fundamentals with our other Home and Hardware brands, and creates valuable synergies within our Home and Hardware business. The purchase was financed through the issuance of commercial paper and subsequently partially refinanced through the issuance of long term debt securities. See Note 6, Long Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date. Therma Tru designs and manufactures fiberglass and steel residential entry door and patio door systems, primarily for sale in the United States, Canada and Western Europe. Therma Trus principal customers are building products distributors that sell door systems, windows, moldings and other millwork building products to the residential new construction market and home centers, as well as to the remodeling and renovation markets. Therma Trus competitors include Masonite, Jeld Wen and Plastpro. In June 2004, Therma Tru acquired Sentinel Doors Ltd., a leading U.K. manufacturer and installer of complete composite entry door systems. Therma Tru is the #1 residential entry door brand in the U.S. Master Lock manufactures and sells key controlled and combination padlocks, bicycle and cable locks, built in locker locks, automotive, trailer and towing locks and other specialty security devices. Sales of products designed for consumer use are made to wholesale distributors, home centers and hardware and other retail outlets. Sales of lock systems are made to industrial and institutional users, original equipment manufacturers and retail outlets. Master Lock competes with Abus, Kryptonite, Hampton and various imports in the padlock segment. In April 2003, Master Lock acquired American Lock Company, a U.S. based manufacturer of solid body commercial padlocks. In June 2004, Master Lock acquired the assets of Dudley Inc., a leading brand of school locker locks in Canada. Master Lock is the #1 padlock worldwide. Waterloo manufactures tool storage products, principally high quality steel toolboxes, tool chests, workbenches and related products. Waterloo sells to Sears for resale under the Craftsman brand owned by Sears, to Lowes under the Kobalt brand name, and under the Waterloo brand name to specialty industrial and automotive dealers, mass merchandisers, home centers and hardware stores. Waterloo competes with Snap On, Kennedy, Stanley, Stack On and others in the metal storage segment, and with Contico, Zag, Rubbermaid and others in the plastic hand box category. Waterloo is the #1 tool storage manufacturer worldwide. In November 2002, the Home and Hardware business sold the non strategic plumbing parts business. Raw materials used for the manufacture of products offered by Home and Hardwares operating companies are primarily red oak, maple and pine lumber, particleboard, rolled steel, brass, zinc, copper, nickel, and various plastic resins. These materials are available from a number of sources. In 2004, the Home and Hardware business experienced significant increases in the cost of commodities, particularly steel and particleboard (which were partially offset by price increases). Spirits and Wine Jim Beam Brands Worldwide, Inc. (JBBW) is a holding company for subsidiaries in the distilled spirits and wine business. Principal subsidiaries include Jim Beam Brands Co. (JBBCo.), Future Brands LLC, a majority owned subsidiary (Future Brands), Jim Beam Brands Australia Pty. Limited and Peak Wines International, Inc. 6 In July 2003, the Spirits and Wine business acquired Wild Horse Winery, a California based producer of premium and ultra premium wines. In December 2003, the Spirits and Wine business extended the rights to manufacture and distribute Gilbeys gin and vodka for an additional 20 years, and also acquired the trademark and distribution rights to the Kamchatka vodka brand in California (the Spirits and Wine business already owned all other U.S. rights to Kamchatka). On October 16, 2001, the Spirits and Wine business sold the U.K. based Scotch whisky business. The sale of the business consisted of the Invergordon private label and bulk Scotch operations and several regional brands in the U.K. The Company recorded an after tax gain of $21.8 million related to the sale. On May 31, 2001, the Spirits and Wine business completed transactions with VS Vin Sprit AB (VS), maker of ABSOLUT vodka, creating the Future Brands LLC joint venture to distribute both companies spirits brands in the United States. VS paid $270 million to gain access to JBBCo.s U.S. distribution network and to acquire a 49% interest in Future Brands, and paid $375 million to purchase a 10% equity interest in JBBW in the form of convertible preferred stock. VS also acquired a three year option to increase its equity stake in JBBW by up to an additional 9.9%, which expired unexercised. VS may require the Company to purchase the JBBW preferred stock in whole or in part at any time after May 31, 2004 or upon a change in control of JBBW, JBBCo., or certain other events. In August 1999, JBBW formed the Maxxium international sales and distribution joint venture with Remy Cointreau S.A. and Highland Distillers Group Limited to distribute and sell premium wines and spirits in key markets outside the United States. Concurrent with the formation of Future Brands in May 2001, VS acquired a 25% interest in Maxxium. Principal markets for the products of JBBWs subsidiaries are the U.S., Australia and the U.K. Approximately 25% of our Spirits and Wine business sales are to international markets. JBBWs leading brands are owned by its subsidiaries, except that DeKuyper cordials are produced and sold in the U.S. under a perpetual license, and Gilbeys gin and Gilbeys vodka are produced and sold in the U.S. under a license expiring September 30, 2027. JBBCo., whose operations are located in the U.S., currently produces or imports, and markets a broad line of distilled spirits, including bourbon and other whiskeys, cordials, gin, vodka and rum. JBBCo. and its predecessors have been distillers of bourbon whiskey since 1795. JBBCo.s leading brand names are Jim Beam bourbon whiskey, Knob Creek, Bookers, Bakers and Basil Haydens small batch bourbons, DeKuyper cordials, The Dalmore single malt scotch whisky, El Tesoro tequila, Windsor Canadian supreme whisky, Kessler American blended whiskey, Kamora coffee liqueur, Ronrico rum, Vox vodka, Lord Calvert Canadian whisky and Gilbeys gin. Geyser Peak, Canyon Road and Wild Horse wines are produced and sold by Peak Wines International, Inc. Products of JBBWs subsidiaries are sold through various distributors. Products are sold through government controlled liquor authorities in the 18 control states (and one county) in the U.S. that have established government control over certain aspects of the purchase and distribution of alcoholic beverages. In October 2003, JBBW signed a development and distribution agreement with Starbucks Corporation to develop, manufacture and market a new product, Starbucks Coffee Liqueur, in the U.S. The product launched nationwide in the first quarter of 2005. The distilled spirits business is highly competitive, with many brands sold in the consumer market. JBBW is the largest U.S. based producer and marketer of distilled spirits and is among the major competitors worldwide. JBBWs subsidiaries compete on the basis of product quality, price, service and innovation in response to 7 consumer preferences. Major competitors include Diageo, Allied Domecq, Pernod Ricard, Brown Forman, Bacardi and Constellation Brands. JBBW has the #1 bourbon and #1 small batch bourbon worldwide. DeKuyper is the #1 cordial in the U.S. Over the past several years, there has been a trend toward consolidation of suppliers, distributors and retailers in the highly competitive global spirits and wine business. Continued consolidation may present pricing and service challenges for our Spirits and Wine business and our competitors. It may also present opportunities, particularly for the most efficient and innovative companies. The peak season for the Spirits and Wine business is the fourth quarter due to seasonal holiday buying. Because whiskeys are aged for various periods, generally from three to nine years, subsidiaries of JBBW maintain, in accordance with industry practice, substantial inventories of aging bulk whiskey in warehouse facilities. Whiskey production is generally scheduled to meet demand years into the future, and production schedules are adjusted from time to time to bring inventories into balance with estimated future demand. In addition, JBBW may, from time to time, seek to purchase bulk whiskey if necessary to meet estimated future demand. The principal raw materials for the production, storage and aging of distilled products, especially whiskeys, are primarily corn, other grains, and new oak barrels. These materials are readily available from a number of sources except that new oak barrels are available from only a limited number of major sources, one of which is owned by a competitor. JBBCo. has a long term supply agreement for new oak barrels. The principal raw materials used in the production of wines are grapes, barrels and packaging materials. Grapes are primarily purchased from independent growers under long term supply contracts and, from time to time, are affected by weather and other forces that may impact production and quality. The production, storage, transportation, distribution and sale of the products of JBBWs subsidiaries are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Various local jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the sale of distilled spirits and wine in whole or in part. In the U.S., U.K. and many other countries, distilled spirits and wine are subject to federal excise taxes and or customs duties as well as state, local and other taxes. Beverage alcohol sales are sensitive to higher excise tax rates. Although no federal excise tax increase is presently pending in the U.S., our largest market, many states are considering possible excise tax increases and the possibility of future increases cannot be ruled out. The effect of any future excise tax increases in any jurisdiction cannot be determined, but it is possible that any future excise tax increases would have an adverse effect on unit sales and increase existing competitive pressures. Golf Acushnet Company (Acushnet), together with its subsidiaries, is a leading manufacturer and distributor of golf balls, golf clubs, golf shoes and golf gloves. Other products include golf bags, golf outerwear and accessories. Acushnets leading brands are Titleist and Pinnacle golf balls; Titleist and Cobra golf clubs; Scotty Cameron by Titleist putters; FootJoy golf shoes; FootJoy and Titleist golf gloves; and FootJoy outerwear. Acushnet products are sold primarily to on course golf pro shops and selected off course golf specialty and sporting goods stores throughout the United States. Sales are madeinthe U.K., Canada, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, France, Sweden, The Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Japan through subsidiaries and outside these areas through distributors or agents. Approximately 30% of Acushnets sales are to international markets. 8 Acushnet and its subsidiaries compete on the basis of product quality, product innovation, price, service and responsiveness to consumer preferences. Acushnet has leading market positions in golf balls (Titleist), as well as golf shoes and golf gloves (FootJoy). Acushnet also has a leading market position in golf clubs in the U.S. (Titleist Cobra). In golf balls, Acushnets main competitors are Top Flite, Nike, Bridgestone, Callaway and Maxfli. In golf clubs, Callaway, TaylorMade, Ping, Cleveland and Nike are the main competitors. In golf shoes, Nike and Adidas are the main competitors. In golf gloves, Nike, Callaway and Etonic are the main competitors. Acushnets business is seasonal and approximately 60% of its sales occur in the first half of the year and less than 20% in the fourth quarter. The principal raw materials used in manufacturing are natural and synthetic rubbers, steel, titanium, and natural and synthetic leathers. Acushnets advertising and promotional campaigns rely in part on a large number of touring professionals and club professionals using and endorsing its products. The market for the endorsement and promotional services of touring professionals has been and will continue to be increasingly competitive. There is currently a substantial market in knock off and counterfeit golf clubs, which imitate or copy the protected features of original equipment manufacturers golf club products. Acushnet has an active program of enforcing intellectual property rights against those who make or sell these products. The U.S. golf industry is highly competitive. Despite favorable demographics of an aging population (rounds of play increasing with age), rounds of play in the U.S. have decreased over the past four years and were essentially flat in 2004 as a result of a combination of decreased golf related travel, economic conditions, lower corporate spending and weather conditions. While competitors with high inventories in the marketplace, especially for clubs, resorted to significant price discounting, Acushnets retail inventories were not excessive and we maintained relatively strong pricing for current products. The future success of the Golf business will depend upon continued innovation and marketing across product categories. The United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (RA) establish standards for golf equipment used in the United States and outside the United States, respectively. Each of the USGA and the RA has enacted new rules restricting golf club head size and golf club shaft length, and changing the overall distance standard for golf balls. These new rules, when combined with other existing rules, could reduce the golf products industrys ability to innovate and deploy new technologies, potentially impacting our Golf business. Any new rules may provide increased opportunities to the most innovative golf equipment manufacturers. Office ACCO World Corporation (ACCO) is a holding company for subsidiaries engaged in designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide variety of traditional and computer related office products, supplies, personal computer accessory products, paper based time management products, presentation aids and label products. Approximately 50% of our office business sales are to international markets. Products are manufactured by subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees of ACCO, or manufactured to these subsidiaries specifications by third party suppliers, principally in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Asia. ACCO Brands, Inc. (ACCO Brands), ACCOs primary U.S. operating company, manufactures and sells binders, fasteners, paper clips, punches, staples, stapling equipment and storage products, computer supplies and accessories, labels and presentation products. ACCO Canada Inc., a subsidiary of ACCO, manufactures binders and distributes in Canada a range of office products similar to that distributed by ACCO Brands in the U.S. ACCO Mexicana S.A. de C.V. manufactures binders and fasteners, and distributes in Mexico a range of 9 office products similar to that distributed by ACCO Brands in the U.S. Principal office products brands include Swingline stapling and punch products, Wilson Jones binders and labels, Kensington computer accessories and supplies, Apollo and Boone presentation products and ACCO fastener products. Products are sold throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico by in house sales forces and independent representatives to office and computer products wholesalers, retailers/superstores, dealers, mail order companies and mass merchandisers. Operating units of ACCO Europe PLC (ACCO Europe), another subsidiary of ACCO, manufacture and distribute a wide range of office supplies and machines, storage and retrieval filing systems and presentation products. ACCO Europes products are sold primarily in the U.K., Ireland, Western Europe and Australia through internal sales forces and through distributors. Principal brands sold by ACCO Europes subsidiaries include Rexel filing, stapling, binding, and laminating products, Twinlock filing products, Kensington computer accessories, Nobo presentation products and, in Australia, Marbig products. Day Timers, Inc. (Day Timers), a subsidiary of ACCO, manufactures and distributes personal organizers and planners in the U.S. Products are sold in the U.S. and Canada by Day Timers and in Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. by subsidiaries of Day Timers through direct mail advertising, catalogs to consumers and businesses, and electronic commerce. In addition, products are sold through ACCO Brands and ACCO Canada to retailers and mass merchandisers. Management believes that manufacturing within the office products industry remains highly fragmented. Due to local market preferences for product design and paper sizes, many office product manufacturers supply on a country specific basis only. Many manufacturers supply a relatively narrow range of products. ACCOs key competitors include Avery Dennison, Esselte, Newell Rubbermaid, Fellowes, Cardinal and GBC. Primary competitors for personal organizers in the North American market are Franklin Quest and Mead (including Day Runner). In computer accessories, ACCO competes against Fellowes, Logitech, Microsoft, Targus, Belkin and others. ACCO and Kensington are also facing increasing competition from private label and customers direct sourcing initiatives at retail. ACCOs operating companies compete on the basis of consumer knowledge, product quality, innovation, price, service and responsiveness to consumer demand preferences. ACCOs subsidiaries purchase raw materials, components and products from a variety of sources on competitively available terms that fluctuate based on market conditions. Principal raw materials are paper, steel, plastics, melamine, electronic components and cork. Other Matters Employees As of December 31, 2004, the Company and its subsidiaries had the following number of employees: Home and Hardware 21,171 Spirits and Wine 1,284 Golf 4,910 Office 4,375 Corporate Office 111 Total 31,851 Environmental Matters The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling, disposal and clean up of waste materials and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential 10 impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Companys subsidiaries may undertake in the future. Management of the Company does not expect compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, to have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Tobacco Overview On December 22, 1994, the Company sold The American Tobacco Company (ATCO) to Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation (BW), at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of B.A.T Industries p.l.c. In connection with the sale, BW and ATCO, which subsequently merged into BW, agreed, under an Indemnification 12 Agreement, to indemnify the Company against claims including legal expenses arising from smoking and health and fire safe cigarette matters relating to the tobacco business of ATCO. On July 30, 2004, BW and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc. announced that they had completed the combination of their respective U.S. tobacco businesses, previously conducted by BW (and ATCO) and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., by forming a new combined company known as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. As a result of the combination and in accordance with the Indemnification Agreement, the new R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has assumed the indemnification obligations under the Indemnification Agreement relating to the U.S. business previously conducted by BW (and ATCO). BW has not been released from any of its obligations under the Indemnification Agreement. We refer to BW and the new R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company as the Indemnitor under the Indemnification Agreement. The Indemnitor has complied with the terms of the indemnification agreement since 1994 and the Company is not aware of any inability on the part of the Indemnitor to satisfy its indemnitor obligations. Numerous legal actions, proceedings and claims are pending in various jurisdictions against leading tobacco manufacturers, including BW both individually and as successor by merger to ATCO, based upon allegations that cancer and other ailments have resulted from tobacco use. The Company has been named as a defendant in some of these cases. These claims have generally fallen within three categories: (i) smoking and health cases alleging personal injury brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs, (ii) smoking and health cases alleging personal injury and other damages and purporting to be brought on behalf of classes of individual plaintiffs, and (iii) health care cost recovery cases, including class actions, brought by foreign governments, unions, health trusts, taxpayers and others seeking reimbursement for health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking. Damages claimed in some of the cases range into the billions of dollars. Individual Cases As of February 10, 2005, there were approximately 19 smoking and health cases pending on behalf of individual plaintiffs in which the Company has been named as one of the defendants, compared with approximately 26 such cases as of February 17, 2004. See List of Pending Cases below. Class Actions As of February 10, 2005, there were approximately five purported smoking and health class actions pending in which the Company has been named as one of the defendants compared with approximately six such cases as of February 17, 2004. See List of Pending Cases below. Health Care Cost Recovery Actions As of February 10, 2005, there was one health care recovery action pending in which the Company has been named as one of the defendants, compared with one such case as of February 17, 2004. See List of Pending Cases below. Certain Developments Affecting the Indemnitor On July 14, 2000, in Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, et. al., a Florida state case brought against BW (individually and as successor to ATCO) and other U.S. tobacco manufacturers on behalf of a class of Florida residents allegedly injured as a result of their alleged addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, a jury awarded a total of $144.87 billion in punitive damages against the defendants, including $17.59 billion against BW. On November 6, 2000, Florida Circuit Judge Robert Kaye upheld this jury award, and held that the class of plaintiffs eligible to recover damages should be extended to smokers with illnesses diagnosed more than four years 13 before the lawsuit was filed in 1994. On May 21, 2003, a Florida appellate court reversed the jurys verdict and damages award and decertified the class. The Company is not a party to the Engle litigation. In September 1999, the United States government filed a recoupment lawsuit in Federal Court in Washington, D.C. against the leading tobacco manufacturers (including BW individually and as a successor to ATCO) seeking recovery of costs paid by the Federal government for claimed smoking related illness. In this action, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has dismissed certain counts of the lawsuit, but has also ruled that the government may proceed with two counts under the federal RICO statute. On February 4, 2005, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the government may not, however, seek a disgorgement of defendants profits from the sale of tobacco as a part of its RICO claim. The trial began on September 15, 2004 with respect to all remaining claims and is ongoing. The Company is not a party to this action. On March 21, 2003, a judgment for $7.1 billion in compensatory and $3 billion in punitive damages was entered by an Illinois state court against Philip Morris, Inc. in Price, et al. v. Philip Morris, Inc., a class action alleging that certain advertising for light or low tar cigarettes was deceptive under the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act. Class actions involving similar allegations (Howard, et al. v. Brown Williamson Tobacco Corp. and Turner v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.) are pending against BW and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, respectively, in the same court. Trials in the Howard and Turner cases have been stayed pending appeal by Philip Morris in Price. The Company is not a party to the Price, Howard or Turner litigation. Resolution of Health Care Cost Recovery Actions by State, U.S. Territories and the District of Columbia In 1998, certain U.S. tobacco companies, including BW, entered into a Master Settlement Agreement (the MSA) with certain state attorneys general that resulted in the dismissal of all remaining health care reimbursement lawsuits brought by 52 government entities, including 46 States, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and the District of Columbia. Although the Company is not a party to the MSA and is not bound by any of its payment obligations or other restrictions, the Company understands that it is a released party under the terms of the MSA, which provides for the release of claims not only against participating manufacturers, but also against their predecessors, successors, and past, present and future affiliates. Under the MSA, participating manufacturers were required to make initial payments through 2003, with additional payments to the settling parties required to continue in perpetuity (starting at $4.5 billion in 2000 and increasing to $9 billion in 2018 and thereafter). Payments to a strategic contribution fund for individual states beginning in 2008 through 2017, and a public health foundation until 2008, are also required. Ongoing payments are to be allocated according to market share and are subject to various credits and adjustments, depending on industry volume. The MSA also calls for the participating manufacturers to pay attorneys fees for the States attorneys in the settled litigation. Prior to the MSA, health care cost recovery actions filed by the states of Minnesota, Texas, Florida and Mississippi were settled separately on terms which included monetary payments of several billion dollars. The Company was not a party to the Minnesota or Texas action and was voluntarily dismissed from the Florida and Mississippi actions. The Company is not a party to any of these settlements nor is it required to pay any money under these settlements. List of Pending Cases For a list of pending tobacco related cases, see Exhibit 99 to this Form 10 K. 14 List of Terminated Cases For a list of terminated tobacco related cases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10 K. Conclusion It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the pending litigation. However, management believes that there are a number of meritorious defenses to the pending actions, including the fact that the Company never made or sold tobacco, and these actions are being vigorously contested by the Indemnitor. Management believes that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company because it believes it has meritorious defenses and the Company is indemnified under the Indemnification Agreement. Spirits and Wine Litigation The Company, its Spirits and Wine business and numerous other manufacturers and importers of beer, spirits and wine are defendants in a purported consolidated class action lawsuit seeking damages and injunctive relief regarding alleged marketing of beverage alcohol to people under the legal purchase age for alcohol. The lawsuit, Eisenberg v. Anheuser Busch Inc., et al., was filed September 15, 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants have engaged in deceptive marketing practices and schemes targeted at people under the legal purchase age, negligently marketed their products to the underage and fraudulently concealed their alleged misconduct. Plaintiffs seek the disgorgement of unspecified profits earned by the Companys Spirits and Wine business in the past and the other unspecified damages an equitable relief. Other purported class actions are pending against other producers of alcoholic beverages for alleged marketing to persons under the legal drinking age. The Company denies that its Spirits and Wine business markets beverage alcohol products to persons under the legal purchase age and denies that the advertising practices of its Spirits and Wine business are illegal or in violation of industry codes concerning responsible marketing practices. It is not possible to predict the outcome of this action or give an estimate of a possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from this action. The Company believes, however, and counsel has advised that the Company and its Spirits and Wine business have meritorious defenses against plaintiffs claims. The Company is vigorously contesting this action and believes that ultimately it will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flow and financial condition of the Company.

We enhance shareholder value by building our leading consumer brands to drive sales, earn profits and generate cash. We do this by developing innovative new products and effective marketing campaigns, and expanding customer relationships. We also seek to increase profits by improving operations, increasing productivity and enhancing cost structures. While our first priority is internal growth, we also strive to achieve growth and high returns through acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. Finally, we enhance shareholder value through other initiatives such as using our financial resources to repurchase shares and pay attractive dividends. 2004 was an excellent year of broad based success for Fortune Brands. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 35% in 2004 to $783.8 million and $5.23, respectively. The increase in profits was due primarily to the benefit of strong operating performance, as well as tax related benefits, favorable foreign exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions. Net sales increased 18% to $7.3 billion, as a result of strong underlying growth, the benefit of acquisitions, favorable foreign exchange and price increases implemented to help offset commodity cost increases. As indicated below, each of our business segments achieved excellent performance in 2004: > Our Home and Hardware business achieved strong double digit growth in both operating income (24%) and sales (30%), resulting from successful line extensions and new product introductions, expanded customer relationships in cabinets and doors, the full year consolidation and growth of Therma Tru, as well as productivity improvements. Acquisitions contributed approximately half of the increase in sales. > Our Spirits and Wine business achieved 10% growth in operating income and 7% growth in sales due to strong worldwide volume growth for the Jim Beam bourbon brand, higher pricing and favorable foreign exchange. > On the strength of successful new products, our Golf brands achieved an 11% increase in operating income on 8% growth in sales. > Our Office business achieved 91% growth in operating income on a 7% increase in sales, benefiting from continuing savings from its repositioning program and sharper marketplace focus, as well as favorable foreign exchange. In 2005, the Company is well positioned for another year of strong performance. We believe the Company will benefit from the following trends in our businesses: > Aging population trends in the U.S. that favorably impact conditions in the home improvement, golf and spirits wine industries; > Additional favorable long term demographics of the home improvement and housing industries, particularly in the kitchen and bath segment, including rising household formations and increasing household wealth; > record existing home sales in 2004 and the effect of replace/remodel projects that often trail existing home sales by up to 12 to 18 months; > expanded customer relationships, particularly in Home and Hardware; > continued growth of key spirits and wine markets, especially the premium and super premium segments, and our investments behind our brands in these segments; > continuous innovation and international growth opportunities in our golf business; and > improving conditions in white collar employment, benefiting the office products industry. 21 The Company has also identified the following risks and challenges that may impact our businesses: > continued consolidation of the Companys trade customers and increased competition in private label products, particularly in the Office and Home Hardware businesses; > potential impact of changes in interest rates on the housing market; > possible continuing increases in commodity costs, particularly steel, particleboard and fuel related costs; and > impact of external conditions (economic conditions, weather, destination travel and corporate spending) on overall golf ball demand. Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Fortune Brands achieved strong results, as net sales increased 18% and net income increased 35%. Net sales grew as a result of: > strong growth for our consumer brands driven by share gains in key markets resulting from successful new products and expanded customer relationships, > the benefit of acquisitions, > solid market growth in Home Hardware and Spirits Wine markets, and > favorable foreign exchange. Net income increased on: > strong operating performance, > the benefit of acquisitions, > favorable foreign exchange, and > higher tax related benefits, partly offset by increased commodity costs. Our operating units will face challenges and opportunities unique to each of their industries, as discussed in this report. Net Sales Net sales increased $1,106.4 million, or 18%, to $7.3 billion. Sales benefited from: > newly introduced products and line extensions in the Home Hardware, Golf and Office businesses ($622 million in total), partly offset by lower sales of certain products being discontinued in the Golf, Office and the Home Hardware businesses, > the net impact ($388 million) of acquisitions (primarily Therma Tru) and dispositions, > expanded customer relationships driving increased volume, primarily in the cabinet and entry door businesses, and > favorable foreign exchange ($136 million). 22 Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $679.2 million, or 20%, on higher net sales and increased costs for major commodities (in the range of $65 70 million), particularly steel and particleboard, primarily in our Home Hardware and Office businesses, partly offset by supply chain efficiencies. Excise taxes on spirits and wine U.S. excise taxes on spirits and wine decreased as a percentage of sales due to greater international sales, as well as a favorable mix shift from mid tier brands to premium and super premium spirits and wines. In the U.S., excise taxes are levied based on the proof content of spirits and wine products. Consistent with industry practice, U.S. excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in sales and the corresponding payments to the government in cost of products sold. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $208.3 million, or 13%, as a result of higher sales and acquisitions, as well as increased advertising and marketing expenditures, partially offset by cost savings achieved as a result of our restructuring programs, particularly in our Office business. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles increased $17.8 million, or 94%, primarily due to amortization of identifiable intangibles associated with the acquisition of Therma Tru. Restructuring charges In 2004, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $29.2 million, compared to $19.5 million in 2003. Charges in 2004 principally related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and supply chain streamlining, largely in the Office and Home Hardware businesses. Other income, net Other income, net, increased $9.5 million to $50.2 million, primarily due to a $12.0 million gain recorded in 2004 as the result of insurance proceeds related to a Kentucky bourbon warehouse fire in 2003, partly offset by the lower tax related interest income. The components of other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: (In millions) 2004 2003 Amortization of deferred income $ 27.0 $ 27.0 Insurance proceeds from a Kentucky bourbon warehouse fire 12.0 Interest income on tax receivable 3.2 10.7 Other miscellaneous items 8.0 3.0 Total $ 50.2 $ 40.7 Income taxes Income taxes decreased $6.2 million, or 2%, on higher net income as we recorded higher tax related benefits in 2004 ($105.6 million) compared with 2003 ($35.0 million). The reported effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were 26.1% and 32.7%, respectively. The items set forth below impacted the effective income tax rate. During the third quarter of 2004, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its field examination phase of the routine review of our 1997 2001 tax returns. As a result of the audit, we recorded a net tax reserve reversal of $49.2 million. This net reversal accounts for the release of reserves for items resolved more favorably than anticipated, partly offset by the disallowance of a deduction for which no reserve had been established. 23 In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completed its review of the results of the routine IRS examination of our 1997 2001 tax returns. We recorded a total tax benefit of $53.0 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, reflecting the completion of the Joint Committee review. This resulted in a reversal of tax reserves of $39.5 million and a net tax adjustment of $13.5 million. As a result of the conclusion of the IRS examination of our 1997 2001 tax years, we expect to receive a tax refund of approximately $56 million in the first half of 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we also recorded a one time non operating adjustment for interest income on taxes receivable related to these tax related benefits of $2.1 million (after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, which was recorded in other income. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a tax benefit of $3.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, associated with foreign earnings repatriation under provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In 2003, the audit of our 1993 1996 tax returns resulted in a reduction in tax expense of $35 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. As a result, we also recorded a one time non operating adjustment of $6.9 million in interest income (after tax), which was recorded in other income. Net income Net income increased $204.6 million, or 35%, to $783.8 million due primarily to strong broad based operating performance, higher tax related benefits ($107.7 million in 2004 compared to $41.9 million in 2003), the benefit of favorable foreign exchange ($18 million) and the impact of acquisitions. Diluted earnings per share were $5.23 in 2004, up 35% from 2003. Pension Plans On a periodic basis, we evaluate the assumptions used in determining our pension liabilities and assets as well as pension expense based on historical returns on plan assets and current economic conditions at the time the assumptions are set. Our December 2003 review of the economic assumptions underlying our pension expense and year end disclosure led to a reduction in our weighted average discount rate from 6.6% to 6.1%. The weighted average expected rate of return remained unchanged at 8.3%. The 2003 revisions led to an increase of approximately $5 million in pension expense to $37.4 million in 2004. Our December 2004 review of the economic assumptions led to a reduction in our weighted average discount rate from 6.1% to 5.9%. The weighted average expected rate of return remained unchanged at 8.3%. Management believes that these assumptions are appropriate. The 2004 revisions will result in an increase to pension expense of approximately $4 million in 2005. Total pension plan cash contributions were $100.7 million and $123.5 million, respectively in 2004 and 2003. The Company maintains pension plans at each of its operations. The pension plans in aggregate are funded in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation. In 2005 we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $40 to $70 million to fund existing pension liabilities for our defined benefit plans. We believe that our internally generated funds will be adequate to make these pension plan cash contributions. International Performance We derived approximately 27% of our 2004 and 28% of our 2003 operating income from international markets, principally Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The decrease in the portion of operating income attributable to international markets resulted primarily from incremental sales from acquisitions, which were mainly in the U.S. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies may affect results in future periods. Fluctuations in average foreign exchange rates increased 2004 operating income by approximately 3%. We cannot accurately predict fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. A 10% change in average exchange rates for the foreign currencies from 2004 average rates would have resulted in a change in operating income of approximately $26 million, or about 2%. 24 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales Net sales increased $536.8 million, or 9.5%, to $6.2 billion. Sales benefited principally from increased volume associated with line extensions and the introduction of new products in our Golf and Home Hardware businesses ($241 million in aggregate), acquisitions ($220 million) including Omega in 2002 and favorable foreign exchange ($137 million). These benefits were partly offset by lower volumes in some existing product lines in the Office business, as well as the divestiture of the non strategic plumbing parts business of Home and Hardware in November 2002 ($53 million). Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $298.7 million, or 10%, primarily on higher sales. Excise taxes on spirits and wine U.S. excise taxes on spirits and wine decreased $9.1 million, or 3%, due to lower volume for some non premium products in the U.S. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $127.9 million, or 9%, on increased support for cabinet growth, golf marketing costs and commissions on higher sales. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles increased $2.8 million, or 17%, due to the full year amortization of finite lived intangibles for the 2002 Omega acquisition. Write down of identifiable intangibles We recorded a write down of identifiable intangibles of $12.0 million ($8.0 million after tax) to recognize the diminished values of certain trade names in conjunction with repositioning plans in our Office business. Restructuring charges In 2003, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $19.5 million. These charges principally related to the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities and employee termination costs in the Office business ($17.3 million), as well as the consolidation of ball plant facilities in the Golf business ($2.2 million). Of the $19.5 million in restructuring charges, $11.5 million related to disposal of assets, $6.9 million to employee terminations costs and $1.1 million to termination of lease agreements. Other income, net Other income, net, decreased $3.0 million to $40.7 million. The components of other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: (In millions) 2003 2002 Amortization of deferred income $ 27.0 $ 27.0 Interest income on tax receivable 10.7 14.9 Other miscellaneous items 3.0 1.8 Total $ 40.7 $ 43.7 25 Income taxes Income taxes increased $75.0 million, or 35%, as we recorded a lower tax related benefit in 2003 compared with 2002. The reported effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were 32.7% and 28.3%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was affected by the following items. During 2003, the audit of our 1993 1996 tax returns resulted in a reduction in tax expense of $35 million. During 2002, we recorded a $61.7 million tax benefit, which resulted from new IRS regulations that reinterpreted the capital loss disallowance rules. The new regulations enabled us to utilize a previously disallowed capital tax loss to offset capital gains taxed in 1996 and 1997. In addition, the 2003 effective rate was affected by non deductible non cash restructuring and restructuring related charges. Net income Net income increased $53.6 million, or 10%, to $579.2 million due primarily to strong broad based operating performance, the benefit of favorable foreign exchange ($23 million), lower restructuring charges ($16 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($15 million), in part offset by a lower tax related benefit than 2002 ($35.0 million in 2003 compared to $61.7 million in 2002). Diluted earnings per share were $3.86 in 2003, up 13% from 2002. Earnings per share benefited from higher net income and our share repurchase program. Pending Litigation See Note 23, Pending Litigaiton, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this 10 k. Environmental Matters Along with other responsible parties, our subsidiaries face claims relating to the protection of the environment. As of February 10, 2005, various of our subsidiaries had been designated as potentially responsible parties under Superfund or similar state laws in 60 instances. We have reached settlements in 40 of these instances. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other responsible parties or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we have accrued $46.2 million and $48.5 million, respectively, to cover these matters. Related Party Transactions Future Brands LLC In 2001, the Spirits and Wine business completed transactions with VS Vin Sprit AB (VS) creating the Future Brands joint venture, which distributes both companies spirits brands in the United States and provides related selling and invoicing services. Future Brands receives a commission from the partners for services provided. JBBCo. records revenue at the time of shipment to Future Brands customers. As part of forming this joint venture, JBBCo. has, in the event of default of Future Brands, a continuing obligation to satisfy any financial obligations of Future Brands that may arise in the event that Future Brands fails to fulfill its operating obligations and which results in a claim. These financial obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, JBBCo. did not hav e any outstanding obligations as a result of this arrangement. 26 JBBCo.s balances related to Future Brands included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Accounts receivable (invoicing by Future Brands on behalf of JBBCo.) $ 73.2 $ 73.5 $ 68.8 Investment 9.3 8.2 11.7 Accounts payable (commissions) 17.2 14.4 15.6 Accrued liabilities 7.2 24.7 29.1 Maxxium Worldwide B.V. In 1999, the Spirits and Wine business formed an international sales and distribution joint venture named Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (Maxxium) to distribute and sell spirits and wine in key markets outside the United States. The joint venture partners include Remy Cointreau, Highland Distillers and VS. JBBCo. records sales at the time spirits are sold to third parties rather than at the time of shipment to Maxxium. As a result of forming this joint venture, the Company has guaranteed certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $85 million, of which $76 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the guarantees totaled $79 million, of which $69 million was outstanding. JBBW has executed a Shareholder Loan Facility (Loan Facility) with Maxxium. There were no amounts outstanding under the Loan Facility as of either December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003. T he Loan Facility expires June 30, 2006. JBBCo.s balances related to Maximum included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Accounts receivable $ 60.1 $ 39.4 $ 34.6 Investment 64.6 64.9 64.3 Accounts payable (expense reimbursement) 13.7 16.0 12.3 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was effective for newly created variable interested entities as of January 31, 2003 and was effective for existing variable interest entities as of October 1, 2003. The objective of FIN 46 is to improve financial reporting by companies having transactions involving variable interest entities. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (FIN46R). FIN 46 and FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our results or financial position. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 106 2 (FSP 106 2), Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Prescription Act). FSP 106 2 provides guidance on the accounting for, and disclosure of, the effects of the Medicare Prescription Act enacted in December 2003. The Medicare Prescription Act will provide a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D, as well as provide a federal subsidy to employers that provide a program for prescription drug benefits that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. We adopted FSP 106 2 prospectively in the third quarter of 2004. Several of our postretirement plans qualify for the federal subsidy; however, the adoption of FSP 106 2 did not have a material impact on our results of operations. The subsidy, which will result in lower future expense, reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $10.9 million, or 6%. 27 In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109 2 (FSP 109 2), Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act provides for a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of FSP 109 2, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.4 million in 2004. See Note 13, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Share Based Payment. FAS 123R replaces FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. FAS 123R requires compensation expense, measured as the fair value at the grant date, related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. We intend to adopt FAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method as defined in FAS 123R. Under the modified prospective method, companies are required to record compensation cost for new and modified awards over the related vesting period of such awards prospectively and record compensation cost prospectively for the unvested portion, at the date of adopti on of FAS 123R, of previously issued and outstanding awards over the remaining vesting period of such awards. FAS 123R is effective for our third quarter 2005. We are evaluating the impact of FAS 123R on our results of operations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are described in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the following are the Companys critical accounting policies due to the more significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our assumptions and estimates, which are based on historical experience. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. Trade receivables do not include interest. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations, usually due to customers potential insolvency or early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns was $61.0 million and $63.5 million as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Inventories Inventories are priced at the lower of cost (principally first in, first out and average, with minor amounts at last in, first out) or market. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice, bulk whiskey inventories are classified as current assets, although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one year due to the duration of aging processes. Inventory reserves are recorded for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory turns and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes. 28 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided, principally on a straight line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses resulting from dispositions are included in income. Betterments and renewals, which improve and extend the life of an asset, are capitalized; maintenance and repair costs are expensed. Estimated useful lives of the related assets are as follows: Buildings and leasehold improvements 15 to 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Long lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, a long lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangibles) or asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate at the time of future cash flow derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated using a quoted market price, or if unavailable, using discounted expected future cash flows. The discount ra te applied to these cash flows is based on our weighted average cost of capital, which represents the blended after tax costs of debt and equity. Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangibles In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and under certain circumstances, written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is required if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. We use a rate corresponding to our cost of capital, risk adjusted where appropriate, in determining discounted cash flows. Estimated cash flows are then determined by disaggregating our business segments to a reporting level for which meaningful identifiable cash flows can be determined. When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangibles) and related goodwill, we perform an impairment test to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current a nd projected future levels of income as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. FAS 142 requires that purchased intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impact on that intangible. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, pricing, competition, technology) and internal factors (e.g., product costs, margins, support expenses, capital investment) and their potential impact on cash flows for each business in both the near and long term, as well as their impact on any identifiable intangible asset associated with the business. Based on recent business results, consideration of significant external and internal factors, and the resulting business 29 projections, indefinite lived intangible assets associated with that segment are reviewed to determine whether they are likely to remain indefinite lived, or whether a finite life is more appropriate. In addition, based on events in the period and future expectations, management considers whether the potential for impairment exists as required by FAS 142. Our predominant method of approximating fair value in determining whether an impairment exists is to use cash flow projections. We measure impairment based on discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the tradename compared to the carrying value of that tradename. When separate cash flow information is not available, we use the relief from royalty approach. Fair value is represented by the present value of hypothetical royalty income over the remaining useful life. Where information is not available to determine an appropriate royalty rate, we utilize a profit split methodology, which is a customary valuation practice, to establish a reasonable royalty rate. Profit split analyses allocate economic income (EBITDA less returns on working capital and fixed assets employed) between a tradename and residual assets of the economic unit to determine of the expected profit margin associated with commercialization of the tr adename. Additionally, independent valuation experts are used for periodic review and testing of managements assumptions relative to all significant trade valuations and lives, and for independent research on market and competitive dynamics. In conjunction with our ongoing review of the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles, in the year ended December 31, 2004, there were no write downs of intangible assets. In the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a non cash write down of identifiable intangibles of $12.0 million, $8.0 million after tax ($0.05 basic and diluted per share) to recognize the diminished values of certain trade names in conjunction with our repositioning plans in the Office business. Warranty Reserves We offer our customers various warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold. We determine warranty expense in accordance with the policy established at each operating company. The main consideration is historic claim experience, which is company specific based upon the nature of the product category. We generally record warranty expense in cost of products sold at the time of sale. Refer to Note 16, Product Warranties, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Warranty expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $33.9 million, $28.7 million and $23.4 million, respectively. Employee Benefit Plans We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement, post employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As required by United States generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of our modifications are generally recorded and amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the Companys plans are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our inde pendent actuaries. Pension expenses were $37.4 million, $28.1 million and $21.7 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Postretirement expenses were $14.1 million, $11.5 million and $10.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In 2005, we expect pension expense of approximately $41 million and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $15 million. A 25 basis point change (0.25%) in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension expense and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, 30 for 2005. A 25 basis point change in the long term rate of return used in accounting for the Companys pension plans would have a $2.6 million impact on pension expense. Income Taxes In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We do not provide for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to permanently reinvest. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were, in aggregate, $397.6 million at December 31, 2004. Revenue Recognition In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, we recognize revenue as products are shipped to customers, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. Criteria for recognition of revenue are whether title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We also provide for our estimate of potential bad debt at the time of revenue recognition. Amounts billed for shipping and handling are classified in net sales in the consolidated income statement. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are classified in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling costs included in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses were $285.3 million, $243.6 million and $234.5 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Customer Program Costs Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in many of our businesses. These businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sell through of that business products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume allowances, are accounted for as reductions to gross sales. These costs are recorded at the time of sale based on managements best estimates. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). Stock based Compensation We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the stock option plans. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, requires disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share amounts as if compensation expense was recognized. For the required disclosure, FAS 148 allows the use of a fair value method to measure compensation expense. Accordingly, we adopted the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine our compensation expense for disclosure purposes. The model requires the use of the following assumptions: an expected dividend yield; expected volatility; risk free interest rate; and expected term. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $16.47, $13.40 and $11.63, respectively, per option. Based upon the range provided for the assumptions utilized, any alternative fair values per option would not have materially differed from the fair values listed above. For example, a change in the expected term from 4.5 to 5 years, would have had a $0.78, or 5%, impact on the weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2004. Had FAS 148 been applied, the pro forma diluted 31 EPS impact would have been a decrease of $0.17, $0.12 and $0.10 per share, respectively, for 2004, 2003 and 2002. Derivative Financial Instruments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related amendment Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 (FAS 138), Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affe cts earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Derivative gains or losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, $2.3 million and $3.3 million in deferred losses, respectively, were reclassified to cost of products sold. We estimate that $9.6 million of derivative loss included in OCI as of December 31, 2004 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. Foreign Currency Risk Certain forecasted transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, Euro, Australian dollar and Pound sterling. Interest Rate Risk We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amounts. We record the payments or receipts on the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $200 million. The swap agreements are based on our outstanding 2.875% notes due in 2006 which allow the swap agreements to be classified as a fair value hedge in accordance with FAS 133. The agreements effectively convert the interest paid on $200 million of underlying debt securities from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on a LIBOR reference rate. Cost Initiatives We continuously evaluate the productivity of our supply chains and existing asset base, and actively seek to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure. Future opportunities may involve, among other things, the reorganization of operations, the relocation of manufacturing or assembly to locations generally having lower costs and the efficient sourcing of products or components from third party suppliers. Implementing any significant cost reduction and efficiency opportunities could result in charges. 32 Results of Operations by Segment Home and Hardware 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales increased $863.8 million, or 30%. The increase was attributable to the impact of acquisitions (Therma Tru, Capital Cabinets, American Lock, Dudley and Sentinel, in aggregate $382 million excluding internal growth), line extensions and new products ($317 million), expanded customer relationships (particularly in cabinets and entry doors), a robust housing market, and price increases on select products, as well as favorable foreign exchange ($24 million). Operating income increased $117.2 million, or 24%, on the benefit of acquisitions, higher sales and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher commodity costs, particularly steel and particleboard, and restructuring and restructuring related charges this year. In June 2004, Therma Tru acquired Sentinel Doors Ltd., a leading U.K. manufacturer and installer of complete composite entry door systems, and Master Lock acquired the assets of Dudley Inc., a leading brand of school locker locks in Canada. The aggregate purchase price of these two acquisitions was $30.9 million. In November 2003, the Home and Hardware business acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc., a leading manufacturer of residential entry door systems in the United States. The acquisition price was $924.0 million. In June 2003, MasterBrand Cabinets acquired Capital Cabinet Corporation, a U.S. based manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinets. In April 2003, Master Lock acquired American Lock Company, the largest U.S. based manufacturer of solid body commercial padlocks. In October 2003, Waterloo Industries announced plans to consolidate manufacturing from four facilities into three. Related to that action, in 2004 Waterloo recorded restructuring and restructuring related charges to complete the program. We expect that the Home and Hardware business will continue to benefit from expanding customer relationships as well as strong long term demographic trends supporting the home repair and remodeling and new home construction markets, particularly for kitchen and bath products and residential door systems. These trends include factors such as growth in the number of U.S. households, increases in household wealth and the aging of the housing stock. Our Home and Hardware business may be impacted by U.S. economic conditions, including mortgage interest rates, and their potential impact on the U.S. housing and remodeling markets. The business may also be affected by additional increases in the costs of certain commodities including higher fuel related costs, although these higher costs have been, and we believe will continue to be, largely offset by select price increases. In addition, the Home and Hardware business continues to face pricing pressure associated with consolidation of the industry customer base. This consolidation may also present opportunities for the most Efficient suppliers. 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $367.7 million, or 15%. The increase was attributable to strong underlying operating performance, the full year consolidation of Omega, acquired in 2002, and the acquisitions of Therma Tru, American Lock and Capital Cabinet ($163 million from acquisitions in aggregate), successful line extensions and new product introductions ($157 million), principally in cabinets and faucets, as well as expanded customer relationships. The sales growth was tempered by the absence of the divested plumbing parts business ($53 million) and soft retail volume in our tool storage business. 33 Operating income increased $82.8 million, or 21%, on higher sales, productivity improvements, and the absence of the low return plumbing product lines sold in 2002 ($4 million), partially offset by higher operating expenses, including increased commissions on higher sales, additional support for cabinet business growth and increased amortization of in store cabinet displays. Spirits and Wine 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales increased $78.3 million, or 7%, principally on favorable foreign exchange ($27 million), strong worldwide growth in Jim Beam bourbon, higher pricing for Jim Beam bourbon and mid tier brands in the U.S. and the acquisition of Wild Horse Winery. Operating income increased $30.9 million, or 10%, on the higher sales and favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by increased investment in key brand building initiatives. We expect that our Spirits and Wine business will benefit from growth in the premium and super premium spirits markets on which it focuses product development and marketing activities. Factors in the spirits and wine industry that could adversely affect results include possible further consolidation of suppliers, distributors and retailers, possible excise tax increases, increased regulation, class actions and or other litigation, and price competition. 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $58.5 million, or 6%, on the benefit of foreign exchange ($35 million), growth in underlying sales ($17 million), primarily Jim Beam ready to drink products in Australia, higher sales of DeKuyper cordials and super premium spirits in the U.S., and higher pricing for Jim Beam bourbon. These benefits were partly offset by decreased volumes for some non premium products in the U.S. Operating income increased $26.5 million, or 10%, benefiting from favorable foreign exchange and higher revenues, partly offset by increased selling and marketing administration costs ($12 million). Golf 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales increased $90.5 million, or 8%. The increase was attributable to continued volume growth across categories (golf clubs, golf balls, golf footwear, gloves and accessories $66 million) driven by the introduction of successful new golf products and line extensions, as well as favorable foreign exchange ($31 million). Operating income increased $14.7 million, or 11%, on higher sales, favorable foreign exchange and increased sales of higher margin Titleist golf balls. In April 2003, our Golf business announced plans to consolidate three golf ball manufacturing facilities into its two newest production facilities. This consolidation has created manufacturing efficiencies while preserving capacity to meet expected demand. Related to this consolidation, in 2004 we recorded $6.2 million in pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges to complete this program. The U.S. golf industry is highly competitive. Despite favorable demographics of an aging population (rounds of play increase with age), rounds of play in the U.S. have decreased over the past four years and were essentially flat in 2004 as a result of a combination of decreased golf related travel, economic conditions, lower corporate spending and weather conditions. While competitors with high inventories in the marketplace, especially for clubs, resorted to significant price discounting, retail inventories of our golf products were not excessive and we maintained relatively strong pricing on current products. The future success of our Golf business will depend upon continued innovation and marketing across product categories. 34 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $114.1 million, or 11%. The increase was led by significant share gains across all product categories benefiting from line extensions and the introduction of successful new golf club and golf ball products ($78 million), as well as favorable foreign exchange ($30 million) and favorable product mix. Our golf business achieved sales growth and share gains despite a 3% reduction in rounds of play in the U.S. Operating income increased $9.3 million, or 7%, benefiting from higher sales and favorable foreign exchange. The increase was partially offset by higher marketing costs, as well as restructuring related charges ($6 million). Office 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales increased $73.8 million, or 7%. The increase was principally related to favorable foreign exchange ($55 million) and higher sales in the U.S. driven by volume growth, including Kensington computer accessories, Swingline stapling products and Wilson Jones bindery products. Operating income increased $52.2 million, or 91%, to $109.8 million on the benefit of the business ongoing repositioning program, including successful supply chain realignment and cost reduction initiatives, favorable foreign exchange, and increases in sales volume, partly offset by higher commodity costs, particularly for steel. The office products industry is concentrated in a small number of major customers, principally office products superstores, large retailers, wholesalers and contract stationers. Customer consolidation and share growth of private label products continue to increase pricing pressures, which may adversely affect margins for our office products group and its competitors. The Office business addresses these challenges through design innovation, value added features and services. Since 2001, we have been repositioning and restructuring the Office business to improve both financial results and the long term value of the business. Under this plan, our Office business has significantly realigned and streamlined worldwide operations, intensified its focus on growing profitable core products, and reduced overhead expenses and excess capacity. We recorded the final charges for the restructuring program in the second quarter. In 2004, we recorded total pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of $27.6 million. We have reduced the business manufacturing and distribution square footage by approximately 40 percent, providing significant cost savings. These actions have also generated significant working capital improvements. 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales of $1.1 billion were flat with 2002. Sales benefited from favorable foreign exchange ($56 million) and new products, offset by lower sales in the U.S. and the U.K. due to soft industry conditions, including higher U.S. white collar unemployment, and the continued share gain of private label products. Operating income increased $30.2 million, or 110%, to $57.6 million benefiting from the business ongoing repositioning program, including successful cost reductions, as well as favorable foreign exchange. 35 Quarterly Financial Data Fortune Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries Unaudited (In millions, except per share amounts) 2004 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,707.8 $ 1,889.5 $ 1,812.1 $ 1,911.5 Gross profit 687.5 776.8 738.6 765.8 Operating income 229.6 295.9 285.8 312.0 Net income 139.7 167.8 226.8 249.5 Earnings per common share Basic $ .95 $ 1.15 1.57 $ 1.73 Diluted $ .92 $ 1.11 $ 1.52 $ 1.68 2003 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,392.1 $ 1,582.1 $ 1,583.8 $ 1,656.5 Gross profit 550.9 654.3 653.5 680.5 Operating income 172.6 240.4 238.9 265.6 Net income 99.5 176.7 146.1 156.9 Earnings per common share Basic $ .68 $ 1.22 1.01 $ 1.07 Diluted $ .66 $ 1.18 $ .98 $ 1.04 Financial Condition NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash generation continued to be strong in 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was $791.9 million compared with $790.7 million in 2003. The principal items impacting the change were higher net income in 2004, improved working capital efficiency and receipt of insurance proceeds from the Jim Beam warehouse fire last year, offset by higher working capital to support sales growth (accounts receivable and inventory), as well as the timing of accounts receivable payments receivable in 2005 instead of 2004 and the absence of a tax refund received in 2003. NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $245.3 million, compared to net cash used of $1,229.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The main reason for the decrease was less investment in acquisitions in 2004. Capital Expenditures We focus our capital spending on growth initiatives and becoming the lowest cost producers of the highest quality products. Capital expenditures in 2004 of $241.7 million were $48 million higher than 2003, primarily due to 2004 spending for Therma Tru, which Home and Hardware acquired in November 2003. We currently estimate 2005 capital expenditures will be in the range of $225 to $250 million. We expect to generate these funds internally. Acquisitions, Dispositions and Joint Ventures In 2004, Therma Tru acquired Sentinel Doors Ltd., a leading U.K. manufacturer and installer of complete composite entry door systems and Master Lock acquired the assets of Dudley Inc., a leading brand of school locker locks in Canada. The aggregate purchase price of these two acquisitions was $30.9 million. 36 In 2003, the Home and Hardware business acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc. for net cash of $924.0 million. In addition, our subsidiaries also acquired Wild Horse Winery, Capital Cabinet Corporation, American Lock Company and renewed licenses for Gilbeys gin and vodka and acquired trademark rights to the Kamchatka vodka brand in California. The aggregate cost of these acquisitions was $123.7 million. NET CASH PROVIDED AND USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $515.6 million, as compared to net cash provided of $515.4 million in 2003. The change of $1.0 billion was primarily due to issuance of long term debt of $599 million (net) in 2003 to fund the acquisition of Therma Tru and higher share repurchases in 2004. In November 2003, we acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc. for net cash of $924.0 million. Initial financing of the acquisition was executed with issuance of commercial paper and subsequently partially paid down with two long term debt issues totaling $600 million. This included $300 million of three year notes and $300 million of ten year notes. Dividends In 2004, we paid common dividends of $1.26 per share. Dividends paid to common stockholders in 2004 increased to $182.9 million from $166.9 million in 2003 as the increase in our dividend rate more than offset the lower shares outstanding. With the September 28, 2004 dividend payment, we increased the common stock quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.33 per share, or an indicated annual rate of $1.32 per share, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and operating performance, and our confidence in the Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2004, total debt decreased $63.8 million to $1.9 billion. Short term debt and long term debt decreased $60.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Our total debt to total capital ratio decreased to 34.8% at December 31, 2004 from 39.0% at December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily a result of lower debt coupled with higher equity due to net income in excess of dividends and share repurchases. At December 31, 2004, $2 billion of debt and equity securities were available for public sale under our universal shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At December 31, 2004, we maintained a $1.0 billion, five year revolving credit agreement with various banks, which the Company entered into in July 2004. The interest rate was set at the time of each borrowing. The facility fee of 0.08% per annum is subject to increases up to a maximum fee of 0.15% per annum in the event the long term debt rating falls below specified levels. Borrowings under the agreements are made for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases and support for the Companys short term borrowings in the commercial paper market. We believe that our internally generated funds, together with access to global credit markets, are adequate to meet our capital needs in both the short and long term. Working capital (current assets net of current liabilities) increased $457.8 million to $605.9 million at December 31, 2004. The principal reasons for the increase were higher accounts receivable primarily due to fourth quarter sales growth and increased inventories (to support growth at the Home and Hardware companies, and higher bulk inventories at Spirits and Wine), partly offset by improvements in working capital efficiency. 37 Foreign Exchange We have investments in various foreign countries, principally the United Kingdom, as well as Australia and Canada. Therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect our balance sheet and cash flow statements when translated into U.S. dollars. Interest Rates We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount. We record the payments or receipts on the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $200 million. The swap agreements are based on the outstanding 2.875% notes due in 2006 which allow the agreements to be classified as a fair value hedge in accordance with FAS 133. The agreements effectively convert the interest paid on $200 million of underlying debt securities from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on a LIBOR reference rate. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our $1,239.9 million and $1,443.1 million total long term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $1,341.8 million and $1,564.8 million, respectively. The fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. Minority Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased $3.9 million to $373.4 million. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity at year end 2004 increased $490.1 million principally due to higher net income, partly offset by dividends and share repurchases. We purchased, through open market purchases, $326.4 million (4.4 million shares) and $207.2 million (4.1 million shares) of common stock during 2004 and 2003, respectively. Common Stock Repurchase Program On February 24, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we could purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock from March 1, 2004 to February 28, 2005. In 2004, we repurchased an aggregate of 4.4 million shares of our common stock, at an average purchase price of $73.58 per share under this program. On February 22, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. The program authorizes our management to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions from March 1, 2005 to February 28, 2006. The program approved on February 22, 2005 replaces the similar program described above that expired on February 28, 2005. As with the prior program, our Board of Directors also granted authority to the Boards Executive Committee to authorize the purchase of upto an additional 5,000,000 shares on or prior to February 28, 2006 to the extent the Executive Committee determines it appropriate. 38 Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table and discussion represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2004. (In millions) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2004 Less than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Short term borrowings $ 669.8 $ 669.8 $ $ $ Long term debt 1,241.1 0.1 300.0 200.0 741.0 Capital lease obligations 0.6 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 247.0 55.5 78.0 49.6 63.9 Interest payments on long term debt 862.6 68.7 128.7 101.3 563.9 Purchase obligations(1) 653.7 388.6 146.0 114.2 4.9 Minimum pension obligations 9.5 4.8 4.7 (1) Purchase obligations include contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; advertising, selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures. In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2004. These include the guarantee of certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $85 million, of which no amount expires in less than one year with the entire $85 million due in one to three years; a Shareholder Loan Facility executed by JBBW and Maxxium amounting to $20 million, for which no amounts were outstanding and which expires in one to three years; Standby Letters of Credit of $54.1 million of which $40.6 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $13.5 million due in one to three years; and Surety Bonds of $22.0 million of which $21.5 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $0.5 million due in one to three years. In addition, VS holds an option which may require us to repurchase JBB W preferred stock, which VS purchased for $344.5 million net of returns of capital, at fair value in whole or in part any time after May 31, 2004 or upon a change in control of JBBW, JBBCo., or certain other events. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. In addition to the obligations described above, JBBCo. in the event of the default of Future Brands, is required to satisfy certain of Future Brands financial obligations. These obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. We do not have any other material off balance sheet obligations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The counterparties are major financial institutions. 39 Interest Rate Risk The disclosure about interest rate risk required to be provided under this item is set forth under Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis Financial Condition Interest Rates and is incorporated herein by reference. A hypothetical 20 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Companys variable rate borrowings would not have a material effect on results of operations. Foreign Exchange Contracts We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions. We periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. As indicated in the analysis that follows, the estimated potential loss under foreign exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value at risk (VAR) computation to estimate the potential economic loss that we could incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The VAR estimations are intended to measure the maximum amount of our loss from adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates, given a specified confidence level, over a given period of time. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques. The estimated fair value loss shown in the table below does not have a material impact on current results o f operations or financial condition. Also, the use of the VAR model should not be construed as an endorsement of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The following table summarizes our estimated loss under the VAR model as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (In millions) Estimated Amountof Loss Period Confidence Level 2004 foreign exchange $ 2.7 1 day 95 % 2003 foreign exchange $ 1.4 1 day 95 % The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange contracts would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of all outstanding contracts and the book value of the contracts were essentially the same. Commodities We are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. We use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility. The exposures under these contracts are not considered material to our financial statements. 40

We enhance shareholder value by building our leading consumer brands to drive sales, earn profits and generate cash. We do this by developing innovative new products and effective marketing campaigns, and expanding customer relationships. We also seek to increase profits by improving operations, increasing productivity and enhancing cost structures. While our first priority is internal growth, we also strive to achieve growth and high returns through acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. Finally, we enhance shareholder value through other initiatives such as using our financial resources to repurchase shares and pay attractive dividends. 2004 was an excellent year of broad based success for Fortune Brands. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 35% in 2004 to $783.8 million and $5.23, respectively. The increase in profits was due primarily to the benefit of strong operating performance, as well as tax related benefits, favorable foreign exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions. Net sales increased 18% to $7.3 billion, as a result of strong underlying growth, the benefit of acquisitions, favorable foreign exchange and price increases implemented to help offset commodity cost increases. As indicated below, each of our business segments achieved excellent performance in 2004: > Our Home and Hardware business achieved strong double digit growth in both operating income (24%) and sales (30%), resulting from successful line extensions and new product introductions, expanded customer relationships in cabinets and doors, the full year consolidation and growth of Therma Tru, as well as productivity improvements. Acquisitions contributed approximately half of the increase in sales. > Our Spirits and Wine business achieved 10% growth in operating income and 7% growth in sales due to strong worldwide volume growth for the Jim Beam bourbon brand, higher pricing and favorable foreign exchange. > On the strength of successful new products, our Golf brands achieved an 11% increase in operating income on 8% growth in sales. > Our Office business achieved 91% growth in operating income on a 7% increase in sales, benefiting from continuing savings from its repositioning program and sharper marketplace focus, as well as favorable foreign exchange. In 2005, the Company is well positioned for another year of strong performance. We believe the Company will benefit from the following trends in our businesses: > Aging population trends in the U.S. that favorably impact conditions in the home improvement, golf and spirits wine industries; > Additional favorable long term demographics of the home improvement and housing industries, particularly in the kitchen and bath segment, including rising household formations and increasing household wealth; > record existing home sales in 2004 and the effect of replace/remodel projects that often trail existing home sales by up to 12 to 18 months; > expanded customer relationships, particularly in Home and Hardware; > continued growth of key spirits and wine markets, especially the premium and super premium segments, and our investments behind our brands in these segments; > continuous innovation and international growth opportunities in our golf business; and > improving conditions in white collar employment, benefiting the office products industry. 21 The Company has also identified the following risks and challenges that may impact our businesses: > continued consolidation of the Companys trade customers and increased competition in private label products, particularly in the Office and Home Hardware businesses; > potential impact of changes in interest rates on the housing market; > possible continuing increases in commodity costs, particularly steel, particleboard and fuel related costs; and > impact of external conditions (economic conditions, weather, destination travel and corporate spending) on overall golf ball demand. Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Fortune Brands achieved strong results, as net sales increased 18% and net income increased 35%. Net sales grew as a result of: > strong growth for our consumer brands driven by share gains in key markets resulting from successful new products and expanded customer relationships, > the benefit of acquisitions, > solid market growth in Home Hardware and Spirits Wine markets, and > favorable foreign exchange. Net income increased on: > strong operating performance, > the benefit of acquisitions, > favorable foreign exchange, and > higher tax related benefits, partly offset by increased commodity costs. Our operating units will face challenges and opportunities unique to each of their industries, as discussed in this report. Net Sales Net sales increased $1,106.4 million, or 18%, to $7.3 billion. Sales benefited from: > newly introduced products and line extensions in the Home Hardware, Golf and Office businesses ($622 million in total), partly offset by lower sales of certain products being discontinued in the Golf, Office and the Home Hardware businesses, > the net impact ($388 million) of acquisitions (primarily Therma Tru) and dispositions, > expanded customer relationships driving increased volume, primarily in the cabinet and entry door businesses, and > favorable foreign exchange ($136 million). 22 Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $679.2 million, or 20%, on higher net sales and increased costs for major commodities (in the range of $65 70 million), particularly steel and particleboard, primarily in our Home Hardware and Office businesses, partly offset by supply chain efficiencies. Excise taxes on spirits and wine U.S. excise taxes on spirits and wine decreased as a percentage of sales due to greater international sales, as well as a favorable mix shift from mid tier brands to premium and super premium spirits and wines. In the U.S., excise taxes are levied based on the proof content of spirits and wine products. Consistent with industry practice, U.S. excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in sales and the corresponding payments to the government in cost of products sold. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $208.3 million, or 13%, as a result of higher sales and acquisitions, as well as increased advertising and marketing expenditures, partially offset by cost savings achieved as a result of our restructuring programs, particularly in our Office business. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles increased $17.8 million, or 94%, primarily due to amortization of identifiable intangibles associated with the acquisition of Therma Tru. Restructuring charges In 2004, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $29.2 million, compared to $19.5 million in 2003. Charges in 2004 principally related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and supply chain streamlining, largely in the Office and Home Hardware businesses. Other income, net Other income, net, increased $9.5 million to $50.2 million, primarily due to a $12.0 million gain recorded in 2004 as the result of insurance proceeds related to a Kentucky bourbon warehouse fire in 2003, partly offset by the lower tax related interest income. The components of other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: (In millions) 2004 2003 Amortization of deferred income $ 27.0 $ 27.0 Insurance proceeds from a Kentucky bourbon warehouse fire 12.0 Interest income on tax receivable 3.2 10.7 Other miscellaneous items 8.0 3.0 Total $ 50.2 $ 40.7 Income taxes Income taxes decreased $6.2 million, or 2%, on higher net income as we recorded higher tax related benefits in 2004 ($105.6 million) compared with 2003 ($35.0 million). The reported effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were 26.1% and 32.7%, respectively. The items set forth below impacted the effective income tax rate. During the third quarter of 2004, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its field examination phase of the routine review of our 1997 2001 tax returns. As a result of the audit, we recorded a net tax reserve reversal of $49.2 million. This net reversal accounts for the release of reserves for items resolved more favorably than anticipated, partly offset by the disallowance of a deduction for which no reserve had been established. 23 In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completed its review of the results of the routine IRS examination of our 1997 2001 tax returns. We recorded a total tax benefit of $53.0 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, reflecting the completion of the Joint Committee review. This resulted in a reversal of tax reserves of $39.5 million and a net tax adjustment of $13.5 million. As a result of the conclusion of the IRS examination of our 1997 2001 tax years, we expect to receive a tax refund of approximately $56 million in the first half of 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we also recorded a one time non operating adjustment for interest income on taxes receivable related to these tax related benefits of $2.1 million (after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, which was recorded in other income. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a tax benefit of $3.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, associated with foreign earnings repatriation under provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In 2003, the audit of our 1993 1996 tax returns resulted in a reduction in tax expense of $35 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. As a result, we also recorded a one time non operating adjustment of $6.9 million in interest income (after tax), which was recorded in other income. Net income Net income increased $204.6 million, or 35%, to $783.8 million due primarily to strong broad based operating performance, higher tax related benefits ($107.7 million in 2004 compared to $41.9 million in 2003), the benefit of favorable foreign exchange ($18 million) and the impact of acquisitions. Diluted earnings per share were $5.23 in 2004, up 35% from 2003. Pension Plans On a periodic basis, we evaluate the assumptions used in determining our pension liabilities and assets as well as pension expense based on historical returns on plan assets and current economic conditions at the time the assumptions are set. Our December 2003 review of the economic assumptions underlying our pension expense and year end disclosure led to a reduction in our weighted average discount rate from 6.6% to 6.1%. The weighted average expected rate of return remained unchanged at 8.3%. The 2003 revisions led to an increase of approximately $5 million in pension expense to $37.4 million in 2004. Our December 2004 review of the economic assumptions led to a reduction in our weighted average discount rate from 6.1% to 5.9%. The weighted average expected rate of return remained unchanged at 8.3%. Management believes that these assumptions are appropriate. The 2004 revisions will result in an increase to pension expense of approximately $4 million in 2005. Total pension plan cash contributions were $100.7 million and $123.5 million, respectively in 2004 and 2003. The Company maintains pension plans at each of its operations. The pension plans in aggregate are funded in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation. In 2005 we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $40 to $70 million to fund existing pension liabilities for our defined benefit plans. We believe that our internally generated funds will be adequate to make these pension plan cash contributions. International Performance We derived approximately 27% of our 2004 and 28% of our 2003 operating income from international markets, principally Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The decrease in the portion of operating income attributable to international markets resulted primarily from incremental sales from acquisitions, which were mainly in the U.S. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies may affect results in future periods. Fluctuations in average foreign exchange rates increased 2004 operating income by approximately 3%. We cannot accurately predict fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. A 10% change in average exchange rates for the foreign currencies from 2004 average rates would have resulted in a change in operating income of approximately $26 million, or about 2%. 24 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales Net sales increased $536.8 million, or 9.5%, to $6.2 billion. Sales benefited principally from increased volume associated with line extensions and the introduction of new products in our Golf and Home Hardware businesses ($241 million in aggregate), acquisitions ($220 million) including Omega in 2002 and favorable foreign exchange ($137 million). These benefits were partly offset by lower volumes in some existing product lines in the Office business, as well as the divestiture of the non strategic plumbing parts business of Home and Hardware in November 2002 ($53 million). Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $298.7 million, or 10%, primarily on higher sales. Excise taxes on spirits and wine U.S. excise taxes on spirits and wine decreased $9.1 million, or 3%, due to lower volume for some non premium products in the U.S. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $127.9 million, or 9%, on increased support for cabinet growth, golf marketing costs and commissions on higher sales. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles increased $2.8 million, or 17%, due to the full year amortization of finite lived intangibles for the 2002 Omega acquisition. Write down of identifiable intangibles We recorded a write down of identifiable intangibles of $12.0 million ($8.0 million after tax) to recognize the diminished values of certain trade names in conjunction with repositioning plans in our Office business. Restructuring charges In 2003, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $19.5 million. These charges principally related to the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities and employee termination costs in the Office business ($17.3 million), as well as the consolidation of ball plant facilities in the Golf business ($2.2 million). Of the $19.5 million in restructuring charges, $11.5 million related to disposal of assets, $6.9 million to employee terminations costs and $1.1 million to termination of lease agreements. Other income, net Other income, net, decreased $3.0 million to $40.7 million. The components of other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: (In millions) 2003 2002 Amortization of deferred income $ 27.0 $ 27.0 Interest income on tax receivable 10.7 14.9 Other miscellaneous items 3.0 1.8 Total $ 40.7 $ 43.7 25 Income taxes Income taxes increased $75.0 million, or 35%, as we recorded a lower tax related benefit in 2003 compared with 2002. The reported effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were 32.7% and 28.3%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was affected by the following items. During 2003, the audit of our 1993 1996 tax returns resulted in a reduction in tax expense of $35 million. During 2002, we recorded a $61.7 million tax benefit, which resulted from new IRS regulations that reinterpreted the capital loss disallowance rules. The new regulations enabled us to utilize a previously disallowed capital tax loss to offset capital gains taxed in 1996 and 1997. In addition, the 2003 effective rate was affected by non deductible non cash restructuring and restructuring related charges. Net income Net income increased $53.6 million, or 10%, to $579.2 million due primarily to strong broad based operating performance, the benefit of favorable foreign exchange ($23 million), lower restructuring charges ($16 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($15 million), in part offset by a lower tax related benefit than 2002 ($35.0 million in 2003 compared to $61.7 million in 2002). Diluted earnings per share were $3.86 in 2003, up 13% from 2002. Earnings per share benefited from higher net income and our share repurchase program. Pending Litigation See Note 23, Pending Litigaiton, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this 10 k. Environmental Matters Along with other responsible parties, our subsidiaries face claims relating to the protection of the environment. As of February 10, 2005, various of our subsidiaries had been designated as potentially responsible parties under Superfund or similar state laws in 60 instances. We have reached settlements in 40 of these instances. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other responsible parties or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we have accrued $46.2 million and $48.5 million, respectively, to cover these matters. Related Party Transactions Future Brands LLC In 2001, the Spirits and Wine business completed transactions with VS Vin Sprit AB (VS) creating the Future Brands joint venture, which distributes both companies spirits brands in the United States and provides related selling and invoicing services. Future Brands receives a commission from the partners for services provided. JBBCo. records revenue at the time of shipment to Future Brands customers. As part of forming this joint venture, JBBCo. has, in the event of default of Future Brands, a continuing obligation to satisfy any financial obligations of Future Brands that may arise in the event that Future Brands fails to fulfill its operating obligations and which results in a claim. These financial obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, JBBCo. did not hav e any outstanding obligations as a result of this arrangement. 26 JBBCo.s balances related to Future Brands included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Accounts receivable (invoicing by Future Brands on behalf of JBBCo.) $ 73.2 $ 73.5 $ 68.8 Investment 9.3 8.2 11.7 Accounts payable (commissions) 17.2 14.4 15.6 Accrued liabilities 7.2 24.7 29.1 Maxxium Worldwide B.V. In 1999, the Spirits and Wine business formed an international sales and distribution joint venture named Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (Maxxium) to distribute and sell spirits and wine in key markets outside the United States. The joint venture partners include Remy Cointreau, Highland Distillers and VS. JBBCo. records sales at the time spirits are sold to third parties rather than at the time of shipment to Maxxium. As a result of forming this joint venture, the Company has guaranteed certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $85 million, of which $76 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the guarantees totaled $79 million, of which $69 million was outstanding. JBBW has executed a Shareholder Loan Facility (Loan Facility) with Maxxium. There were no amounts outstanding under the Loan Facility as of either December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003. T he Loan Facility expires June 30, 2006. JBBCo.s balances related to Maximum included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Accounts receivable $ 60.1 $ 39.4 $ 34.6 Investment 64.6 64.9 64.3 Accounts payable (expense reimbursement) 13.7 16.0 12.3 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was effective for newly created variable interested entities as of January 31, 2003 and was effective for existing variable interest entities as of October 1, 2003. The objective of FIN 46 is to improve financial reporting by companies having transactions involving variable interest entities. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (FIN46R). FIN 46 and FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our results or financial position. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 106 2 (FSP 106 2), Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Prescription Act). FSP 106 2 provides guidance on the accounting for, and disclosure of, the effects of the Medicare Prescription Act enacted in December 2003. The Medicare Prescription Act will provide a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D, as well as provide a federal subsidy to employers that provide a program for prescription drug benefits that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. We adopted FSP 106 2 prospectively in the third quarter of 2004. Several of our postretirement plans qualify for the federal subsidy; however, the adoption of FSP 106 2 did not have a material impact on our results of operations. The subsidy, which will result in lower future expense, reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $10.9 million, or 6%. 27 In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109 2 (FSP 109 2), Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act provides for a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of FSP 109 2, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.4 million in 2004. See Note 13, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Share Based Payment. FAS 123R replaces FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. FAS 123R requires compensation expense, measured as the fair value at the grant date, related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. We intend to adopt FAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method as defined in FAS 123R. Under the modified prospective method, companies are required to record compensation cost for new and modified awards over the related vesting period of such awards prospectively and record compensation cost prospectively for the unvested portion, at the date of adopti on of FAS 123R, of previously issued and outstanding awards over the remaining vesting period of such awards. FAS 123R is effective for our third quarter 2005. We are evaluating the impact of FAS 123R on our results of operations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are described in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the following are the Companys critical accounting policies due to the more significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our assumptions and estimates, which are based on historical experience. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. Trade receivables do not include interest. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations, usually due to customers potential insolvency or early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns was $61.0 million and $63.5 million as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Inventories Inventories are priced at the lower of cost (principally first in, first out and average, with minor amounts at last in, first out) or market. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice, bulk whiskey inventories are classified as current assets, although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one year due to the duration of aging processes. Inventory reserves are recorded for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory turns and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes. 28 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided, principally on a straight line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses resulting from dispositions are included in income. Betterments and renewals, which improve and extend the life of an asset, are capitalized; maintenance and repair costs are expensed. Estimated useful lives of the related assets are as follows: Buildings and leasehold improvements 15 to 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Long lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, a long lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangibles) or asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate at the time of future cash flow derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated using a quoted market price, or if unavailable, using discounted expected future cash flows. The discount ra te applied to these cash flows is based on our weighted average cost of capital, which represents the blended after tax costs of debt and equity. Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangibles In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and under certain circumstances, written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is required if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. We use a rate corresponding to our cost of capital, risk adjusted where appropriate, in determining discounted cash flows. Estimated cash flows are then determined by disaggregating our business segments to a reporting level for which meaningful identifiable cash flows can be determined. When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangibles) and related goodwill, we perform an impairment test to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current a nd projected future levels of income as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. FAS 142 requires that purchased intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impact on that intangible. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, pricing, competition, technology) and internal factors (e.g., product costs, margins, support expenses, capital investment) and their potential impact on cash flows for each business in both the near and long term, as well as their impact on any identifiable intangible asset associated with the business. Based on recent business results, consideration of significant external and internal factors, and the resulting business 29 projections, indefinite lived intangible assets associated with that segment are reviewed to determine whether they are likely to remain indefinite lived, or whether a finite life is more appropriate. In addition, based on events in the period and future expectations, management considers whether the potential for impairment exists as required by FAS 142. Our predominant method of approximating fair value in determining whether an impairment exists is to use cash flow projections. We measure impairment based on discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the tradename compared to the carrying value of that tradename. When separate cash flow information is not available, we use the relief from royalty approach. Fair value is represented by the present value of hypothetical royalty income over the remaining useful life. Where information is not available to determine an appropriate royalty rate, we utilize a profit split methodology, which is a customary valuation practice, to establish a reasonable royalty rate. Profit split analyses allocate economic income (EBITDA less returns on working capital and fixed assets employed) between a tradename and residual assets of the economic unit to determine of the expected profit margin associated with commercialization of the tr adename. Additionally, independent valuation experts are used for periodic review and testing of managements assumptions relative to all significant trade valuations and lives, and for independent research on market and competitive dynamics. In conjunction with our ongoing review of the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles, in the year ended December 31, 2004, there were no write downs of intangible assets. In the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a non cash write down of identifiable intangibles of $12.0 million, $8.0 million after tax ($0.05 basic and diluted per share) to recognize the diminished values of certain trade names in conjunction with our repositioning plans in the Office business. Warranty Reserves We offer our customers various warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold. We determine warranty expense in accordance with the policy established at each operating company. The main consideration is historic claim experience, which is company specific based upon the nature of the product category. We generally record warranty expense in cost of products sold at the time of sale. Refer to Note 16, Product Warranties, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Warranty expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $33.9 million, $28.7 million and $23.4 million, respectively. Employee Benefit Plans We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement, post employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As required by United States generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of our modifications are generally recorded and amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the Companys plans are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our inde pendent actuaries. Pension expenses were $37.4 million, $28.1 million and $21.7 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Postretirement expenses were $14.1 million, $11.5 million and $10.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In 2005, we expect pension expense of approximately $41 million and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $15 million. A 25 basis point change (0.25%) in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension expense and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, 30 for 2005. A 25 basis point change in the long term rate of return used in accounting for the Companys pension plans would have a $2.6 million impact on pension expense. Income Taxes In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We do not provide for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to permanently reinvest. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were, in aggregate, $397.6 million at December 31, 2004. Revenue Recognition In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, we recognize revenue as products are shipped to customers, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. Criteria for recognition of revenue are whether title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We also provide for our estimate of potential bad debt at the time of revenue recognition. Amounts billed for shipping and handling are classified in net sales in the consolidated income statement. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are classified in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling costs included in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses were $285.3 million, $243.6 million and $234.5 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Customer Program Costs Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in many of our businesses. These businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sell through of that business products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume allowances, are accounted for as reductions to gross sales. These costs are recorded at the time of sale based on managements best estimates. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). Stock based Compensation We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the stock option plans. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, requires disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share amounts as if compensation expense was recognized. For the required disclosure, FAS 148 allows the use of a fair value method to measure compensation expense. Accordingly, we adopted the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine our compensation expense for disclosure purposes. The model requires the use of the following assumptions: an expected dividend yield; expected volatility; risk free interest rate; and expected term. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $16.47, $13.40 and $11.63, respectively, per option. Based upon the range provided for the assumptions utilized, any alternative fair values per option would not have materially differed from the fair values listed above. For example, a change in the expected term from 4.5 to 5 years, would have had a $0.78, or 5%, impact on the weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2004. Had FAS 148 been applied, the pro forma diluted 31 EPS impact would have been a decrease of $0.17, $0.12 and $0.10 per share, respectively, for 2004, 2003 and 2002. Derivative Financial Instruments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related amendment Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 (FAS 138), Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affe cts earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Derivative gains or losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, $2.3 million and $3.3 million in deferred losses, respectively, were reclassified to cost of products sold. We estimate that $9.6 million of derivative loss included in OCI as of December 31, 2004 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. Foreign Currency Risk Certain forecasted transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, Euro, Australian dollar and Pound sterling. Interest Rate Risk We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amounts. We record the payments or receipts on the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $200 million. The swap agreements are based on our outstanding 2.875% notes due in 2006 which allow the swap agreements to be classified as a fair value hedge in accordance with FAS 133. The agreements effectively convert the interest paid on $200 million of underlying debt securities from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on a LIBOR reference rate. Cost Initiatives We continuously evaluate the productivity of our supply chains and existing asset base, and actively seek to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure. Future opportunities may involve, among other things, the reorganization of operations, the relocation of manufacturing or assembly to locations generally having lower costs and the efficient sourcing of products or components from third party suppliers. Implementing any significant cost reduction and efficiency opportunities could result in charges. 32 Results of Operations by Segment Home and Hardware 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales increased $863.8 million, or 30%. The increase was attributable to the impact of acquisitions (Therma Tru, Capital Cabinets, American Lock, Dudley and Sentinel, in aggregate $382 million excluding internal growth), line extensions and new products ($317 million), expanded customer relationships (particularly in cabinets and entry doors), a robust housing market, and price increases on select products, as well as favorable foreign exchange ($24 million). Operating income increased $117.2 million, or 24%, on the benefit of acquisitions, higher sales and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher commodity costs, particularly steel and particleboard, and restructuring and restructuring related charges this year. In June 2004, Therma Tru acquired Sentinel Doors Ltd., a leading U.K. manufacturer and installer of complete composite entry door systems, and Master Lock acquired the assets of Dudley Inc., a leading brand of school locker locks in Canada. The aggregate purchase price of these two acquisitions was $30.9 million. In November 2003, the Home and Hardware business acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc., a leading manufacturer of residential entry door systems in the United States. The acquisition price was $924.0 million. In June 2003, MasterBrand Cabinets acquired Capital Cabinet Corporation, a U.S. based manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinets. In April 2003, Master Lock acquired American Lock Company, the largest U.S. based manufacturer of solid body commercial padlocks. In October 2003, Waterloo Industries announced plans to consolidate manufacturing from four facilities into three. Related to that action, in 2004 Waterloo recorded restructuring and restructuring related charges to complete the program. We expect that the Home and Hardware business will continue to benefit from expanding customer relationships as well as strong long term demographic trends supporting the home repair and remodeling and new home construction markets, particularly for kitchen and bath products and residential door systems. These trends include factors such as growth in the number of U.S. households, increases in household wealth and the aging of the housing stock. Our Home and Hardware business may be impacted by U.S. economic conditions, including mortgage interest rates, and their potential impact on the U.S. housing and remodeling markets. The business may also be affected by additional increases in the costs of certain commodities including higher fuel related costs, although these higher costs have been, and we believe will continue to be, largely offset by select price increases. In addition, the Home and Hardware business continues to face pricing pressure associated with consolidation of the industry customer base. This consolidation may also present opportunities for the most Efficient suppliers. 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $367.7 million, or 15%. The increase was attributable to strong underlying operating performance, the full year consolidation of Omega, acquired in 2002, and the acquisitions of Therma Tru, American Lock and Capital Cabinet ($163 million from acquisitions in aggregate), successful line extensions and new product introductions ($157 million), principally in cabinets and faucets, as well as expanded customer relationships. The sales growth was tempered by the absence of the divested plumbing parts business ($53 million) and soft retail volume in our tool storage business. 33 Operating income increased $82.8 million, or 21%, on higher sales, productivity improvements, and the absence of the low return plumbing product lines sold in 2002 ($4 million), partially offset by higher operating expenses, including increased commissions on higher sales, additional support for cabinet business growth and increased amortization of in store cabinet displays. Spirits and Wine 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales increased $78.3 million, or 7%, principally on favorable foreign exchange ($27 million), strong worldwide growth in Jim Beam bourbon, higher pricing for Jim Beam bourbon and mid tier brands in the U.S. and the acquisition of Wild Horse Winery. Operating income increased $30.9 million, or 10%, on the higher sales and favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by increased investment in key brand building initiatives. We expect that our Spirits and Wine business will benefit from growth in the premium and super premium spirits markets on which it focuses product development and marketing activities. Factors in the spirits and wine industry that could adversely affect results include possible further consolidation of suppliers, distributors and retailers, possible excise tax increases, increased regulation, class actions and or other litigation, and price competition. 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $58.5 million, or 6%, on the benefit of foreign exchange ($35 million), growth in underlying sales ($17 million), primarily Jim Beam ready to drink products in Australia, higher sales of DeKuyper cordials and super premium spirits in the U.S., and higher pricing for Jim Beam bourbon. These benefits were partly offset by decreased volumes for some non premium products in the U.S. Operating income increased $26.5 million, or 10%, benefiting from favorable foreign exchange and higher revenues, partly offset by increased selling and marketing administration costs ($12 million). Golf 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales increased $90.5 million, or 8%. The increase was attributable to continued volume growth across categories (golf clubs, golf balls, golf footwear, gloves and accessories $66 million) driven by the introduction of successful new golf products and line extensions, as well as favorable foreign exchange ($31 million). Operating income increased $14.7 million, or 11%, on higher sales, favorable foreign exchange and increased sales of higher margin Titleist golf balls. In April 2003, our Golf business announced plans to consolidate three golf ball manufacturing facilities into its two newest production facilities. This consolidation has created manufacturing efficiencies while preserving capacity to meet expected demand. Related to this consolidation, in 2004 we recorded $6.2 million in pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges to complete this program. The U.S. golf industry is highly competitive. Despite favorable demographics of an aging population (rounds of play increase with age), rounds of play in the U.S. have decreased over the past four years and were essentially flat in 2004 as a result of a combination of decreased golf related travel, economic conditions, lower corporate spending and weather conditions. While competitors with high inventories in the marketplace, especially for clubs, resorted to significant price discounting, retail inventories of our golf products were not excessive and we maintained relatively strong pricing on current products. The future success of our Golf business will depend upon continued innovation and marketing across product categories. 34 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales increased $114.1 million, or 11%. The increase was led by significant share gains across all product categories benefiting from line extensions and the introduction of successful new golf club and golf ball products ($78 million), as well as favorable foreign exchange ($30 million) and favorable product mix. Our golf business achieved sales growth and share gains despite a 3% reduction in rounds of play in the U.S. Operating income increased $9.3 million, or 7%, benefiting from higher sales and favorable foreign exchange. The increase was partially offset by higher marketing costs, as well as restructuring related charges ($6 million). Office 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales increased $73.8 million, or 7%. The increase was principally related to favorable foreign exchange ($55 million) and higher sales in the U.S. driven by volume growth, including Kensington computer accessories, Swingline stapling products and Wilson Jones bindery products. Operating income increased $52.2 million, or 91%, to $109.8 million on the benefit of the business ongoing repositioning program, including successful supply chain realignment and cost reduction initiatives, favorable foreign exchange, and increases in sales volume, partly offset by higher commodity costs, particularly for steel. The office products industry is concentrated in a small number of major customers, principally office products superstores, large retailers, wholesalers and contract stationers. Customer consolidation and share growth of private label products continue to increase pricing pressures, which may adversely affect margins for our office products group and its competitors. The Office business addresses these challenges through design innovation, value added features and services. Since 2001, we have been repositioning and restructuring the Office business to improve both financial results and the long term value of the business. Under this plan, our Office business has significantly realigned and streamlined worldwide operations, intensified its focus on growing profitable core products, and reduced overhead expenses and excess capacity. We recorded the final charges for the restructuring program in the second quarter. In 2004, we recorded total pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of $27.6 million. We have reduced the business manufacturing and distribution square footage by approximately 40 percent, providing significant cost savings. These actions have also generated significant working capital improvements. 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales of $1.1 billion were flat with 2002. Sales benefited from favorable foreign exchange ($56 million) and new products, offset by lower sales in the U.S. and the U.K. due to soft industry conditions, including higher U.S. white collar unemployment, and the continued share gain of private label products. Operating income increased $30.2 million, or 110%, to $57.6 million benefiting from the business ongoing repositioning program, including successful cost reductions, as well as favorable foreign exchange. 35 Quarterly Financial Data Fortune Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries Unaudited (In millions, except per share amounts) 2004 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,707.8 $ 1,889.5 $ 1,812.1 $ 1,911.5 Gross profit 687.5 776.8 738.6 765.8 Operating income 229.6 295.9 285.8 312.0 Net income 139.7 167.8 226.8 249.5 Earnings per common share Basic $ .95 $ 1.15 1.57 $ 1.73 Diluted $ .92 $ 1.11 $ 1.52 $ 1.68 2003 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,392.1 $ 1,582.1 $ 1,583.8 $ 1,656.5 Gross profit 550.9 654.3 653.5 680.5 Operating income 172.6 240.4 238.9 265.6 Net income 99.5 176.7 146.1 156.9 Earnings per common share Basic $ .68 $ 1.22 1.01 $ 1.07 Diluted $ .66 $ 1.18 $ .98 $ 1.04 Financial Condition NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash generation continued to be strong in 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was $791.9 million compared with $790.7 million in 2003. The principal items impacting the change were higher net income in 2004, improved working capital efficiency and receipt of insurance proceeds from the Jim Beam warehouse fire last year, offset by higher working capital to support sales growth (accounts receivable and inventory), as well as the timing of accounts receivable payments receivable in 2005 instead of 2004 and the absence of a tax refund received in 2003. NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $245.3 million, compared to net cash used of $1,229.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The main reason for the decrease was less investment in acquisitions in 2004. Capital Expenditures We focus our capital spending on growth initiatives and becoming the lowest cost producers of the highest quality products. Capital expenditures in 2004 of $241.7 million were $48 million higher than 2003, primarily due to 2004 spending for Therma Tru, which Home and Hardware acquired in November 2003. We currently estimate 2005 capital expenditures will be in the range of $225 to $250 million. We expect to generate these funds internally. Acquisitions, Dispositions and Joint Ventures In 2004, Therma Tru acquired Sentinel Doors Ltd., a leading U.K. manufacturer and installer of complete composite entry door systems and Master Lock acquired the assets of Dudley Inc., a leading brand of school locker locks in Canada. The aggregate purchase price of these two acquisitions was $30.9 million. 36 In 2003, the Home and Hardware business acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc. for net cash of $924.0 million. In addition, our subsidiaries also acquired Wild Horse Winery, Capital Cabinet Corporation, American Lock Company and renewed licenses for Gilbeys gin and vodka and acquired trademark rights to the Kamchatka vodka brand in California. The aggregate cost of these acquisitions was $123.7 million. NET CASH PROVIDED AND USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $515.6 million, as compared to net cash provided of $515.4 million in 2003. The change of $1.0 billion was primarily due to issuance of long term debt of $599 million (net) in 2003 to fund the acquisition of Therma Tru and higher share repurchases in 2004. In November 2003, we acquired Therma Tru Holdings, Inc. for net cash of $924.0 million. Initial financing of the acquisition was executed with issuance of commercial paper and subsequently partially paid down with two long term debt issues totaling $600 million. This included $300 million of three year notes and $300 million of ten year notes. Dividends In 2004, we paid common dividends of $1.26 per share. Dividends paid to common stockholders in 2004 increased to $182.9 million from $166.9 million in 2003 as the increase in our dividend rate more than offset the lower shares outstanding. With the September 28, 2004 dividend payment, we increased the common stock quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.33 per share, or an indicated annual rate of $1.32 per share, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and operating performance, and our confidence in the Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2004, total debt decreased $63.8 million to $1.9 billion. Short term debt and long term debt decreased $60.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Our total debt to total capital ratio decreased to 34.8% at December 31, 2004 from 39.0% at December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily a result of lower debt coupled with higher equity due to net income in excess of dividends and share repurchases. At December 31, 2004, $2 billion of debt and equity securities were available for public sale under our universal shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At December 31, 2004, we maintained a $1.0 billion, five year revolving credit agreement with various banks, which the Company entered into in July 2004. The interest rate was set at the time of each borrowing. The facility fee of 0.08% per annum is subject to increases up to a maximum fee of 0.15% per annum in the event the long term debt rating falls below specified levels. Borrowings under the agreements are made for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases and support for the Companys short term borrowings in the commercial paper market. We believe that our internally generated funds, together with access to global credit markets, are adequate to meet our capital needs in both the short and long term. Working capital (current assets net of current liabilities) increased $457.8 million to $605.9 million at December 31, 2004. The principal reasons for the increase were higher accounts receivable primarily due to fourth quarter sales growth and increased inventories (to support growth at the Home and Hardware companies, and higher bulk inventories at Spirits and Wine), partly offset by improvements in working capital efficiency. 37 Foreign Exchange We have investments in various foreign countries, principally the United Kingdom, as well as Australia and Canada. Therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect our balance sheet and cash flow statements when translated into U.S. dollars. Interest Rates We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount. We record the payments or receipts on the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $200 million. The swap agreements are based on the outstanding 2.875% notes due in 2006 which allow the agreements to be classified as a fair value hedge in accordance with FAS 133. The agreements effectively convert the interest paid on $200 million of underlying debt securities from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on a LIBOR reference rate. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our $1,239.9 million and $1,443.1 million total long term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $1,341.8 million and $1,564.8 million, respectively. The fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. Minority Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased $3.9 million to $373.4 million. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity at year end 2004 increased $490.1 million principally due to higher net income, partly offset by dividends and share repurchases. We purchased, through open market purchases, $326.4 million (4.4 million shares) and $207.2 million (4.1 million shares) of common stock during 2004 and 2003, respectively. Common Stock Repurchase Program On February 24, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we could purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock from March 1, 2004 to February 28, 2005. In 2004, we repurchased an aggregate of 4.4 million shares of our common stock, at an average purchase price of $73.58 per share under this program. On February 22, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. The program authorizes our management to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions from March 1, 2005 to February 28, 2006. The program approved on February 22, 2005 replaces the similar program described above that expired on February 28, 2005. As with the prior program, our Board of Directors also granted authority to the Boards Executive Committee to authorize the purchase of upto an additional 5,000,000 shares on or prior to February 28, 2006 to the extent the Executive Committee determines it appropriate. 38 Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table and discussion represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2004. (In millions) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2004 Less than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Short term borrowings $ 669.8 $ 669.8 $ $ $ Long term debt 1,241.1 0.1 300.0 200.0 741.0 Capital lease obligations 0.6 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 247.0 55.5 78.0 49.6 63.9 Interest payments on long term debt 862.6 68.7 128.7 101.3 563.9 Purchase obligations(1) 653.7 388.6 146.0 114.2 4.9 Minimum pension obligations 9.5 4.8 4.7 (1) Purchase obligations include contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; advertising, selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures. In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2004. These include the guarantee of certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $85 million, of which no amount expires in less than one year with the entire $85 million due in one to three years; a Shareholder Loan Facility executed by JBBW and Maxxium amounting to $20 million, for which no amounts were outstanding and which expires in one to three years; Standby Letters of Credit of $54.1 million of which $40.6 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $13.5 million due in one to three years; and Surety Bonds of $22.0 million of which $21.5 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $0.5 million due in one to three years. In addition, VS holds an option which may require us to repurchase JBB W preferred stock, which VS purchased for $344.5 million net of returns of capital, at fair value in whole or in part any time after May 31, 2004 or upon a change in control of JBBW, JBBCo., or certain other events. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. In addition to the obligations described above, JBBCo. in the event of the default of Future Brands, is required to satisfy certain of Future Brands financial obligations. These obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. We do not have any other material off balance sheet obligations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The counterparties are major financial institutions. 39 Interest Rate Risk The disclosure about interest rate risk required to be provided under this item is set forth under Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis Financial Condition Interest Rates and is incorporated herein by reference. A hypothetical 20 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Companys variable rate borrowings would not have a material effect on results of operations. Foreign Exchange Contracts We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions. We periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. As indicated in the analysis that follows, the estimated potential loss under foreign exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value at risk (VAR) computation to estimate the potential economic loss that we could incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The VAR estimations are intended to measure the maximum amount of our loss from adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates, given a specified confidence level, over a given period of time. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques. The estimated fair value loss shown in the table below does not have a material impact on current results o f operations or financial condition. Also, the use of the VAR model should not be construed as an endorsement of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The following table summarizes our estimated loss under the VAR model as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (In millions) Estimated Amountof Loss Period Confidence Level 2004 foreign exchange $ 2.7 1 day 95 % 2003 foreign exchange $ 1.4 1 day 95 % The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange contracts would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of all outstanding contracts and the book value of the contracts were essentially the same. Commodities We are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. We use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility. The exposures under these contracts are not considered material to our financial statements. 40
