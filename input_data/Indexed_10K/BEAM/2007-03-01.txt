We enhance shareholder value by profitably building our leading consumer brands to drive sales and earnings as well as to generate cash. We do this by developing innovative new products and effective marketing campaigns, and expanding customer relationships. We also seek to increase profits by improving operations, increasing productivity and enhancing cost structures. While our first priority is internal growth, we also strive to achieve growth and high returns through acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. Finally, we enhance shareholder value through other initiatives such as using our financial resources to repurchase shares and pay attractive dividends. 24 Net income increased 34% and diluted earnings per share increased 31% in 2006 to $830.1 million and $5.42, respectively. The increase in profits was due primarily to underlying sales growth, the benefit of acquisitions, the absence of 2005 currency hedge accounting expense related to the exchange rate on the day the Spirits and Wine acquisition closed ($0.72 per diluted share) and substantial tax credits recorded in 2006 ($0.57 per diluted share). This increase was partly offset by the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" (FAS 123R), which was adopted January 1, 2006 (an incremental $0.16 per diluted share), higher restructuring and restructuring related charges (incremental $0.07 per share) and the absence of income due to the spin off of the Office products business last year ($0.26 per diluted share). On a continuing operations basis, income increased 43% and diluted earnings per share increased 40% in 2006. Each of our business segments performed well in 2006: Our Home and Hardware business achieved 13% growth in sales and 6% growth in operating income, as a result of successful line extensions and new product introductions, expanding customer relationships in cabinetry and residential entry doors, as well as the benefit of the addition of Simonton and aggressive cost management. These benefits were partly offset by the impact of the downturn in the U.S. housing market, and restructuring and restructuring related costs related to supply chain initiatives. Even with the challenging market conditions, our home products brands outperformed the home products market and continued to gain share. Our Spirits and Wine business achieved 68% growth in sales and 78% growth in operating income, primarily on the full year benefit of the Spirits and Wine acquisition, as well as worldwide volume growth in premium and super premium spirits, and favorable foreign exchange. On the strength of sales growth in all product categories and successful new products in golf clubs and golf shoes, our Golf brands achieved a 4% increase in sales. Operating income was down 3%, adversely impacted by higher raw materials costs and FAS 123R expensing of stock option compensation. In January 2006, we substantially completed the final legal transfer of the spirits and wine assets we acquired in July 2005. As a result of the Spirits and Wine acquisition, in January 2006 we refinanced a portion of the short term debt utilized for the acquisition and issued both dollar and euro denominated long term debt in the amount of $2 billion and &euro;800 million (approximately $1 billion). Refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions, Disposals and Joint Ventures" and Note 6, "Long Term Debt," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In June 2006, we acquired SBR, Inc. (now Simonton Holdings, Inc.), a privately held company, which owns a leading vinyl framed window brand in North America. Refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions, Disposals and Joint Ventures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2007, we believe the Company will benefit from the following trends in our businesses: continued growth of premium spirits and wine worldwide; sustained innovation and new product development across all of our segments; international growth opportunities in all of our segments; expanding customer relationships, particularly in Home and Hardware; and aging population trends in the U.S. that favorably impact conditions in the home improvement, golf and spirits & wine industries. The Company has also identified the following risks and challenges that may impact our businesses: negative impact of the downturn in the overall U.S. home products market, which could decline at a double digit rate in 2007; 25 possible continuing increases in commodities costs, particularly copper and zinc, as well as earnings volatility created by mark to market accounting on commodity hedges; and impact of external conditions (economic conditions, weather, destination travel and corporate spending) on overall demand for golf products; and continued consolidation of the Companys trade customers, particularly in the Home & Hardware business. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2006 Compared to 2005 Fortune Brands achieved a 24% increase in net sales and a 29% increase in operating income. Income from continuing operations was up 43% and net income was up 34%. Net income benefited from: the full year benefit of the Spirits and Wine acquisition (acquired July 2005), underlying growth in the Home and Hardware, Spirits & Wine and Golf businesses, successful new products and line extensions, expanding customer relationships and extending brands into new markets, brand investments and share gain initiatives, price increases, including those implemented to help offset energy and raw material cost increases, the absence of last years currency hedge accounting expense related to the Spirits and Wine acquisition purchase price and higher tax credits this year. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of FAS 123R stock option compensation cost, higher restructuring and restructuring related costs this year and the absence of income due to the spin off of the Office products business. Our operating units will face challenges and opportunities unique to each of their industries, as discussed in this report. Net Sales Net sales from continuing operations increased $1.7 billion, or 24%, to $8.8 billion. Sales benefited from: newly introduced products and line extensions across all businesses, the net impact of the Spirits & Wine and Simonton acquisitions ($1.2 billion in aggregate), select price increases, across all of our businesses, but particularly in Home and Hardware, including those to help offset energy and raw material cost increases, expanding customer relationships, particularly for the cabinetry and entry door brands, extending brands into new markets and favorable foreign exchange ($42 million). The increase in net sales was tempered by the impact of the downturn in the U.S. housing market, particularly in the second half of 2006. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $775.9 million, or 20%, as a result of the Spirits & Wine and Simonton acquisitions, higher net sales, increased year over year costs for energy and raw material costs 26 (approximately $45 million), which were largely offset by price increases, as well as productivity improvements. Excise taxes on spirits and wine U.S. excise taxes on spirits and wine increased as a percentage of sales by approximately 120 basis points due to a higher percentage of Spirits and Wine sales in Fortune Brands total revenues as a result of the 2005 Spirits and Wine acquisition. In the U.S., excise taxes are levied based on the proof content of spirits and wine products. Consistent with industry practice, U.S. excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in sales and the corresponding payments to the government in cost of sales. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $375.7 million, or 22%, primarily as a result of the Spirits and Wine acquisition. In addition, increases were due to higher sales, increased advertising for new product introductions and higher brand investment expenses in all business segments, as well as stock option compensation cost. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles increased $10.1 million to $43.5 million primarily due to amortization of finite lived intangible assets associated with the Spirits and Wine acquisition ($5.5 million), as well as amortization associated with the Simonton acquisition ($4.6 million). Restructuring charges For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $21.2 million. These charges principally related to consolidation of manufacturing facilities and workforce reductions in the Home & Hardware and Spirits & Wine businesses. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we did not record any restructuring charges. Restructuring projects provide a return in excess of our cost of capital with an expected payback of less than three years. Interest expense Interest expense increased $173.5 million, or 109.2%, to $332.4 million primarily as a result of debt associated with the Spirits & Wine and Simonton acquisitions, as well as higher interest rates. Other expense (income), net Other expense (income), net increased $119.1 million to $40.2 million of income. The increase was primarily due to the absence of 2005s unfavorable impact of currency hedge accounting expense related to the Spirits and Wine acquisition purchase price ($120.9 million). Income taxes Income taxes decreased $13.4 million, or 4%, to $311.1 million. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was 25.7% and 35.0%, respectively. The lower effective rate primarily related to higher tax credits this year associated with recently enacted reductions of foreign income tax rates applied to foreign deferred income taxes, as well as favorable resolution of routine federal and state tax audits. 27 Net income Net income was $830.1 million, or $5.56 per basic share and $5.42 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. These results compared to net income of $621.1 million, or $4.26 per basic share and $4.13 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Income from continuing operations (same as net income for 2006) was $830.1 million, or $5.56 per basic share and $5.42 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. These results compared to income from continuing operations of $581.6 million, or $3.99 per basic share and $3.87 diluted per share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net income of $209.0 million, or 34%, was primarily due to the benefit of the Spirits and Wine acquisition, underlying growth in all businesses, the absence of the 2005 currency hedge accounting expense related to the Spirits and Wine acquisition purchase price ($109.0 million or $0.72 per diluted share) and substantial tax credits recorded in 2006 ($86.5 million in 2006 compared to $7.7 million in 2005, or an increase of $0.52 per diluted share). These benefits were partly offset by higher restructuring and restructuring related costs (incremental $15.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share), stock option compensation cost ($25.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share) and the absence of income due to the spin off of the Office products business ($0.26 per diluted share for discontinued operations in 2006). 2005 Compared to 2004 Fortune Brands achieved a 15% increase in net sales and a 14% increase in operating income. Net income was down 21% primarily due to currency hedge accounting expense related to the Spirits and Wine acquisition purchase price, substantial tax credits recorded in 2004 and the absence of income due to the spin off of the Office products business. Net income benefited from strong broad based operating performance in all three business segments. The sales increase was driven by: growth in the Home and Hardware, Spirits & Wine and Golf businesses, successful new products and line extensions and expanding customer relationships, the impact of the Spirits and Wine acquisition, price increases, primarily those implemented in 2004 to help offset energy and raw material cost increases and favorable foreign exchange. Net income benefited from increased sales volume. However, the benefit was more than offset by: currency hedge accounting expense related to the Spirits and Wine acquisition purchase price, tax credits recorded in 2004 and the absence of income due to the spin off of the Office products business. Net Sales Net sales from continuing operations increased $916.0 million, or 15%, to $7.1 billion. Sales benefited from: newly introduced products and line extensions across all businesses ($564 million in total), the net impact ($472 million in aggregate) of acquisitions (primarily the Spirits and Wine acquisition $444 million) and minor dispositions, price increases (approximately $64 million, primarily in the Home & Hardware and Golf businesses) to help offset energy and raw material cost increases, expanding customer relationships, particularly in the cabinetry and entry door brands and favorable foreign exchange ($27 million). 28 The increase in net sales was partly offset by lower sales ($260 million) of certain products being discontinued and replaced by new products in the Golf business, as well as a decrease in sales of Home and Hardware tool storage products as a result of weak volumes at Sears. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $500.8 million, or 15%, on the impact of the Spirits and Wine acquisition ($205.0 million), higher net sales, increased year over year costs for energy and raw material costs (in the range of $80 to 85 million), which were largely offset by price increases and a $7.9 million unfavorable steel purchase price variance for LIFO inventory in the Home and Hardware tool storage category. This variance, which occurred in 2004, was identified and recorded in 2005. Excise taxes on spirits and wine U.S. excise taxes on spirits and wine decreased as a percentage of sales by approximately 25 basis points due to higher international sales (including the Spirits and Wine acquisition that have a higher concentration of sales in international markets). In the U.S., excise taxes are levied based on the proof content of spirits and wine products. Consistent with industry practice, U.S. excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in sales and the corresponding payments to the government in cost of sales. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $260.9 million, or 18%, primarily as a result of the Spirits and Wine acquisition ($128.1 million). In addition, increases were due to higher sales, increased advertising for new product introductions and higher brand investment expenses in Home & Hardware and Spirits & Wine, as well as due to restructuring related integration costs associated with the Spirits and Wine acquisition ($18.4 million). Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles decreased $2.0 million to $33.4 million primarily due to a 2004 first quarter amortization adjustment related to the finalization of purchase accounting associated with the 2003 Therma Tru acquisition ($2.6 million), partly offset by amortization of finite lived intangible assets associated with the Spirits and Wine acquisition ($0.5 million). Restructuring charges For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we did not record any restructuring charges. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $9.8 million. The charges principally related to consolidation of manufacturing facilities and workforce reductions, mainly in the Home and Hardware business. Interest expense Interest expense increased $81.6 million, or 105.6% to $158.9 million primarily as a result of higher debt associated with the Spirits and Wine acquisition. Other expense (income), net Other expense (income), net increased $125.9 million to a net expense of $78.9 million primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency hedge accounting expense related to the Spirits and Wine acquisition purchase price ($120.9 million). 29 Income taxes Income taxes increased $63.4 million, or 24% to $324.5 million. The reported effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 was 35.0% and 26.3%, respectively. The higher effective rate primarily related to a low tax benefit associated with acquisition related currency hedge accounting expense this year, as well as lower tax credits in 2005 compared to 2004. Net income Net income was $621.1 million, or $4.26 per basic share and $4.13 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. These results compared to net income of $783.8 million, or $5.40 per basic share and $5.23 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income from continuing operations was $581.6 million, or $3.99 per basic share and $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. These results compared to income from continuing operations of $716.0 million, or $4.93 per basic share and $4.78 diluted per share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in income from continuing operations of $134.4 million, or 19%, was primarily due to currency hedge accounting expense related to the Spirits and Wine acquisition purchase price ($109.0 million or $0.72 per diluted share), lower tax credits ($7.7 million in 2005 compared to $103.7 million in 2004, or a decrease of $0.64 per diluted share) and the absence of income due to the spin off of the Office products business. Income from continuing operations benefited from higher sales volume. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $28.3 million, or 42%, primarily as a result of the absence of income after the spin off of the Office products business on August 16, 2005. 30 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA Fortune Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries Unaudited (In millions, except per share amounts) 2006 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 2,016.8 $ 2,257.1 $ 2,218.5 $ 2,276.6 Gross profit 811.4 969.1 907.5 951.4 Operating income 306.9 433.6 379.5 381.3 Net income 173.4 247.8 151.3 257.6 Earnings per common share Basic $ 1.18 $ 1.68 $ 1.00 $ 1.70 Diluted $ 1.15 $ 1.63 $ 0.98 $ 1.65 2005 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,517.8 $ 1,782.8 $ 1,801.6 $ 1,959.0 Gross profit 616.5 751.5 729.4 794.3 Operating income 231.6 332.5 294.5 305.3 Income from continuing operations 142.6 183.8 79.3 175.9 Income from discontinued operations 10.1 16.5 12.9 Net income 152.7 200.3 92.2 175.9 Earnings per common share Basic Income from continuing operations $ 0.98 $ 1.26 $ 0.54 $ 1.20 Net income $ 1.05 $ 1.38 $ 0.63 $ 1.20 Diluted Income from continuing operations $ 0.95 $ 1.22 $ 0.52 $ 1.17 Net income $ 1.02 $ 1.33 $ 0.61 $ 1.17 31  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Home and Hardware 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales increased $540.8 million, or 13%, to $4,694.2 million. The increase was primarily attributable to continued growth and share gains for cabinetry, faucet and padlock brands, as well as the benefit of acquisitions ($344 million), primarily the Simonton acquisition. Sales also benefited from new products and line extensions ($43 million in total), expanding customer relationships with home centers and major builders, expansion into adjacent categories (e.g., bath accessories, patio doors, impact resistant windows and automotive towing accessories), growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange ($23 million). In addition, sales benefited from price increases implemented to help offset higher costs for raw materials and energy. The net sales increase was tempered by the impact of the downturn in the overall U.S. home products market, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating income increased $40.3 million, or 6%, to $695.4 million. Operating income benefited from sales growth, productivity improvements and reversal of a legal reserve (approximately $7 million), as well as absence of both expenses in 2006 related to a lower cost sourcing initiative in cabinets in 2005 and an unfavorable steel purchase price variance for LIFO inventory in the tool storage category in 2005 ($7.9 million). These benefits were partially offset by higher commodity and energy costs (net impact approximately $30 35 million), restructuring and restructuring related charges ($26.3 million) and the inclusion of stock option compensation cost beginning in 2006 upon the adoption of FAS 123R. In June 2006, the Home and Hardware business acquired SBR, Inc. (Simonton), including Simonton Windows, a leading brand of vinyl framed windows. Simonton products are manufactured and sold primarily in the United States. We expect the downturn in the overall U.S. home products market, which could decline at a double digit rate in 2007, to continue to impact results for our home products brands. The impact will be mitigated by proactive cost controls to better align supply chain and administrative costs with expected demand. However, we believe that we are well positioned to continue outperforming the market due to our sustained share gains, successful extension of brands into new markets, expanding customer relationships and strong presence in the less cyclical replace and remodel segment of the housing market. Our business may also be affected by increases in the costs of certain commodities, although we will continue working to offset higher costs with productivity initiatives and select price increases. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net sales increased $389.7 million, or 10%, to $4,153.4 million. The increase was primarily due to underlying volume growth fueled by line extensions and new products ($346 million in total, mainly in faucets, cabinetry and exterior doors), expanding customer relationships (particularly in the cabinetry and residential entry door brands), and raw material related price increases on select products, as well as benefits from acquisitions made in 2005 and 2004 ($28 million increase in sales net of a disposition last year) and favorable foreign exchange ($13 million). The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower tool storage sales due to weak volumes at Sears. Operating income increased $56.6 million, or 9%, to $655.1 million on the higher sales and the absence of restructuring related charges in 2005 ($14.5 million), partially offset by an unfavorable inventory adjustment in the tool storage category, higher energy related costs and costs for capacity and global supply chain initiatives for cabinets. The unfavorable inventory adjustment was a $7.9 million steel purchase price variance 32 for LIFO inventory in the tool storage category, which occurred in 2004. It was identified and recorded in 2005. Spirits and Wine 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales increased $1,119.4 million, or 68%, to $2,761.4 million principally due to the addition of net sales from the Spirits and Wine acquisition not in the prior year ($826 million), as well as year over year sales growth in the combined business and favorable foreign exchange ($22 million). Growth for brands including Jim Beam bourbon, Sauza tequila, Makers Mark bourbon and Clos du Bois wines, as well as super premium brands and several regional/national brands, contributed to the increase. Reported net sales in 2005 were impacted by accounting for the acquisition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." Prior to the legal transfer of acquired brands and assets (refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions, Disposals and Joint Ventures" to the Consolidated Financial Statements), we consolidated variable interest entities where we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Certain entities consolidated at December 31, 2006 were not consolidated as of December 31, 2005, and certain assets or liabilities consolidated as of December 31, 2005 are no longer owned by entities consolidated as of December 31, 2006. Operating income increased $313.0 million, or 78%, to $714.0 million on the benefit of higher sales, synergy benefits from the Spirits and Wine acquisition and lower transition costs, partly offset by the inclusion of stock option compensation cost beginning in 2006. Operating income margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately $90 million recorded as revenues that generated no operating income, primarily related to short term cost only transitional bottling agreements with Pernod Ricard S.A. (Pernod Ricard). In addition, operating income was affected by accounting under FIN 46R. See discussion of FIN 46R below. Factors that could adversely affect results include potential changes to distribution, competitive pricing activities, increased regulation, class actions and or other litigation and the possibility of excise and other tax increases, including internationally. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net sales increased $472.7 million, or 40%, to $1,642.0 million principally due to the impact of the Spirits and Wine Acquired Assets ($444 million). Sales also benefited from higher U.S. sales of premium and super premium spirits, including the new Starbucks Coffee Liqueur, strong case volume growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange ($5 million), partly offset by lower sales of non premium brands in the U.S. Operating income increased $67.3 million, or 20%, to $401.0 million on higher sales, partly offset by brand spending to support the launch of Starbucks Coffee Liqueur and restructuring related integration costs ($18.4 million). Operating income was affected by accounting under FIN 46R. Since many of the assets we acquired were owned by entities that also owned assets acquired by Pernod Ricard, in accordance with FIN 46R, we fully consolidated entities for which we were the primary beneficiary even for the brands and assets which Pernod Ricard ultimately owned. We were the primary beneficiary if we had the obligation to absorb the majority of the expected losses and the right to receive the majority of the expected residual returns of an entity. In addition, if the fair value of the assets acquired by us was less than 50% of the fair value of the entity, we accounted for the investment using the cost method, meaning that sales and expenses related to the brands and assets to be acquired by Fortune Brands in those entities were not included in our statement of income on a fully consolidated basis. Therefore, the reported sales and operating income are not representative of future results of operations. Refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions, Disposals and Joint Ventures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of the accounting treatment of this acquisition. 33 Golf 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales increased $47.6 million, or 4%, to $1,313.4 million. Higher sales resulted from sales growth in all product categories, driven in part by successful new products in golf clubs and golf shoes, and continued growth in international markets (Europe and Asia). Operating income decreased $5.5 million, or 3%, to $166.0 million primarily due to higher commodity and energy costs (approximately $8 10 million) and the inclusion of stock option compensation cost beginning this year. We expect the golf industry to benefit from favorable long term demographic trends, including an aging U.S. population (rounds of play increase with age). In the near term, participation levels are impacted by factors including weather, economic conditions, golf related travel and corporate spending. U.S. rounds of play were flat in 2004 and 2005, and up modestly in 2006. The future success of the Golf business will depend upon continued innovation, product quality and successful marketing across product categories, as well as continued growth in international markets. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net sales increased $53.6 million, or 4%, to $1,265.8 million. The increase was attributable to sales growth in all product categories, new product introductions in golf clubs, and a favorable mix shift toward the premium Titleist brand balls and clubs, as well as favorable foreign exchange ($9 million). Operating income increased $17.7 million, or 12%, to $171.5 million on higher sales, a favorable mix shift toward higher margin Titleist branded golf balls and clubs, favorable foreign exchange and the absence of restructuring related charges ($6 million). Corporate 2006 Compared to 2005 Corporate expenses of $74.1 million, which include salaries, benefits and expenses related to corporate office employees, increased $10.4 million, or 16%, primarily due to the required expensing of stock option compensation cost beginning in 2006 upon adoption of FAS 123R. 2005 Compared to 2004 Corporate expenses of $63.7 million, which include salaries, benefits and expenses related to corporate office employees, increased $2.3 million, or 4%, primarily due to higher litigation expenses. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, service indebtedness and pay dividends, as well as finance acquisitions and share repurchases when deemed appropriate. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, commercial paper, borrowings under our credit agreements and long term notes. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. Currently, our focus for the use of our free cash flow, after internal growth and dividends, is the reduction of debt incurred as a result of the Spirits and Wine acquisition in order to further increase our financial flexibility. Despite this current focus on debt reduction, we have in the past, and will continue to, periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate strategic options to increase 34 shareholder value. We cannot predict whether or when we may enter into an acquisition, disposition, joint venture or other strategic transaction, nor what impact any such transaction could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. For a description of the debt, see " Capitalization" below and Note 6, "Long Term Debt," and Note 13, "Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a description of the Spirits and Wine acquisition, see Note 4, "Acquisitions, Disposals and Joint Ventures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows Net cash provided from operating activities was $982.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $802.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in cash provided of $180.0 million was principally due to higher cash flow in the Home & Hardware business (partly due to lower working capital increases as a result of slower fourth quarter growth) and Spirits & Wine business (primarily on higher net income), and the favorable timing of interest payments on newly issued debt. Working capital (current assets net of current liabilities) increased $1,039.9 million to $1,414.7 million at December 31, 2006, primarily due to consolidation of balance sheet accounts from Spirits and Wine acquired assets transferred in January 2006 (net $406 million increase) and higher net cash flow, as well as higher Spirits and Wine inventory. Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $762.3 million, compared with $4,664.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease of $3,901.9 million was primarily due to payments in 2005 for the Spirits and Wine acquisition ($4,898.8 million) less a dividend from the spin off of ACCO World Corporation ($613.3 million), partly offset by payments in 2006 for the Spirits and Wine acquisition ($309.5 million) and the Simonton acquisition ($271.4 million). We focus our capital spending on growth initiatives and becoming the lowest cost producers of the highest quality products. Capital expenditures in 2006 of $181.4 million were $34.2 million lower than 2005, primarily due to the sale of selected assets. We currently estimate 2007 net capital expenditures will be in the range of $225 to $250 million. We expect to generate these funds internally. Net cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $145.5 million, as compared to net cash provided of $3,783.7 million in 2005. The change of $3,929.2 million was primarily attributable to higher debt as a result of the Spirits and Wine acquisition last year, partly offset by proceeds of $153.0 million received from V&S Group in order to maintain a 10% interest in the Spirits and Wine business. Capitalization Total debt of $5.8 billion was essentially the same at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The ratio of total debt to total capital decreased to 52.4% at December 31, 2006 from 59.2% at December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of higher equity mainly due to higher net income ($830.1 million), and debt assumed and stock issued for the acquisition of Simonton ($297.9 million), partly offset by lower debt due to cash flow from operations. In May 2006, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a new universal shelf registration statement, covering the offer and sale of an undetermined amount of various securities. We have two revolving credit agreements with various banks. These agreements include a $2.0 billion, 5 year revolving credit agreement, which matures in 2010, and a $500 million, 364 day revolving credit agreement. On October 5, 2006 we renewed our 364 day revolving credit facility to mature in 2007. The agreement includes the option to extend payment for one year at the Companys discretion for an incremental fee of 0.125% of the outstanding amount. This facility replaces the previous 364 day facility under which there were no amounts outstanding. The interest rates, which are variable, are based on market interest rates at the time 35 of the borrowing and the Companys long term credit rating. Facility fees of 0.08% per annum are subject to increases up to maximum fees of 0.15% per annum in the event our long term debt rating falls below specified levels. The facility supports the Companys commercial paper borrowings in the commercial paper market. At December 31, 2005, we had a $3.0 billion bridge credit agreement. The bridge credit agreement was terminated upon issuance of new long term debt. In January 2006, we issued long term debt securities totaling $2.0 billion under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $2.0 billion of notes consists of $750 million of 5.125% notes due January 2011, $950 million of 5.375% notes due January 2016 and $300 million of 5.875% notes due January 2036. Net proceeds of $1,977.4 million were less price discounts of $9.3 million and underwriting fees of $13.3 million. The stated coupon rate for each debt issue approximates the effective interest rate, excluding hedging gains or losses. Proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper issued in connection with the Spirits and Wine acquisition. In addition, in January 2006, we issued long term debt securities totaling &euro;800 million (approximately $1 billion) in a transaction exempt from registration in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. The &euro;800 million notes consist of &euro;300 million of 3.5% notes due January 2009 and &euro;500 million of 4% notes due January 2013. Net proceeds of &euro;794.5 million were less price discounts of &euro;3.1 million and underwriting fees of &euro;2.4 million. The stated coupon rate for each debt issue approximates the effective interest rate, excluding hedging gains or losses. Proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper issued in connection with the Spirits and Wine acquisition and borrowings under the bridge credit agreement. See Note 6, "Long Term Debt," for additional information on the new debt. Refer to Note 13, "Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements on treasury rate locks associated with the U.S. denominated long term debt. Spin off of Office Products Business As a part of the spin off of the Office products business on August 16, 2005, ACCO World Corporation (the Office products business) paid a cash dividend of $625 million, of which Fortune Brands received $613.3 million and the minority shareholder received $11.7 million. The fact that Fortune Brands will no longer receive any of the cash flows from ACCO World Corporation as a result of the spin off is not expected to have a material impact on the long term liquidity of the Company. Spirits and Wine Acquisition On April 21, 2005, we announced that we would acquire certain spirits and wine brands as well as distribution assets from Pernod Ricard for approximately $5.25 billion. In July, 2005, we closed on the purchase. See Note 4, "Acquisitions, Disposals and Joint Ventures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition, including 2006 purchase price adjustments. Currently, we intend to utilize our cash flow after net capital expenditures and dividend payments to pay down the debt incurred to finance this acquisition. The operations of the newly acquired Spirits and Wine business generate positive cash flow after interest payments on the debt incurred as a result of the acquisition. Simonton Acquisition On June 7, 2006, we closed on the acquisition of SBR, Inc. (Simonton), a privately held company with brands including Simonton Windows, a leading vinyl framed window brand in North America. The purchase price was approximately $599.8 million (based on the price of Fortune Brands common stock at closing) and was paid with a combination of stock, cash and assumed debt. Based on this valuation, the stock component was 50% of the total purchase price. We assumed $85.9 million of Simontons debt of which $55.4 million was paid off at closing. 36 Dividends A summary of 2006 cash dividend activity for the Companys common stock is shown below. On July 25, 2006, we increased our quarterly dividend on common stock by 8% from $0.36 per share to $0.39 per share. Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date $0.36 per share January 24, 2006 February 8, 2006 March 1, 2006 $0.36 per share April 25, 2006 May 10, 2006 June 1, 2006 $0.39 per share July 25, 2006 August 9, 2006 September 1, 2006 $0.39 per share September 26, 2006 November 8, 2006 December 1, 2006 A summary of 2006 dividend activity for the Companys $2.67 Convertible Preferred Stock is shown below: Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date $0.6675 per share January 24, 2006 February 8, 2006 March 10, 2006 $0.6675 per share April 25, 2006 May 10, 2006 June 10, 2006 $0.6675 per share July 25, 2006 August 9, 2006 September 10, 2006 $0.6675 per share September 26, 2006 November 8, 2006 December 10, 2006 We currently expect to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, but such payments are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors, including those set forth under "Business Cautionary Statement." Pension Plans On a periodic basis, we evaluate the assumptions used in determining our pension liabilities and assets as well as pension expense based on historical returns on plan assets and current economic conditions at the time the assumptions are set. Our December 2006 review of the economic assumptions, and our cash flow spot rate yield curve analysis, led to an increase in our weighted average discount rate from 5.7% to 5.9% and the weighted average expected rate of return decreased from 8.3% to 8.2%. Management believes that these assumptions are appropriate. The 2006 revisions will result in a decrease to pension and postretirement expense of approximately $3.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in 2007. Our December 2005 review of the economic assumptions, and our cash flow spot rate yield curve analysis, led to a reduction in our weighted average discount rate from 5.9% to 5.7%. The weighted average expected rate of return on assets remained unchanged at 8.3%. Management believes that these assumptions are appropriate. The 2005 revisions resulted in an increase to total pension and postretirement expense of approximately $4 million in 2006. Total pension plan cash contributions were $18.1 million and $48.0 million, respectively, in 2006 and 2005. The Company maintains pension plans at many of its operations. The pension plans in aggregate are funded in excess of the Current Liability, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. In 2007, we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $30 to $50 million to fund existing pension liabilities for our defined benefit plans. We believe that our internally generated funds will be adequate to make these pension plan cash contributions. 37 Adequacy of Liquidity Sources We believe that our internally generated funds, together with access to global credit markets, are adequate to meet our long term and short term capital needs, including those resulting from our Spirits and Wine Acquired Assets. However, our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Item 1. "Business Cautionary Statement." Foreign Exchange We have investments in various foreign countries, principally Australia, Canada, Mexico, Spain, the U.K. and France. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our balance sheet and cash flow statements when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, in 2006 we issued euro denominated long term debt. We have designated the euro denominated debt as net investment hedges of euro functional currency operations. See Note 6, "Long Term Debt," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rates We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount. We record the payments or receipts under the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. We also may, from time to time, enter into treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with fluctuation in interest rates related to anticipated issuance of new long term debt. In the second quarter of 2005, we entered into treasury rate locks with an aggregate notional value of $1.25 billion in order to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to the anticipated issuances of the dollar denominated debt associated with the Spirits and Wine acquisition. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we entered into additional treasury rate locks with an aggregate notional value of $500 million. We terminated these treasury rate locks on January 5, 2006 when we issued the dollar denominated long term debt. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of &euro;800 million. We terminated these swap agreements on January 27, 2006 when we issued the new euro denominated long term debt. We classified these treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges since they hedged against fluctuations in interest rates relating to the anticipated issuance of debt associated with the Spirits and Wine acquisition. For more information on the new dollar and euro denominated long term debt issued in connection with the Spirits and Wine acquisition, see Note 6, "Long Term Debt" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information regarding the treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps, including the accounting for, and the gains and losses with respect to, these locks and swaps, see Note 13, "Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our $5,034.9 million and $5,186.9 million total long term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $4,918.9 million and $5,249.3 million, respectively. The fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased $1,070.0 million to $83.5 million primarily due to the consolidation of Spirits and Wine acquired assets transferred to Fortune Brands as of January 27, 2006. This investment recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005 was $1,083.2 million. 38 Minority Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased $184.9 million to $559.7 million principally due to a contribution by V&S Group of $153.0 million to maintain a 10% interest in the Spirits and Wine business, as well as an adjustment of $47.8 million recorded as minority interest expense in the consolidated statement of income, representing an increase in the estimated fair value of convertible redeemable preferred stock held by V&S, partly offset by absence of FIN 46R accounting for Spirits and Wine acquisition assets not transferred to Fortune Brands until January 2006. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity at year end 2006 increased $1,082.4 million compared to year end 2005, principally due to higher net income ($830.1 million), the acquisition of Simonton for which 50% was paid in stock ($297.9 million), an increase in cumulative foreign translation adjustments ($162.4 million) and the impact of stock based compensation ($118.3 million), partly offset by dividends paid ($224.0 million) and the impact of the adoption of FAS 158 on postretirement plan accounting ($119.9 million). Guarantees and Commitments Third party guarantees of the debt of Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (Maxxium), our Spirits and Wine business international sales and distribution joint venture, totaled approximately $82 million. We are required to perform under these guarantees in the event that Maxxium fails to make contractual payments. On December 12, 2005, we renewed the guarantees of Maxxiums credit facilities. The renewal extended the expiration date of the committed portion of the credit facilities to December 15, 2010. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," we recorded a liability of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2006 to reflect the fair value of the guarantees to Maxxium. We also guaranteed various leases for ACCO World Corporation, the Office products segment divested in a spin off on August 16, 2005. We will continue to guarantee payment of certain real estate leases with lease payments totaling approximately $43 million through April 2013. Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of these guarantees on our financial statements in accordance with FIN 45. As of December 31, 2006, we recorded a liability of $1.5 million. Refer to Note 3, "Discontinued Operation," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the spin off of the Office products segment. In addition, as a part of the formation of the Future Brands LLC (Future Brands) joint venture with V&S Group, Jim Beam Brands Co. (JBBCo.) has guaranteed any financial obligations of Future Brands that may arise in the event of a Future Brands default in which it fails to fulfill its operating obligations and which results in a claim. These financial obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands conducts business. We cannot estimate the possible future obligations under the Future Brands agreement. At December 31, 2006, JBBCo. did not have any outstanding obligations as a result of this arrangement. 39  Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table and discussion represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2006. (In millions) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2006 Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Short term borrowings $ 787.6 $ 787.6 $ $ $ Long term debt 5,036.4 1.6 610.0 1,750.0 2,674.8 Capital lease obligations 0.2 0.1 0.1 Operating leases 222.2 59.3 88.4 48.3 26.2 Interest payments on long term debt 2,348.4 263.4 508.2 386.3 1,190.5 Purchase obligations(a) 1,098.6 507.5 249.9 145.9 195.3 (a)Purchase obligations include contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; advertising, selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures. In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2006. These include the guarantee of certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $82.5 million, of which $13.2 million expires in less than one year with the remaining $69.3 million due in four to five years; a Shareholder Loan Facility executed by BGSW and Maxxium amounting to $19.8 million, of which no amounts were outstanding and which expires in four to five years; Standby Letters of Credit of $67.3 million, of which $62.4 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $4.9 million due in one to three years; and Surety Bonds of $47.9 million of which $47.8 million were due in less than one year with the remaining $0.1 million due in one to three years. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. Derivative Financial Instruments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (FAS 133), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and its related amendment Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 (FAS 138), "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Derivative gains or losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2006, $1.9 million in deferred currency gains were reclassified to cost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2005, $7.2 million in deferred currency losses were reclassified to cost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2004, deferred currency losses of less than $0.1 million were reclassified to cost of sales. We estimate that $4.2 million of currency derivative losses included in OCI as of December 31, 2006 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. 40 We paid the purchase price for the Spirits and Wine acquisition in British pounds sterling. In connection with the acquisition, in 2005 we entered into call options to buy British pounds sterling to hedge the currency exposure related to the purchase price. We terminated the call options in early July 2005. We also entered into forward contracts to buy British pounds to hedge the currency exposure related to the purchase price. We settled the forward contracts upon consummation of the acquisition in July 2005. In connection with the acquisition, we also entered into treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with fluctuation in interest rates related to anticipated issuance of new long term debt to finance the acquisition. We terminated these locks and swaps upon issuance of new long term debt in January 2006. See Note 13, "Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Currency Risk Certain forecasted transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, Euro, British pound sterling and Australian dollar. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of our new euro denominated debt. We have designated the euro denominated debt as net investment hedges with respect to the Spirits and Wine Acquired Assets which have euro denominated operations. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Interest Rate Risk We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. We also may, from time to time, enter into treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with fluctuation in interest rates related to anticipated issuances of new long term debt. See Note 13, "Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statement, Item 8 to this Form 10 K, for more information about the management of our interest rate risk. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In July, 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is recognition, where we will determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is measurement, where we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize in our financial statements. FIN 48 requires that, upon adoption, we record any change in net assets that results from the application of FIN 48 as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. This will result in an adjustment to net assets and retained earnings of $0 20 million. FIN 48 is effective January 1, 2007. 41 Fair Value Measurement In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. This Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (calendar 2008 for Fortune Brands). We are evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our results of operations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the following are the Companys critical accounting policies due to the more significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our assumptions and estimates, which are based on historical experience. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. Trade receivables do not include interest. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations, usually due to customers potential insolvency or early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns for continuing operations was $49.1 million and $52.4 million as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Inventories The first in, first out inventory method is our principal inventory method. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice, maturing spirits and wine inventories are classified as current assets, although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one year due to the duration of aging processes. Inventory reserves are recorded for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory turns and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes. 42 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided, principally on a straight line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses resulting from dispositions are included in income. Betterments and renewals, which improve and extend the life of an asset, are capitalized; maintenance and repair costs are expensed. Estimated useful lives of the related assets are as follows: Buildings and leasehold improvements 15 to 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Long lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets," a long lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangibles) or asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate at the time of future cash flow derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated using a quoted market price, or if unavailable, using discounted expected future cash flows. The discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on our weighted average cost of capital, which represents the blended after tax costs of debt and equity. Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangibles In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and under certain circumstances, and written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is required if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. We use a rate corresponding to our cost of capital, risk adjusted where appropriate, in determining discounted cash flows. Estimated cash flows are then determined by disaggregating our business segments to a reporting level for which meaningful identifiable cash flows can be determined. When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangibles) and related goodwill, we perform an impairment test to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. 43 FAS 142 requires that purchased intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impact on that intangible. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, pricing, competition, technology) and internal factors (e.g., product costs, margins, support expenses, capital investment) and their potential impact on cash flows for each business in both the near and long term, as well as their impact on any identifiable intangible asset associated with the business in developing and executing our short term and long term plans. Based on recent business results, consideration of significant external and internal factors, and the resulting business projections, indefinite lived intangible assets associated with that segment are reviewed to determine whether they are likely to remain indefinite lived, or whether a finite life is more appropriate. In addition, based on events in the period and future expectations, management considers whether the potential for impairment exists as required by FAS 142. Our predominant method of approximating fair value in determining whether an impairment exists is to use cash flow projections. We measure impairment based on discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the tradename compared to the carrying value of that tradename. When separate cash flow information is not available, we use the relief from royalty approach. Fair value is represented by the present value of hypothetical royalty income over the remaining useful life. Where information is not available to determine an appropriate royalty rate, we utilize a profit split methodology, which is a customary valuation practice, to establish a reasonable royalty rate. Profit split analyses allocate economic income (EBITDA less returns on working capital and fixed assets employed) between a tradename and residual assets of the economic unit to determine the expected profit margin associated with commercialization of the tradename. Additionally, independent valuation experts are used for periodic review and testing of managements assumptions relative to all significant trade valuations and lives, and for independent research on market and competitive dynamics. In conjunction with our ongoing review of the carrying value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, there were no write downs of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets. Warranty Reserves We offer our customers various warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold. We determine warranty expense in accordance with the policy established at each operating company. The main consideration is historic claim experience, which is company specific based upon the nature of the product category. We generally record warranty expense in cost of products sold at the time of sale. Refer to Note 15, "Product Warranties," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Warranty expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $41.3 million, $33.7 million and $33.9 million, respectively. 44 Employee Benefit Plans We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement, post employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on our historical experience, the nature of the plans investments and our expectations for long term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a spot rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The bond portfolio used for the selection of the interest rates is from the top quartile of bonds rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and includes only non callable bonds and those that are deemed to be sufficiently marketable. The discount rate as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 5.9% and 5.7%, respectively. The weighted average remaining service period for the pension plans at December 31, 2006 was 12.2 years. As required by United States generally accepted accounting principles, the effects of our modifications are generally accumulated and, if over a specified corridor, amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the related employees. The total net actuarial losses for all pension and postretirement benefit plans were $263 million at December 31, 2006, a reduction of $65 million from December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of the increase in the discount rate, loss recognition in pension expense ($19 million) and asset gains in excess of the expected rate of return. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the Companys plans are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our independent actuaries; however, difference in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For postretirement benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on historical cost increases and expectations for long term increases. As a result, our assumption as of December 31, 2005 was an assumed rate of increase of 9.5% in the next year, declining 50 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5%. As of December 31, 2006, to better reflect the differing market experience of medical and prescription drug claims, we bifurcated the rates: for postretirement medical, our assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 8.25% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year and, for postretirement prescription drugs, an assumed rate of increase of 11.25% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. Pension expenses were $43.3 million, $39.0 million and $37.4 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Postretirement expenses were $16.8 million, $14.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In 2007, we expect pension expense of approximately $41 million and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $14 million. A 25 basis point change (0.25%) in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension expense and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $3.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for 2007. A 25 basis point change in the long term rate of return used in accounting for the Companys pension plans would have a $1.5 million impact on pension expense. 45 Income Taxes In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We do not provide for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to permanently reinvest. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested were, in aggregate, $554.3 million at December 31, 2006. Revenue Recognition In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," we recognize revenue as products are shipped to customers, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. Criteria for recognition of revenue are when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We also provide for our estimate of potential bad debt at the time of revenue recognition. Amounts billed for shipping and handling are classified in "net sales" in the consolidated income statement. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are classified in "advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses." Shipping and handling costs included in "advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses" were $257.3 million, $219.4 million and $185.3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Customer Program Costs Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in many of our businesses. These businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sell through of that business products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume allowances, are accounted for as reductions to gross sales. These costs are recorded at the time of sale based on managements best estimates. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals, when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). Stock based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" (FAS 123R). FAS 123R requires share based compensation expense, measured as the fair value of an award on the date of grant, to be recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. FAS 123R is supplemented by Securities and 46 Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, "Share Based Payment." We adopted FAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, using the "modified prospective" transition method as defined in FAS 123R, which requires compensation cost to be recorded for all unvested stock options over the remaining service period beginning January 1, 2006. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of the following assumptions: an expected dividend yield; expected volatility; risk free interest rate; and expected term. The fair value of the September 2006 option grant was $13.89 per share. A change in the exercise price of $5 per share would have increased the fair value by $0.85 per share, or 6%; a change in the expected volatility of 100 basis points would have increased the fair value by $0.49 per share, or 4%. Prior to 2006, we applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for the stock option portion of stock based compensation. Because we granted stock options to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant, no compensation cost was recognized for options granted in periods prior to 2006. Cost Initiatives We continuously evaluate the productivity of our supply chains and existing asset base, and actively seek to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure. Future opportunities may involve, among other things, the reorganization of operations, the relocation of manufacturing or assembly to locations generally having lower costs and the efficient sourcing of products or components from third party suppliers. Implementing any significant cost reduction and efficiency opportunities could result in charges. Pending Litigation See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. Environmental Matters We are involved in numerous remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. As of February 1, 2007, various of our subsidiaries had been designated as potentially responsible parties ("PRP") under "Superfund" or similar state laws in 44 instances. Of these instances, 27 have been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In calendar year 2006, we were identified as a PRP in one new instance, one previously resolved matter was reopened and one PRP claim was dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. The average settlement amount was approximately $6,600. In most instances where we are named as a PRP, we enter into cost sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely if ever receive reimbursement from insurance. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other responsible parties or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had accruals of $33.1 million and $41.5 million, respectively, to cover environmental compliance and clean up including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites. The decrease primarily relates to expiration of a contractual indemnification period of a divested business. 47 Related Party Transactions Future Brands LLC The Spirits and Wine business is a partner with V&S Group (V&S) in a joint venture named Future Brands LLC (Future Brands), which distributes both companies spirits brands in the United States and provides related selling and invoicing services. Future Brands receives a commission from the partners for services provided. The Spirits and Wine business records revenue at the time of shipment to Future Brands customers. As part of forming this joint venture, JBBCo. has, in the event of default of Future Brands, a continuing obligation to satisfy any financial obligations of Future Brands that may arise in the event that Future Brands fails to fulfill its operating obligations and that results in a claim. These financial obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands has contracts. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, JBBCo. did not have any outstanding obligations as a result of this arrangement. The Spirits and Wine business balances related to Future Brands included the following: (In millions) 2006 2005 Accounts receivable (invoicing by Future Brands on behalf of JBBCo.) $ 115.1 $ 85.4 Investment 9.8 8.2 Accounts payable (commissions) and accrued liabilities 27.8 18.1 Deferred income 119.3 146.3 The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable was due to higher distribution through Future Brands due to sales resulting from the Spirits and Wine acquisition. Maxxium Worldwide B.V. BGSW is a partner in an international sales and distribution joint venture named Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (Maxxium), which distributes and sells spirits and wine in key markets outside the United States. The joint venture partners include R&eacute;my Cointreau, The Edrington Group and V&S. In November 2006, R&eacute;my Cointreau gave notice to Maxxium that it will terminate its distribution arrangement with Maxxium effective March 30, 2009. We do not expect that R&eacute;my Cointreaus eventual departure will have a material adverse impact on either the operations of Maxxium, or the financial results of the Company or the Spirits & Wine business. R&eacute;my Cointreau brands account for only about 15% of Maxxiums case volume. The Spirits and Wine business records sales at the time spirits are sold to third parties rather than at the time of shipment to Maxxium. As a result of forming this joint venture, the Company has guaranteed certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $82 million, of which $77 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2004, the guarantees totaled $85 million, of which $76 million was outstanding. BGSW has executed a Shareholder Loan Facility (Loan Facility) with Maxxium. There were no amounts outstanding under the Loan Facility as of either December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005. The Loan Facility was renewed in 2005 and expires December 12, 2010. 48 The Spirits and Wine business balances related to Maxxium included the following: (In millions) 2006 2005 Accounts receivable $ 79.3 $ 57.2 Investment 86.7 81.7 Accounts payable (expense reimbursement) and accrued liabilities 69.4 14.6 The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable was due to higher distribution through Maxxium due to international sales resulting from the Spirits and Wine acquisition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The counterparties are major financial institutions. Interest Rate Risk The disclosure about interest rate risk required to be provided under this item is set forth under "Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rates" and is incorporated herein by reference. A hypothetical 20 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Companys variable rate borrowings would not have a material effect on results of operations. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions. We periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. As indicated in the analysis that follows, the estimated potential loss under foreign exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value at risk (VAR) computation to estimate the potential economic loss that we could incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The VAR estimations are intended to measure the maximum amount of our loss from foreign exchange contracts due to adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates, given a specified confidence level, over a given period of time. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques. The estimated fair value loss shown in the table below does not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. Also, the use of the VAR model should not be construed as an endorsement of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions. 49 The following table summarizes our estimated loss under the VAR model as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (In millions) Estimated Amount of Loss Period Confidence Level 2006 foreign exchange $2.7 1 day 95% 2005 foreign exchange $1.4 1 day 95% The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange contracts would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of all outstanding contracts and the book value of the contracts were essentially the same. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. We use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility. The exposures under these contracts could be material to our financial statements. 50
