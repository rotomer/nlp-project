First, we enhance shareholder value by profitably building leading consumer brands to drive sales and earnings growth, as well as to enhance long term returns. We drive growth by positioning our brands and businesses to outperform their respective markets. We do this by developing innovative new products and effective marketing campaigns, expanding customer relationships, extending brands into adjacent categories and developing international growth opportunities. Second, we pursue business improvements by operating lean and flexible supply chains and business processes. Third, we promote organizational excellence by developing winning cultures and associates. Fourth, we seek to enhance returns by leveraging our breadth and balance and financial strength to drive shareholder value. While our first priority is internal growth, we also strive to achieve growth and high returns through acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. Finally, over time, we enhance shareholder value through other initiatives, such as using our financial resources to repurchase shares and pay attractive dividends. 24 Table of Contents In 2007, net income decreased 8% and diluted earnings per share decreased 10% to $762.6 million and $4.87, respectively, compared to 2006. Income from continuing operations decreased 8% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 10%. The decrease in profits was due primarily to the impact of the downturn in the U.S. housing products market, higher restructuring and restructuring related charges (incremental $0.30 per diluted share) and the absence in 2007 of tax credits recorded in 2006 ($86.5 million or $0.57 per diluted share). These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of new product sales, price increases (implemented to offset higher commodity costs in the Home & Hardware and the Spirits businesses), productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives, cost reduction efforts, lower Corporate expenses and the absence in 2007 of a 2006 minority interest charge related to an increase in the fair value of the Spirits business. The following summarizes the performance of each of our business segments in 2007: &gt; Our Spirits business achieved 4% growth in sales and 16% growth in operating income compared to 2006. Net sales increased primarily on worldwide volume growth in premium and super premium spirits, higher pricing and favorable foreign exchange. A significant portion of the increase in operating income was due to the gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets (The Dalmore), as well as higher sales and cost containment. Excluding the gain on the sale of The Dalmore, operating income increased 9%. &gt; Sales of our Home and Hardware business declined 3%, primarily as a result of the downturn in the U.S. home products market, partly offset by the addition of Simonton, successful line extensions and new product introductions, and expanded customer relationships in cabinetry and residential entry doors. Even with the challenging market conditions, our home products brands continued to gain share in cabinetry, faucets, entry doors and security products. Operating income was down 28% as a result of lower underlying sales and related unfavorable coverage of manufacturing and overhead costs, as well as higher restructuring and restructuring related costs related to supply chain initiatives. These decreases were partly offset by higher pricing, productivity improvements and aggressive cost management. &gt; Our Golf brands achieved a 7% increase in sales compared to 2006 on the strength of sales growth in all product categories, successful new products in golf clubs and golf shoes, strong growth in international markets, continued share gains in key product categories, a favorable shift in golf ball demand to premium models and favorable foreign exchange. Operating income was essentially the same as the prior year on higher sales, offset by increased brand support expenses, higher oil based commodity costs, and patent litigation and related costs. In December 2007, we sold our remaining U.S. wine assets to Constellation Brands, Inc. for $884.5 million, subject to purchase price adjustments for cash and working capital levels, after selling two wine brands and related assets to E. & J. Gallo Winery in August 2007. The sale to Constellation Brands, Inc. resulted in a net after tax gain on the sale of $5.2 million. In addition, in December 2007, we sold the U.S. distribution rights and related assets for The Dalmore for $58.0 million, resulting in a gain on the sale of $28.5 million, net of tax. In January 2006, we substantially completed the final legal transfer of the spirits and wine assets we acquired in July 2005. As a result of this acquisition, in January 2006 we refinanced a portion of the short term debt utilized for the acquisition and issued both dollar and euro denominated long term debt in the amount of $2 billion and 800 million (approximately $1 billion). Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Disposals and Note 8, Long Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In June 2006, we acquired SBR, Inc. (now Simonton Holdings, Inc.), a privately held company, which owns a leading vinyl framed window brand in North America. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Disposals, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 Table of Contents In 2008, we believe the Company will benefit from the following trends in our businesses: &gt; continued growth of premium spirits worldwide, &gt; sustained development of innovative and new products across all of our segments, &gt; international growth opportunities in all of our segments, &gt; expanding customer relationships, particularly in Home and Hardware, and &gt; aging population trends in the U.S. that favorably impact conditions in the home products and golf industries. The Company has also identified the following risks and challenges that may impact our businesses: &gt; adverse impact of the downturn in the overall U.S. home products market, which most economists project will decline at a low double digit rate in 2008, &gt; potential continuing increases in commodities costs, particularly copper, zinc and petroleum, and &gt; impact of external conditions (weather, destination travel and corporate spending) on overall demand for golf products. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2007 Compared to 2006 Fortune Brands net sales were slightly higher in 2007. Operating income was 5% lower and net income decreased 8%, primarily due to the impact of the downturn in the U.S. home products markets, higher restructuring and restructuring related charges, and the absence of 2006 tax credits. Net Sales Net sales were up $42.1 million, or 0.5%, benefiting from: &gt; newly introduced products and line extensions across all businesses (approximately $510 million in total, net of discontinued products), &gt; the impact of the Simonton acquisition ($182 million), &gt; strong international growth, &gt; favorable foreign exchange ($135 million), and &gt; targeted price increases (implemented to offset higher commodity costs in the Home and Hardware business, and for certain premium spirits brands). Net sales were negatively impacted by the downturn in the U.S. home products market. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $87.8 million, or 2%, primarily on the acquisition of Simonton ($127 million) and increased commodity costs, partly offset by the benefits of productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and facility consolidation/downsizing in the Home and Hardware business. Excise taxes on spirits Excise taxes on spirits were essentially the same as the prior year as a percentage of sales. Excise taxes are generally levied based on the alcohol content of spirits products. Consistent with industry practice, excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in net sales and the corresponding payments to governments in expenses. 26 Table of Contents Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $9.2 million, or 0.5%, primarily as a result of higher brand investment in the Spirits business to support our global premium brands and in the Golf business to support new product introductions, as well as due to the impact of the Simonton acquisition. Increases were partly offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, particularly in the Home and Hardware business, and lower Corporate expenses (reflecting a projected reduction in incentive compensation program payouts). Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles increased $4.7 million to $47.6 million, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the June 2006 Simonton acquisition. Restructuring charges For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $73.5 million. These charges were predominantly related to supply chain initiatives in the Home and Hardware business (including tangible and intangible asset impairment charges resulting from the consolidation of facilities in cabinetry, window and tool storage, closure of a cabinetry component operation, and the planned exits from the entry door market in the United Kingdom and decorative column product lines in the U.S.). In the Home and Hardware business, we closed or downsized several facilities to optimize supply chains and better align our cost structures and capacity to navigate the current downturn in the U.S. housing product market and to support long term growth. The 2007 charges consisted primarily of $16.3 million for workforce reduction costs, $49.6 million for asset write downs, and $7.6 million for contract termination and other related costs. For additional information on the Home and Hardware restructuring, refer to Results of Operations by Segment Home and Hardware 2007 compared to 2006. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $21.2 million, primarily related to supply chain initiatives in the Home and Hardware business. Gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights In 2007, we recorded pretax gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets of $45.6 million. Operating income Operating income decreased $71.6 million, or 5%, to $1,376.3 million, primarily due to lower sales in the Home and Hardware business and resulting unfavorable coverage of manufacturing and overhead costs, greater brand investment and higher restructuring and restructuring related charges. Operating income benefited from new product sales, price increases (implemented to offset higher commodity costs in the Home and Hardware business and in the Spirits business), a mix shift to premium products (in the Golf and Spirits businesses), a gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets ($45.6 million), productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives, cost reduction efforts, lower Corporate expenses and favorable foreign exchange. Interest expense Interest expense decreased $15.2 million, or 5%, to $293.6 million due to lower average debt, partly offset by an increase in commercial paper rates. Other income, net Other income, net decreased $2.7 million to $37.5 million. Other income, net, includes non operating income and expense, such as amortization of deferred income related to Future Brands LLC (our 27 Table of Contents Spirits businesss U.S. sales and distribution joint venture), interest income and foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Income taxes The effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 30.9% and 25.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective rate primarily resulted from the absence of 2006 tax credits of $85.9 million primarily associated with the favorable resolution of routine federal and state tax audits and changes in foreign tax laws that lowered income tax rates as they apply to foreign deferred income taxes. In addition, the 2007 effective tax rate was impacted by higher foreign income generally taxed at lower statutory rates and changes in foreign tax laws that lowered income tax rates as they apply to foreign deferred taxes. Minority interests Minority interest expense decreased $43.5 million to $24.4 million, primarily due to an adjustment of minority interest expense of $47.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2006 representing an increase in the estimated fair value of V&S Groups aggregate 10% ownership in the convertible redeemable preferred stock of the Spirits business. The estimated fair value of V&S Groups minority interest in BGSW did not change in 2007. Refer to Note 5, Minority Interest Held by V&S Group, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. Net income Net income was $762.6 million, or $4.98 per basic share and $4.87 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. This compared to net income of $830.1 million, or $5.56 per basic share and $5.42 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Income from continuing operations (excluding the U.S. Wine business) was $749.5 million, or $4.89 per basic share and $4.79 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations in 2006 of $812.1 million, or $5.44 per basic share and $5.31 per diluted share. The 8% ($62.6 million) decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to lower operating income and the absence in 2007 of tax credits recorded in 2006 ($86.5 million), partially offset by lower minority interest expense related to the Spirits business ($47.8 million). Income from discontinued operations declined $4.9 million, or 27%, primarily due to lower U.S. wine sales and higher operating expenses. 2006 Compared to 2005 Fortune Brands achieved a 24% increase in net sales and a 26% increase in operating income. Income from continuing operations was up 41% and net income was up 34%. Net income benefited from: &gt; the full year benefit of the 2005 Spirits Acquisition (acquired July 2005), &gt; underlying growth in the Home and Hardware, Spirits, and Golf businesses, &gt; successful new products and line extensions, expanding customer relationships and extending brands into new markets, &gt; brand investments and share gain initiatives, &gt; price increases, including those implemented to help offset energy and raw material cost increases, &gt; the absence of currency hedge accounting expense incurred related to the 2005 Spirits Acquisition purchase price, and &gt; higher tax credits in 2006. 28 Table of Contents These benefits were partially offset by the impact of recording stock option compensation cost due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), higher restructuring and restructuring related costs in 2006 compared to 2005, and the absence of income due to the spin off of the Office products business. Net Sales Net sales increased $1.6 billion, or 24%, to $8.5 billion. Sales benefited from: &gt; newly introduced products and line extensions across all businesses, &gt; the net impact of the Simonton acquisition and 2005 Spirits Acquisition ($1.1 billion in aggregate), &gt; select price increases, across all of our businesses, but particularly in Home and Hardware, including those to help offset energy and raw material cost increases, &gt; expanding customer relationships, particularly for the cabinetry and entry door brands, &gt; extending brands into new markets, and &gt; favorable foreign exchange ($42 million). The increase in net sales was tempered by the impact of the downturn in the U.S. housing market, particularly in the second half of 2006. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $745.8 million, or 20%, primarily as a result of the Spirits and Simonton acquisitions, higher net sales, productivity improvements, and increased year over year costs for energy and raw materials (approximately $45 million), partially offset by price increases and productivity improvements. Excise taxes on spirits U.S. excise taxes on spirits increased as a percentage of sales by approximately 120 basis points due to a higher percentage of Spirits sales in Fortune Brands total revenues as a result of the 2005 Spirits Acquisition. In the U.S., excise taxes are levied based on the proof content of spirits products. Consistent with industry practice, U.S. excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in sales and the corresponding payments to governments in cost of sales. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $371.1 million, or 22%, primarily as a result of the 2005 Spirits Acquisition. In addition, increases were due to higher sales, increased advertising for new product introductions, and higher brand investment expenses in all business segments, as well as stock option compensation cost. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of intangibles increased $10.0 million to $42.9 million primarily due to amortization of finite lived intangible assets associated with the 2005 Spirits Acquisition ($4.9 million), as well as amortization associated with the Simonton acquisition ($4.6 million). Restructuring charges For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $21.2 million. These charges principally related to consolidation of manufacturing facilities and workforce reductions in the Home & Hardware and Spirits businesses. For the twelve months ended 29 Table of Contents December 31, 2005, we did not record any restructuring charges. Restructuring projects provide a return in excess of our cost of capital with an expected payback of less than three years. Operating Income Operating income in 2006 increased $296.6 million, or 26%, compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, as well as underlying growth in all businesses, partly offset by higher restructuring and restructuring related costs (incremental $15.7 million) and stock option compensation cost as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R ($25.1 million). Interest expense Interest expense increased $155.2 million, or 101%, to $308.8 million, primarily as a result of debt associated with the Spirits and Simonton acquisitions, as well as higher interest rates. Other (income) expense, net Other (income) expense, net increased $118.6 million to $40.2 million of income. The increase was primarily due to the absence of 2005s unfavorable impact of currency hedge accounting expense related to the 2005 Spirits Acquisition purchase price ($120.9 million). Income taxes Income taxes decreased $22.5 million, or 7%, to $299.3 million. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was 25.4% and 35.0%, respectively. The lower effective rate primarily related to higher tax credits in 2006 associated with reductions of foreign income tax rates applied to foreign deferred income taxes, as well as favorable resolution of routine federal and state tax audits. Minority interests Minority interest expense increased $47.9 million to $67.9 million, primarily due to an adjustment of minority interest expense of $47.8 million representing an increase in the estimated fair value of V&S Groups aggregate 10% ownership in the convertible redeemable preferred stock of the Spirits business. Refer to Note 5, Minority Interest Held by V&S Group, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. Net income Net income was $830.1 million, or $5.56 per basic share and $5.42 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to net income of $621.1 million, or $4.26 per basic share and $4.13 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005. Income from continuing operations was $812.1 million, or $5.44 per basic share and $5.31 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2006. These results compared to income from continuing operations of $577.5 million, or $3.96 per basic share and $3.84 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in income from continuing operations of $234.6 million, or 41%, was primarily due to higher operating income as well as substantial tax credits recorded in 2006 ($86.5 million in 2006 compared to $7.7 million in 2005, or an increase of $0.52 per diluted share). These benefits were partly offset by higher restructuring and restructuring related costs (incremental $15.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share), stock option compensation cost ($25.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share), and the absence of income due to the spin off of the Office products business ($0.26 per diluted share for discontinued operations in 2005). Income from discontinued operations decreased to $18.0 million in 2006 from $43.6 million in 2005 primarily because 2005 included income from the Office business that was spun off in 2005. 30 Table of Contents QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA Fortune Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries Unaudited (In millions, except per share amounts) 2007 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,909.1 $ 2,293.3 $ 2,145.3 $ 2,215.4 Gross profit 750.3 958.6 890.3 888.4 Operating income 256.3 415.8 368.0 336.2 Income from continuing operations 121.3 229.5 208.0 190.7 (Loss) income from discontinued operations (1.1 ) 2.5 0.9 10.8 Net income 120.2 232.0 208.9 201.5 Earnings per common share Basic Income from continuing operations $ 0.80 $ 1.50 $ 1.36 $ 1.24 Net income $ 0.79 $ 1.52 $ 1.36 $ 1.31 Diluted Income from continuing operations $ 0.78 $ 1.47 $ 1.33 $ 1.22 Net income $ 0.77 $ 1.48 $ 1.33 $ 1.28 2006 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,966.8 $ 2,198.6 $ 2,156.2 $ 2,199.4 Gross profit 792.2 946.2 883.7 916.5 Operating income 297.7 423.2 366.9 360.1 Income from continuing operations 172.1 245.0 147.2 247.8 Income from discontinued operations 1.3 2.8 4.1 9.8 Net income 173.4 247.8 151.3 257.6 Earnings per common share Basic Income from continuing operations $ 1.17 $ 1.66 $ 0.97 $ 1.63 Net income $ 1.18 $ 1.68 $ 1.00 $ 1.70 Diluted Income from continuing operations $ 1.14 $ 1.62 $ 0.95 $ 1.59 Net income $ 1.15 $ 1.63 $ 0.98 $ 1.65 31 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Spirits 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales increased $93.4 million, or 4%, to $2,606.8 million primarily due to a mix shift toward higher priced premium brands (particularly Sauza tequila, and Jim Beam and Makers Mark bourbons), favorable foreign exchange ($83 million), growth in international markets (especially Australia, global travel retail and emerging markets) and select price increases on premium spirits brands. These increases were partly offset by the negative impact of the wind down of a transitional bottling agreement with Pernod Ricard S.A. (Pernod Ricard) to produce certain products at cost subsequent to the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, as well as the adverse first quarter 2007 impact from the 2006 transition of distribution in Spain to our Maxxium Worldwide B.V. joint venture (no net impact on operating income), which decreased net sales by $44.2 million in aggregate. For more information on the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Disposals, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Operating income increased $106.1 million, or 16%, to $766.7 million primarily due to the increase in net sales, the gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets ($45.6 million), favorable foreign exchange, faster growth of higher margin premium and super premium brands, and cost synergies resulting from the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, partly offset by higher raw material costs. Global case volumes increased low single digits in 2007 compared to last year, primarily due to higher consumer demand for the Companys premium brands. The Company measures global case volumes based primarily on case shipments by the Companys distributors to retailers. The Spirits business is a partner in an international sales and distribution joint venture named Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (Maxxium) that distributes and sells spirits in select markets outside the United States, representing approximately one third of our international Spirits sales. The Company retains a 25% ownership interest in Maxxium and accounts for its investment using the equity method. The Companys other 25% partners in Maxxium are R&eacute;my Cointreau S.A. (R&eacute;my), The Edrington Group Ltd. and V&S Group (V&S). In November 2006, R&eacute;my gave notice to Maxxium that it will terminate its distribution agreement with Maxxium effective March 30, 2009. In connection with R&eacute;mys termination, it is expected that R&eacute;my will pay a substantial termination penalty to Maxxium. Based on the expected impact of R&eacute;mys termination of the distribution agreement on Maxxiums financial position and results of operations, the Company currently estimates that its investment in Maxxium of $96.3 million is recoverable. For additional information, refer to Note 6, Related Party Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The government of Sweden has commenced a process that is expected to result in the privatization of V&S. V&S is one of our joint venture partners in Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (international sales and distribution) and, through its U.S. subsidiary, is our joint venture partner in Future Brands LLC (U.S. sales and distribution). In addition, V&S owns a 10% interest in the convertible preferred stock of Beam Global Spirits and Wine, Inc., our Spirits business. At this time, we cannot predict what impact a change in the ownership of V&S would have on V&Ss participation in our sales and distribution joint ventures. We remain interested in acquiring V&S. Factors that could adversely affect results include potential changes to distribution, competitive pricing activities, changes in U.S. wholesale distributor inventory levels, and the possibility of excise and other tax increases, including internationally. 32 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales increased $1,041.6 million, or 71%, to $2,513.4 million principally due to incremental net sales from the 2005 Spirits Acquisition ($763 million), as well as year over year sales growth in the combined business and favorable foreign exchange ($22 million). Growth for brands including Jim Beam bourbon, Sauza tequila and Makers Mark bourbon, as well as super premium brands and several regional/national brands, contributed to the increase. Reported net sales in 2005 were impacted by accounting for the acquisition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Prior to the legal transfer of acquired brands and assets (refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Disposals to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K), we consolidated variable interest entities where we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Certain entities consolidated at December 31, 2006 were not consolidated as of December 31, 2005, and certain assets or liabilities consolidated as of December 31, 2005 are no longer owned by entities consolidated as of December 31, 2006. Operating income increased $272.2 million, or 70%, to $660.6 million on the benefit of higher sales, synergy benefits from the 2005 Spirits Acquisition and lower transition costs, partly offset by the inclusion of stock option compensation cost beginning in 2006. Operating income margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately $90 million recorded as revenues that generated no operating income, primarily related to short term cost only transitional bottling agreements with Pernod Ricard. In addition, operating income was affected by accounting under FIN 46R. Home and Hardware 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales decreased $143.3 million, or 3%, to $4,550.9 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the adverse impact of an estimated low double digit decline in the U.S. home products market. Sales benefited from the acquisition of Simonton ($182 million), new products and line extensions (approximately $428 million in total, particularly in faucets and related products, cabinetry and entry doors), share gains (including cabinetry, faucets, entry doors and security products), expansion with key customers, the impact of select commodity cost related price increases, and favorable foreign exchange. Operating income decreased $192.4 million, or 28%, to $503.0 million. Operating income was negatively impacted by lower underlying sales and the resulting unfavorable coverage of manufacturing and overhead costs, as well as higher restructuring and restructuring related costs related to supply chain initiatives (incremental $70 million). Price increases offset the effect of higher commodity costs (approximately $80 million, including the absence of commodity hedge gains in 2007). Operating income benefited from productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives, reduction in overhead and administrative costs, and facility closures/downsizing. In 2007, the Home and Hardware business recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $70.2 million and restructuring related charges of $26.1 million ($14.7 million recorded in cost of sales and $11.4 million recorded in advertising, selling, general and administrative costs). These charges were related to supply chain initiatives including the consolidation of facilities in cabinetry, window and tool storage production, closure of a cabinetry component operation, and planned exit from the entry door market in the United Kingdom and decorative column product lines in the U.S. We closed or downsized facilities to optimize supply chains and better align our cost structures and capacity to navigate the current downturn in the U.S. housing products market and to support long term growth. The 2007 Home and Hardware restructuring charges of $70.2 million consisted primarily of $13.5 million for workforce reduction costs, $49.5 million for tangible and intangible asset write downs, $7.2 million for 33 Table of Contents contract termination and other related costs. We expect to incur additional charges of approximately $10 15 million in 2008 related to the completion of Home and Hardware restructuring programs initiated in the fourth quarter of 2007. Restructuring related charges in 2007 of $26.1 million were comprised of cost of sales charges for inventory write downs, as well as advertising, selling, general and administrative charges for accounts receivable reserves for doubtful accounts, warranty reserves and retention costs related to the exit from the entry door market in the U.K. and the decorative column products line in the U.S. During 2008, we expect to record as incurred cash outlays of approximately $25 30 million related to the completion of these programs. During 2008 and 2009, we expect cash proceeds from the sale of assets related to the restructuring programs will be approximately $20 million. We anticipate these programs, which commenced in the second half of 2006, will generate annual cost savings of $20 to $30 million beginning in 2008, in addition to savings achieved in 2007 of approximately $10 million. In 2006, the Home and Hardware business recorded pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of $16.9 million and $9.4 million, respectively, also primarily related to supply chain initiatives. In June 2006, the Home and Hardware business acquired SBR, Inc., including Simonton Windows, a leading brand of vinyl framed windows. The downturn in the overall U.S. home products market, which is projected by most economists to decline low double digits again in 2008, will continue to negatively impact the results of operations for our Home and Hardware business. We will strive to mitigate the impact of the downturn on our net sales through market share gain initiatives, successful extension of brands into new markets, expanding existing customer relationships, and building on our substantial presence in the more stable replace and remodel segment of the U.S. home products market. Through previously announced restructuring activities and ongoing cost control initiatives, we will work to align supply chain and administrative costs with expected demand in order to mitigate the impact of the downturn on our operating income and operating margins. We anticipate that 2008 will benefit from lower restructuring and restructuring related charges. Our business may also continue to be affected by competitive pricing, as well as further increases in the costs of certain commodities. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales increased $540.8 million, or 13%, to $4,694.2 million. The increase was primarily attributable to continued growth and share gains for cabinetry, faucet and padlock brands, as well as the benefit of acquisitions ($344 million), primarily the Simonton acquisition. Sales also benefited from new products and line extensions ($43 million in total), expanding customer relationships with home centers and major builders, expansion into adjacent categories (e.g., bath accessories, patio doors, impact resistant windows and automotive towing accessories), growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange ($23 million). In addition, sales benefited from price increases implemented to help offset higher costs for raw materials and energy. The net sales increase was tempered by the impact of the downturn in the overall U.S. home products market, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating income increased $40.3 million, or 6%, to $695.4 million. Operating income benefited from sales growth, productivity improvements and reversal of a legal reserve (approximately $7 million), as well as absence of both expenses in 2006 related to a lower cost sourcing initiative in cabinets in 2005 and an unfavorable steel purchase price variance for LIFO inventory in the tool storage category in 2005 ($7.9 million). These benefits were partially offset by higher commodity and energy costs (net impact approximately $30 35 million), restructuring and restructuring related charges ($26.3 million) and the inclusion of stock option compensation cost beginning in 2006 upon the adoption of FAS 123R. 34 Table of Contents Golf 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales increased $92.0 million, or 7%, to $1,405.4 million. The net sales increase was largely due to new product introductions, strong international growth, continued share gains in key product categories, and a favorable shift in golf ball demand to premium models. Net sales also benefited from higher sales in all product categories (golf balls, golf clubs, shoes, gloves and accessories), as well as favorable foreign exchange ($28 million). Operating income decreased $0.5 million to $165.5 million primarily on expenses related to international market expansion and investments in research and development, as well as higher patent litigation and related costs. These decreases were nearly offset by higher sales, as well as growth of premium golf balls and clubs. We expect the golf industry to benefit from favorable long term demographic trends, including an aging U.S. population (rounds of play increase with retirement), and the increasing popularity of golf internationally. In the near term, participation levels are impacted by factors including weather, economic conditions, golf related travel and corporate spending. The future success of the Golf business will depend upon continued innovation, product quality and successful marketing across product categories, as well as continued market growth. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales increased $47.6 million, or 4%, to $1,313.4 million. Higher sales resulted from sales growth in all product categories, driven in part by successful new products in golf clubs and golf shoes, and continued growth in international markets (Europe and Asia). Operating income decreased $5.5 million, or 3%, to $166.0 million primarily due to higher commodity and energy costs and the inclusion of stock option compensation cost beginning this year. Corporate 2007 Compared to 2006 Corporate expenses, which include salaries, benefits and expenses related to corporate office employees, as well as public company expenses, decreased $15.2 million, or 21%, to $58.9 million. These expenses decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense mainly resulting from lower expected payouts for long term incentive compensation programs. 2006 Compared to 2005 Corporate expenses increased $10.4 million, or 16%, to $74.1 million primarily due to the required expensing of stock option compensation cost beginning in 2006 upon adoption of FAS 123R. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, service indebtedness and pay dividends, as well as finance acquisitions and share repurchases when deemed appropriate. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, commercial paper, borrowings under our credit agreements and long term notes. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our 35 Table of Contents subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. Our focus for the use of our free cash flow and proceeds from divestitures, after internal growth, had been the paydown of debt incurred as a result of the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, resulting in a reduction in total debt in 2007 of $1.5 billion. The sale of the U.S. Wine business significantly improved our financial flexibility. We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate strategic options to increase shareholder value. We cannot predict whether or when we may enter into an acquisition, disposition, joint venture or other strategic options, including a share repurchase program, nor what impact any such transaction could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. For a description of the 2005 Spirits Acquisition and the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition, refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Disposals, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $965.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $982.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in cash provided of $17.4 million was principally due to the timing of interest payments on debt issued in 2006 ($70 million), higher first quarter 2007 payments for 2006 customer programs (primarily volume related) and employee performance incentives accrued in 2006, increased pension contributions ($31 million) and lower net income. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by the absence of a build up in acquisition related spirits inventory in 2006. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $744.2 million, compared with net cash used by investing activities of $762.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in cash of $1,506.5 million was primarily due to net proceeds of $948.3 million from the sale of the U.S. Wine business, as well as the absence of 2006 acquisition spending for the 2005 Spirits Acquisition ($309.5 million) and the 2006 acquisition of Simonton ($271.4 million). We focus our capital spending on growth initiatives and becoming the lowest cost producers of the highest quality products. Capital spending in 2007 was $267.1 million, $1.1 million higher than 2006. We currently estimate 2008 net capital expenditures will be in the range of $175 to $225 million. We expect to generate these funds internally. Net cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,713.0 million, compared with $145.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase of $1,567.5 million was primarily due to the paydown of debt this year from cash flow from operating activities and the sale of the U.S. Wine business. These cash outflows were partly offset by the absence in 2007 of proceeds received in 2006 from V&S Group to maintain its 10% interest in the Spirits Business ($153.0 million). Capitalization Total debt decreased $1,450.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $4.4 billion primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of the U.S. Wine business ($948.3 million) and The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets ($58 million), as well as due to cash from operating activities. The ratio of total debt to total capital decreased to 41.2% at December 31, 2007 from 52.4% at December 31, 2006 primarily due to paydown of debt, 2007 net income and increased foreign translation adjustments in stockholders equity. We have two revolving credit agreements with various banks. These agreements include a $2.0 billion, 5 year revolving credit agreement, which matures in 2010, and a $500 million, 364 day 36 Table of Contents revolving credit agreement, under which there were no amounts outstanding. On October 4, 2007 we renewed our 364 day, $500 million revolving credit facility to mature in 2008. The agreement includes the option to extend payment for one year at the Companys discretion for an incremental fee of 0.125% of the outstanding amount. This facility replaces the previous 364 day facility. The interest rates, which are variable, are based on market interest rates at the time of the borrowing and the Companys long term credit rating. Facility fees of 0.08% per annum are subject to increases up to maximum fees of 0.15% per annum in the event our long term debt rating falls below specified levels. The facility supports the Companys commercial paper borrowings in the commercial paper market. In May 2006, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a new universal shelf registration statement, covering the offer and sale of an undetermined amount of various securities. Minority Interest Held by V&S Group The minority interest in our Spirits business (BGSW) is in the form of shares of redeemable and convertible preferred stock held by V&S Group (The BGSW Minority Interest). V&S may require the Company to purchase the BGSW Minority Interest at fair value in whole or in part upon one years notice, or at any time upon a change in control of BGSW, Jim Beam Brands Co., or certain other events. The Company has the right to acquire the BGSW Minority Interest at fair value in whole or in part upon a change in control of the Absolut Spirits Company, Incorporated, sale of the Absolut brand, or the dissolution of Future Brands LLC (our U.S. sales and distribution joint venture). The BGSW Minority Interest cannot be transferred or sold to a third party by V&S without the Companys consent. We account for the redemption feature in accordance with EITF Topic D 98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, and measure this minority interest at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in net income from continuing operations. BGSW is not a publicly traded entity and therefore there is no quoted market price for its common or preferred shares. At each reporting period, we estimate fair value based on a combination of market based earnings multiples and discounted cash flow techniques. The ultimate fair value upon redemption will be based upon numerous factors that will be subject to assessment by the BGSW board or by an independent appraiser if the board is unable to reach a consensus. The fair value of the minority interest recorded at December 31, 2007 was $542.9 million. Dividends In July 2007, we increased the dividend on common stock 8% to an annual rate of $1.68 per common share. A summary of 2007 dividend activity for the Companys common stock is shown below: Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date $0.39 per share January 25, 2007 February 7, 2007 March 1, 2007 $0.39 per share April 24, 2007 May 9, 2007 June 1, 2007 $0.42 per share July 31, 2007 August 15, 2007 September 4, 2007 $0.42 per share September 25, 2007 November 7, 2007 December 3, 2007 A summary of 2007 dividend activity for the Companys $2.67 Convertible Preferred stock is shown below: Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date $0.6675 per share January 25, 2007 February 7, 2007 March 10, 2007 $0.6675 per share April 24, 2007 May 9, 2007 June 10, 2007 $0.6675 per share July 31, 2007 August 15, 2007 September 10, 2007 $0.6675 per share September 25, 2007 November 7, 2007 December 10, 2007 37 Table of Contents Adequacy of Liquidity Sources We believe that our internally generated funds, together with access to global credit markets, are adequate to meet our long term and short term capital needs. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Item 1. Business Forward Looking Statements. Pension Plans On a periodic basis, we evaluate the assumptions used in determining our pension liabilities and assets as well as pension expense based on historical returns on plan assets and current economic conditions at the time the assumptions are set. Our December 2007 review of the economic assumptions, and our cash flow spot rate yield curve analysis, led to an increase in our weighted average discount rate from 5.9% to 6.4% and the weighted average expected rate of return increased from 8.2% to 8.3%. Management believes that these assumptions are appropriate. Our December 2006 review of the economic assumptions, and our cash flow spot rate yield curve analysis, led to an increase in our weighted average discount rate from 5.7% to 5.9% and the weighted average expected rate of return decreased from 8.3% to 8.2%. Total pension plan cash contributions were $48.9 million and $18.1 million, respectively, in 2007 and 2006. The Company maintains pension plans at many of its operations. The pension plans in aggregate are funded in excess of the Current Liability, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. In 2008, we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $30 to $50 million to fund existing pension liabilities for our defined benefit plans. We believe that our internally generated funds will be adequate to make these pension plan cash contributions. Foreign Exchange We have investments in various foreign countries, principally Australia, Canada, Mexico, Spain, the U.K. and France. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our balance sheet and cash flow statements when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, in 2006 we issued euro denominated long term debt. See Note 8, Long Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Interest Rates We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount. We record the payments or receipts under the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding during 2007. We also may, from time to time, enter into treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with fluctuation in interest rates related to anticipated issuance of new long term debt. In the second quarter of 2005, we entered into treasury rate locks with an aggregate notional value of $1.25 billion in order to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to the anticipated issuances of the dollar denominated debt associated with the 2005 Spirits Acquisition. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we entered into additional treasury rate locks with an aggregate notional value of $500 million. We terminated these treasury rate locks on January 5, 2006 when we issued the dollar denominated long term debt. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of 800 million. We terminated these 38 Table of Contents swap agreements on January 27, 2006 when we issued the new euro denominated long term debt. We classified these treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges since they hedged against fluctuations in interest rates relating to the anticipated issuance of debt associated with the 2005 Spirits Acquisition. For more information on the new dollar and euro denominated long term debt issued in connection with the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, see Note 8, Long Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. For more information regarding the treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps, including the accounting for, and the gains and losses with respect to, these locks and swaps, see Note 15, Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our $4,142.7 million and $5,036.6 million total long term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $4,005.6 million and $4,918.9 million, respectively. The fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. Guarantees and Commitments Third party guarantees of the debt of Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (Maxxium), our Spirits businesss international sales and distribution joint venture, totaled $91.2 million. We are required to perform under these guarantees in the event that Maxxium fails to make contractual payments. On December 12, 2005, we renewed the guarantees of Maxxiums credit facilities. The renewal extended the expiration date of the committed portion of the credit facilities to December 12, 2010. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, we recorded a liability of $0.4 million as of December 31, 2007 to reflect the fair value of the guarantees to Maxxium. In addition, as a part of the formation of the Future Brands LLC (Future Brands) joint venture with V&S Group in 2001, Jim Beam Brands Co. (JBBCo.) has guaranteed any financial obligations of Future Brands that may arise in the event of a Future Brands default in which it fails to fulfill its operating obligations and which results in a claim. These financial obligations include, but are not limited to, making payments to suppliers, employees and other parties with which Future Brands conducts business. We cannot estimate the possible future obligations under the Future Brands agreement. At December 31, 2007, JBBCo. did not have any outstanding obligations as a result of this arrangement. We also guaranteed various leases for ACCO World Corporation, the Office products segment divested on August 16, 2005. We will continue to guarantee payment of certain real estate leases with lease payments totaling approximately $36.1 million through April 2013. Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of these guarantees on our financial statements in accordance with FIN 45. As of December 31, 2007, we recorded a liability of $1.0 million. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information on the spin off of the Office products segment. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table and discussion represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2007. (In millions) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2007 Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Short term borrowings $ 231.0 $ 231.0 $ $ $ Long term debt 4,142.7 200.0 448.0 750.0 2,744.7 Operating leases 204.6 55.3 78.8 47.8 22.7 Interest payments on long term debt 1,952.8 206.6 385.4 312.1 1,048.7 Purchase obligations(a) 785.8 301.6 167.8 117.1 199.3 Pension contributions(b) 3.7 3.7 (a) Purchase obligations include contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; advertising, selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures. (b) Minimum required pension contributions cannot be determined beyond 2008. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, $411.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above. See Note 14, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2007. These include the guarantee of certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $77.3 million, of which $6.1 million expires in less than one year with the remaining $71.2 million due in two to three years; a Shareholder Loan Facility executed by BGSW and Maxxium amounting to $21.9 million, of which no amounts were outstanding and which expires in three to four years; Standby Letters of Credit of $94.8 million, of which $60.7 million expires in less than one year with the remaining $34.1 million expiring in one to three years; and Surety Bonds of $23.9 million of which $23.8 million expires in less than one year with the remaining $0.1 million expiring in one to three years. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. Derivative Financial Instruments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related amendment Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 (FAS 138), Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Derivative gains or losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2007, $15.4 million in 40 Table of Contents deferred currency losses were reclassified to cost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2006, $1.9 million in deferred currency gains were reclassified to cost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2005, deferred currency losses of $7.2 million were reclassified to cost of sales. We estimate that $3.4 million of currency derivative losses included in OCI as of December 31, 2007 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. Foreign Currency Risk Certain forecasted transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Euro, Mexican peso and British pound sterling. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of our new euro denominated debt. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Interest Rate Risk We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. We also may, from time to time, enter into treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with fluctuation in interest rates related to anticipated issuances of new long term debt. See Note 15, Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statement, Item 8 to this Form 10 K, for more information about the management of our interest rate risk. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Fair Value Measurement In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. This Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (calendar 2008 for Fortune Brands). We do not expect FAS 157 to materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Fair Value Option In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 is effective as of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007 (calendar 2008 for Fortune Brands). We will not make the election for any current financial assets or liabilities. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007) (FAS 141R), Business Combinations. FAS 141R replaces FAS No. 141, Business Combinations. FAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer, a) recognizes and measures the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired and c) determines what information to disclose. FAS 141R also requires that all acquisition related costs, including restructuring, be recognized separately from the acquisition. FAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period 41 Table of Contents beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (calendar 2009 for Fortune Brands). This Statement eliminates adjustments to goodwill for changes in deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the acquisition accounting measurement period (limited to one year from acquisition), including for acquisitions prior to adoption of FAS 141R. Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (FAS 160), Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. FAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest (currently referred to as minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement changes the consolidated balance sheet presentation of noncontrolling interests from the mezzanine level (between liabilities and stockholders equity) to a component of stockholders equity, however because the minority interest in the Spirits business held by V&S Group is in the form of redeemable preferred stock, it will continue to be classified in the mezzanine level (between liabilities and stockholders equity). As of December 31, 2007, the carrying value of the minority interest held by V&S Group was $542.9 million and the carrying value of other minority interests/noncontrolling interests (which will be reclassified to equity upon adoption of FAS 160) was $15.6 million. FAS 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary. FAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 (calendar 2009 for Fortune Brands). This statement applies prospectively except presentation and disclosure requirements are applied retrospectively for all periods presented. FAS 160 will have an impact on the presentation of noncontrolling interests on the Fortune Brands statements of income, financial position and stockholders equity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the following are the Companys critical accounting policies due to the more significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our assumptions and estimates. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers potential insolvency), or early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns for continuing operations was $53.8 million and $49.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 42 Table of Contents Inventories The first in, first out inventory method is our principal inventory method. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice, maturing spirits inventories are classified as current assets, although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one year due to the duration of aging processes. Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost of market value for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory turns and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes. Long lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, a long lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangibles) or asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated using a quoted market price, or if unavailable, using discounted expected future cash flows. In 2007, we recorded in restructuring expense non cash impairments of identifiable definite lived intangibles of $12.6 million, as well as property, plant and equipment of $37.0 million. Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangibles In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is required if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or under certain circumstances, a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business. When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangible assets) and related goodwill, we perform an impairment test to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. FAS 142 requires that purchased intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impact on that intangible. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Our 43 Table of Contents predominant method of approximating fair value in determining whether an impairment exists is to use cash flow projections. We measure impairment based on discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the tradename compared to the carrying value of that tradename. When separate cash flow information is not available, we use the relief from royalty approach. Fair value is represented by the present value of hypothetical royalty income over the remaining useful life. Where information is not available to determine an appropriate royalty rate, we utilize a profit split methodology, which is a customary valuation practice, to establish a reasonable royalty rate. Profit split analyses allocate economic income (EBITDA less returns on working capital and fixed assets employed) between a tradename and residual assets of the economic unit to determine the expected profit margin associated with commercialization of the tradename. There were no write downs of goodwill or indefinite lived identifiable intangible assets in 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, the impact of the economic environment, particularly related to our Home and Hardware companies; a material negative change in relationships with significant customers; or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions. Minority Interest Held by V&S Group V&S Group (V&S) owns a 10% minority interest in our Spirits business (BGSW). The minority interest is in the form of shares of redeemable and convertible preferred stock (The BGSW Minority Interest). The carrying value of the minority interest at December 31, 2007 was $542.9 million. V&S may require the Company to purchase the BGSW Minority Interest at fair value in whole or in part upon one years notice, or at any time upon a change in control of BGSW, Jim Beam Brands Co., or certain other events. The Company has the right to acquire the BGSW Minority Interest at fair value in whole or in part upon a change in control of the Absolut Spirits Company, Incorporated, sale of the Absolut brand, or the dissolution of Future Brands LLC (our U.S. sales and distribution joint venture). The BGSW Minority Interest cannot be transferred or sold to a third party by V&S without the Companys consent. We account for the redemption feature in accordance with EITF Topic D 98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, and measure this minority interest at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in income from continuing operations. BGSW is not a publicly traded entity and therefore there is no quoted market price for its common or preferred shares. At each reporting period, we estimate fair value based on a combination of market based earnings multiples and discounted cash flow techniques. The ultimate fair value upon redemption will be based upon numerous factors that will be subject to assessment by the BGSW board or by an independent appraiser if the board is unable to reach a consensus. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement, post employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on our historical experience, the nature of the plans investments and our expectations for long term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a spot rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to 44 Table of Contents the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The bond portfolio used for the selection of the interest rates is from the top quartile of bonds rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and includes only non callable bonds and those that are deemed to be sufficiently marketable with a Moodys credit rating of Aa or higher. The discount rate as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 6.4% and 5.9%, respectively. The weighted average remaining service period for the pension plans at December 31, 2007 was approximately 11.0 years. Compensation increases reflect expected future compensation trends. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the effects of our modifications are generally accumulated and, if over a specified corridor, amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the related employees. The total net actuarial losses for all pension and postretirement benefit plans were $177 million at December 31, 2007, a reduction of $86 million from December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of actuarial gains during 2007 ($70 million primarily due to the increase in the discount rate), as well as loss recognition in pension expense ($16 million). We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the Companys plans are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our independent actuaries; however, difference in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For postretirement benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on historical cost increases and expectations for long term increases. As of December 31, 2007, for postretirement medical, our assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 7.5% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year, and, for postretirement prescription drugs, an assumed rate of increase of 10.5% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. Our assumption as of December 31, 2006 for postretirement medical was an assumed rate of increase of 8.25% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year, and, for postretirement prescription drugs, an assumed rate of increase of 11.25% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. Pension expenses were $41.8 million, $43.3 million and $39.0 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Postretirement expenses were $9.3 million, $16.8 million and $14.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. A 25 basis point change in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension expense and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for 2008. A 25 basis point change in the long term rate of return used in accounting for the Companys pension plans would have a $2.1 million impact on pension expense. Income Taxes In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. We record liabilities for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is 45 Table of Contents a two step process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, zero tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded. The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the Companys estimates. In future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require the Company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling $411.4 million. It is reasonably possible the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $205 to $230 million in the next 12 months primarily as a result of the conclusion of U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings. Customer Program Costs Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in many of our businesses. These businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sell through of that businesss products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume allowances, are generally accounted for in either net sales or the category advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses at the time the program is initiated and or the revenue is recognized. The costs recognized in net sales include, but are not limited to, general customer program generated expenses, cooperative advertising programs, volume allowances and promotional allowances. The costs typically recognized in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses include point of sale materials. These costs are recorded at the time of sale based on managements best estimates. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals, when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). Cost Initiatives We continuously evaluate the productivity of our supply chains and existing asset base, and actively seek to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure. Future opportunities may involve, among other things, the reorganization of operations, the relocation of manufacturing or assembly to locations generally having lower costs and the efficient sourcing of products or components from third party suppliers. Implementing any significant cost reduction and efficiency opportunities could result in charges. Pending Litigation See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. Environmental Matters We are involved in numerous remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never 46 Table of Contents owned. As of February 1, 2008, various of our subsidiaries had been designated as potentially responsible parties (PRP) under Superfund or similar state laws in 48 instances. Of these instances, 27 have been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In calendar year 2007, we were identified as a PRP in four new instances. In most instances where we are named as a PRP, we enter into cost sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other responsible parties or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had accruals of $32.1 million and $33.1 million, respectively, to cover environmental compliance and clean up including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The counterparties are major financial institutions. Interest Rate Risk The disclosure about interest rate risk required to be provided under this item is set forth under Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rates and is incorporated herein by reference. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Companys variable rate borrowings would not have a material effect on results of operations. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions. We periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. As indicated in the analysis that follows, the estimated potential loss under foreign exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value at risk (VAR) computation to estimate the potential economic loss that we could incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The VAR estimations are intended to measure the maximum amount of our loss from foreign exchange contracts due to adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates, given a specified confidence level, over a given period of time. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques. Also, the use of the VAR model should not be construed as an endorsement of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions. 47 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our estimated loss under the VAR model as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (In millions) Estimated Amount of Loss Period Confidence Level 2007 foreign exchange $ 1.6 1 day 95% 2006 foreign exchange $ 2.7 1 day 95% The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange contracts would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. We use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility. The exposures under these contracts could be material to our financial statements. 48 Table of Contents
