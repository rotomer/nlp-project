(Fortune Brands) is a holding company with subsidiaries that make and sell leading consumer branded products worldwide in the following markets: distilled spirits, home and hardware, and golf products. We strive to enhance shareholder value in a variety of ways, including: &gt; profitably building leading consumer brands to drive sales and earnings growth and enhance returns on a long term basis, &gt; positioning our brands and businesses to outperform their respective markets. We do this by: &gt; developing innovative new products and effective marketing programs, &gt; expanding customer relationships, &gt; extending brands into adjacent categories and &gt; developing international growth opportunities, &gt; pursuing business improvements by operating lean and flexible supply chains and business processes, 25 Table of Contents &gt; promoting organizational excellence by developing winning cultures and associates, and &gt; leveraging our breadth and balance and financial resources to drive shareholder value. While our first priority is internal growth, we also strive to create shareholder value through add on acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. In addition, over time, we enhance shareholder value through other initiatives, such as using our financial resources to pay down debt, repurchase shares and pay dividends. For a description of certain factors that may have had, or may in the future have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, see Forward Looking Statements. In 2008, net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 59% to $311.1 million and $2.02, respectively, compared to 2007. Income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 79%. The decrease in profits was primarily due to: &gt; asset impairment charges ($659.4 million after tax), &gt; the impact of the downturn in the U.S. housing products market and the global economic environment, &gt; write downs of the Spirits businesss investment in Maxxium ($50.5 million), and &gt; the absence of 2007s gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky (The Dalmore) U.S. distribution rights and related assets ($28.5 million after tax). Income from continuing operations benefited from: &gt; income due to the termination of the Spirits U.S. distribution agreement and the related deferred gain recognition ($190.9 million after tax in aggregate), &gt; tax related credits ($98.4 million), &gt; a gain due to the reduction in the fair value of the minority interest in the Spirits business ($81.9 million after tax), &gt; new product sales, &gt; price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs in the Home & Hardware business, as well as targeted price increases in the Spirits business, &gt; productivity improvements, &gt; aggressive cost management, including global sourcing initiatives, and &gt; lower interest expense. The following summarizes the performance of each of our business segments in 2008: &gt; Sales of our Spirits business declined 5% and operating income decreased 29% compared to 2007. Net sales decreased primarily on the impact of a new U.S. distribution program to facilitate lower and more consistent distributor inventory levels, the adverse impact of an unexpected Australian excise tax increase on ready to drink spirits products, the impact of the wind down of transitional manufacturing agreements with Pernod Ricard S.A. (Pernod Ricard) to produce certain products subsequent to a 2005 acquisition, and unfavorable foreign exchange. In addition, economic pressures resulted in lower net sales in certain markets. Sales benefited from a continued shift to the premium end of our portfolio, targeted price increases and the impact of the acquisition of Cruzan rum. Operating income was lower primarily due to the decline in sales, absence of 2007s gain on the sale of The Dalmores U.S. distribution rights and related assets, 26 Table of Contents restructuring and restructuring related charges in 2008 to reposition the business, including supply chain activities and route to market initiatives, as well as impairment charges on certain regional non U.S. tradenames. These factors were partially offset by a favorable mix shift toward our higher margin premium brands (outside of Australia). &gt; Sales of our Home and Hardware business declined 17%, primarily as a result of the downturn in the U.S. home products market which deteriorated as the year progressed due to the U.S. recession and credit crisis. Sales benefited from new products and line extensions as well as expansion into adjacent product categories. Operating income was down $968.6 million from 2007 as a result of asset impairment charges of $758.3 million, lower sales and related unfavorable coverage of manufacturing and overhead costs (adverse operating leverage), and higher commodity costs. These decreases were partly offset by productivity improvements, aggressive cost management, and lower restructuring and restructuring related costs related to supply chain initiatives. &gt; Sales of our Golf brands declined 3% compared to 2007 on lower sales in the U.S. as a result of the soft consumer demand for discretionary purchases and the impact of a reduction in inventory by retailers. Sales benefited from strong international growth, particularly in Asia, favorable foreign currency, and favorable sales mix. Operating income decreased 24% primarily due to brand investment to support our growth initiatives, lower sales and resulting adverse operating leverage, higher patent license expense and increased commodity costs. In 2008, we acquired the premium Cruzan rum business from Pernod Ricard S.A. (Pernod Ricard) for $103.2 million in cash. In addition, we repurchased the 10% minority interest in our Spirits business from Vin & Sprit Group (V&S) for $455.0 million. We also redeemed the 49% interest in our Spirits businesss U.S. distribution joint venture held by V&S. In a related transaction, we received $230.0 million from Pernod Ricard for early termination of the U.S. distribution agreement with V&S subsequent to its acquisition by Pernod Ricard. In December 2007, we sold our remaining U.S. wine assets to Constellation Brands for $887.0 million, after selling two wine brands and related assets to E. & J. Gallo Winery in August 2007. The sale to Constellation Brands resulted in a net after tax gain on the sale of $5.2 million in 2007. In addition, in December 2007, we sold the U.S. distribution rights and related assets for The Dalmore for $58.0 million, resulting in a gain on the sale of $28.5 million, net of tax. In June 2006, we acquired SBR, Inc. (now Simonton Holdings, Inc.), a privately held company, which owns a leading vinyl framed window brand in North America. In 2009, we expect to: &gt; remain focused on our initiatives designed to outperform our markets, &gt; aggressively focus on our supply chain and cost initiatives to partly offset the impact of adverse operating leverage, &gt; benefit from the strength of our brands and new products across all segments, and &gt; continue targeted brand building investment, innovation and expansion into new markets, including international growth opportunities in all of our segments. We have also identified the following risks and challenges that may impact our businesses: &gt; the broad based global recession and decrease in consumer discretionary spending, 27 Table of Contents &gt; continuing adverse impact of the downturn in the overall U.S. home products market on our Home and Hardware business, including its adverse impact on operating leverage of our fixed manufacturing costs, &gt; customers continuing to maintain lean inventories across all categories, and &gt; foreign exchange rates. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2008 Compared to 2007 Net Sales Net sales decreased $954.2 million, or 11%, to $7.6 billion primarily due to: &gt; the downturn in the U.S. home products market and its impact on our Home and Hardware business, &gt; weak consumer sentiment that reduced demand for discretionary purchases, including its adverse impact on our Home & Hardware and Golf businesses, and &gt; lower sales in certain markets in the Spirits business, including the impact of an Australian excise tax increase on ready to drink spirit products. Sales benefited from: &gt; newly introduced products and line extensions across all businesses (approximately $241 million in total, net of discontinued products), &gt; price increases implemented to offset higher costs for materials in the Home and Hardware business, as well as targeted price increases in the Spirits business, and &gt; growth in international markets in the Golf business. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold decreased $519.8 million, or 11%, primarily on lower sales, as well as cost reduction programs, global sourcing initiatives and productivity improvements. These factors were partly offset by adverse operating leverage, as well as higher commodity costs (approximately $85 90 million). Excise taxes on spirits Excise taxes on spirits were up 65 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year due to lower Home and Hardware sales and higher international spirits sales where we are the obligor as a percentage of spirits sales. Excise taxes are generally levied based on the alcohol content of spirits products. Consistent with industry practice, excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in net sales and the corresponding payments to governments are reflected in expenses. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $38.0 million, or 2%, primarily due to lower sales related variable costs and cost reductions in the Home and Hardware business, partly offset by the restructuring related organization repositioning, route to market initiatives and business repositioning costs in the Spirits business, as well as increased brand investment in the Golf business to support growth initiatives. 28 Table of Contents Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $2.0 million, or 4%, primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates. Asset impairment charges We recorded pre tax asset impairment charges in the Home & Hardware and Spirits businesses of $785.5 million ($659.4 million after tax). The Home and Hardware charges of $758.3 million included write downs of goodwill, tradenames and other long lived assets. While we are confident about the long term prospects for the Home and Hardware business, these charges were a result of the impact of a steeper than anticipated decline in the U.S. home products market and the general economy in the current year, as well as the expectation of a slower than previously anticipated recovery. For additional information, refer to the Results of Operations for the Home and Hardware segment. In addition, we recorded a $27.2 million write down of certain non U.S. regional Spirits tradenames. Restructuring charges In the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $81.8 million. Home and Hardware business charges ($49.5 million in total) primarily related to supply chain initiatives designed to align costs and capacities with marketplace conditions, including the announced closing of eight manufacturing facilities. Charges also included costs to exit from select low return product offerings ($10.5 million). In addition, we recorded charges in the Spirits business ($32.3 million) related to business repositioning, including supply chain activities and route to market initiatives in the U.S. and internationally. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $73.5 million (Home and Hardware $70.2 million, Spirits $2.7 million and Golf $0.6 million). Operating Income Operating income decreased $1,230.7 million to $145.6 million, primarily due to asset impairment charges of $785.8 million, lower sales in the Home & Hardware and Golf businesses and resulting adverse operating leverage, higher commodity costs, increased brand investment in the Golf business, and the absence of the 2007 gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets ($45.6 million). Operating income benefited from new products and line extensions, price increases (implemented to offset higher commodity costs in the Home and Hardware business and in the Spirits business), cost reduction programs, global sourcing initiatives, and productivity improvements. Interest expense Interest expense decreased $56.5 million, or 19%, primarily as a result of lower average debt, as well as lower average interest rates. Other income, net Other income, net, increased $242.4 million, predominantly due to $230.0 million of cash received from Pernod Ricard for the early termination of the Spirits U.S. distribution agreement, as well as $72.0 million due to recognition of remaining unamortized deferred income from the initial establishment of the joint venture. These amounts were partially offset by a $50.5 million write down of our investment in Maxxium. Other income, net, also includes non operating income and expense, such as interest income and transaction gains/losses related to foreign currency denominated transactions. 29 Table of Contents In 2009, results will be unfavorably impacted by the absence of the amortization of the deferred gain from V&Ss initial investment in the joint venture of $20.3 million in 2008 ($27.0 million on an annual basis), which will no longer be amortized in Other income, net. Income tax expense The effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 50.7% and 30.9%, respectively. The 2008 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the absence of a tax benefit on goodwill impairment charges of $451.3 million and a $50.5 million write down of our investment in the Maxxium joint venture, as well as income associated with termination of the Spirits businesss U.S. distribution agreement at the higher U.S. tax rate. The 2008 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a $98.4 million tax benefit related to final settlement of the federal income tax audit of our 2001 2002 federal tax returns. Additionally, the effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by tax credits associated with the conclusion of our 2004 2005 federal income tax audit, non goodwill impairment charges and higher restructuring charges in 2008 benefited at higher U.S. tax rates, and a higher portion of foreign income taxed at lower statutory rates. Minority interest (income) expense Minority interest income was $65.8 million in 2008 compared to expense of $24.4 million in 2007. The favorable change of $90.2 million was primarily due to an $87.9 million gain from a reduction in the fair value of the 10% minority interest in the Spirits business (BGSW) based upon the final settlement amount determined in connection with our repurchase of the minority interest in July 2008. As a result of redemption of the 10% minority interest in BGSW from V&S, effective July 25, 2008, future results will be favorably impacted by reduced minority interest expense as we will no longer pay a preferred dividend to V&S, which totaled $17.4 million after tax on an annual basis. This benefit will be partially offset by the interest expense on the debt incurred to finance the repurchase of the minority interest. Net income Net income was $311.1 million, or $2.05 per basic share and $2.02 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. This compared to net income of $762.6 million, or $4.98 per basic share and $4.87 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Income from continuing operations (excluding the U.S. Wine business that was sold in 2007) was $158.6 million, or $1.04 per basic share and $1.03 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. These results compared to $749.5 million, or $4.89 per basic share and $4.79 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, respectively. The $590.9 million decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to lower operating income (including asset impairment charges) and write downs of the Spirits businesss investment in Maxxium ($50.5 million). Income from continuing operations benefited from income due to the termination of the Spirits U.S. distribution agreement and the related deferred gain recognition ($190.9 million after tax in aggregate), as well as a gain due to a reduction in the fair value of the minority interest in the Spirits business ($81.9 million), lower interest expense and tax related credits ($98.4 million). Income from discontinued operations was $152.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, or $1.01 per basic share and $0.99 per diluted share. This included pre tax income of $4.0 million (after tax $2.5 million) from the settlement of outstanding working capital claims related to the sale of the U.S. Wine business. We also recorded a $43.1 million tax benefit related to finalization of the tax accounting for the sale of the U.S. Wine business and tax credits associated with the 30 Table of Contents conclusion of our 2004 2005 federal income tax audit that pertained to other discontinued operations. In addition, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completed its review of a tax refund associated with a capital loss carryforward item that was favorably resolved in an IRS administrative proceeding relating to our 2001 2002 federal tax returns. As a result, the final settlement of the audit of our 2001 2002 federal tax returns removed uncertainty relating to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward, and we recorded a $98.0 million tax benefit ($98.7 million unrecognized tax benefit less interest of $0.7 million) related to a capital loss carryforward position associated with the sale of the U.S. Wine business. This compared to income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 of $13.1 million, or $0.09 per basic share and $0.08 per diluted share. 2007 Compared to 2006 Fortune Brands net sales were slightly higher in 2007 compared to 2006. Operating income was 5% lower and net income decreased 8%, primarily due to the impact of the downturn in the U.S. home products markets, higher restructuring and restructuring related charges, and the absence of 2006 tax credits. Net Sales Net sales were up $42.1 million, or 0.5%, benefiting from: &gt; newly introduced products and line extensions across all businesses (approximately $510 million in total, net of discontinued products), &gt; the impact of the Simonton acquisition ($182 million), &gt; strong international growth, &gt; favorable foreign exchange ($135 million), and &gt; targeted price increases (implemented to offset higher commodity costs in the Home and Hardware business, and for certain premium spirits brands). Net sales were negatively impacted by the downturn in the U.S. home products market. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold increased $87.8 million, or 2%, primarily on the acquisition of Simonton ($127 million) and increased commodity costs, partly offset by the benefits of productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and facility consolidation/downsizing in the Home and Hardware business. Excise taxes on spirits Excise taxes on spirits were essentially the same as the prior year as a percentage of sales. Excise taxes are generally levied based on the alcohol content of spirits products. Consistent with industry practice, excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in net sales and the corresponding payments to governments in expenses. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $9.2 million, or 0.5%, primarily as a result of higher brand investment in the Spirits business to support our global premium brands and in the Golf business to support new product introductions, as well as due to the impact of the Simonton acquisition. Increases were partly offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, 31 Table of Contents particularly in the Home and Hardware business, and lower Corporate expenses (reflecting a projected reduction in incentive compensation program payouts). Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $4.7 million to $47.6 million, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the June 2006 Simonton acquisition. Restructuring charges For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $73.5 million. These charges were predominantly related to supply chain initiatives in the Home and Hardware business (including tangible and intangible asset impairment charges resulting from the consolidation of facilities in cabinetry, window and tool storage, closure of a cabinetry component operation, and the planned exits from the entry door market in the United Kingdom and decorative column product lines in the U.S.). In the Home and Hardware business, we closed or downsized several facilities to optimize supply chains and better align our cost structures and capacity to navigate the current downturn in the U.S. housing product market and to support long term growth. The 2007 charges consisted primarily of $16.3 million for workforce reduction costs, $49.6 million for asset write downs, and $7.6 million for contract termination and other related costs. For additional information on the Home and Hardware restructuring, refer to Results of Operations by Segment Home and Hardware 2007 compared to 2006. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $21.2 million, primarily related to supply chain initiatives in the Home and Hardware business. Gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights In 2007, we recorded pre tax gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets of $45.6 million. Operating income Operating income decreased $71.6 million, or 5%, to $1,376.3 million, primarily due to lower sales in the Home and Hardware business and adverse operating leverage, greater brand investment and higher restructuring and restructuring related charges. Operating income benefited from new product sales, price increases (implemented to offset higher commodity costs in the Home and Hardware business and in the Spirits business), a mix shift to premium products (in the Golf and Spirits businesses), a gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets ($45.6 million), productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives, cost reduction efforts, lower Corporate expenses and favorable foreign exchange. Interest expense Interest expense decreased $15.2 million, or 5%, to $293.6 million due to lower average debt, partly offset by an increase in commercial paper rates. Other income, net Other income, net, decreased $2.7 million to $37.5 million. Other income, net, includes non operating income and expense, such as amortization of deferred income related to Future Brands LLC (our Spirits businesss U.S. sales and distribution joint venture), interest income and foreign currency transaction gains or losses. 32 Table of Contents Income taxes The effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 30.9% and 25.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective rate primarily resulted from the absence of 2006 tax credits of $85.9 million primarily associated with the favorable resolution of routine federal and state tax audits and changes in foreign tax laws that lowered income tax rates as they apply to foreign deferred income taxes. In addition, the 2007 effective tax rate was impacted by higher foreign income generally taxed at lower statutory rates and changes in foreign tax laws that lowered income tax rates as they apply to foreign deferred taxes. Minority interest (income) expense Minority interest expense decreased $43.5 million to $24.4 million, primarily due to an adjustment of minority interest expense of $47.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2006 representing an increase in the estimated fair value of V&S Groups aggregate 10% ownership in the convertible redeemable preferred stock of the Spirits business. The estimated fair value of V&S Groups minority interest in BGSW did not change in 2007. Refer to Note 6, Minority Interest Held by V&S Group, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. Net income Net income was $762.6 million, or $4.98 per basic share and $4.87 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. This compared to net income of $830.1 million, or $5.56 per basic share and $5.42 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Income from continuing operations (excluding the U.S. Wine business) was $749.5 million, or $4.89 per basic share and $4.79 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations in 2006 of $812.1 million, or $5.44 per basic share and $5.31 per diluted share. The 8% ($62.6 million) decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to lower operating income and the absence in 2007 of tax credits recorded in 2006 ($86.5 million), partially offset by lower minority interest expense related to the Spirits business ($47.8 million). Income from discontinued operations declined $4.9 million, or 27%, primarily due to lower U.S. wine sales and higher operating expenses. 33 Table of Contents QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA Fortune Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries Unaudited (In millions, except per share amounts) 2008 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,806.1 $ 2,095.4 $ 1,921.8 $ 1,785.6 Gross profit 733.3 867.0 792.8 667.2 Operating income (loss) 227.2 (16.0 ) 254.8 (320.4 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 107.6 26.6 305.7 (281.3 ) Income from discontinued operations 12.9 109.4 30.2 Net income (loss) 120.5 136.0 335.9 (281.3 ) Earnings per common share Basic Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 0.70 $ 0.17 $ 2.04 $ (1.88 ) Net income (loss) $ 0.78 $ 0.89 $ 2.24 $ (1.88 ) Diluted Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 0.69 $ 0.17 $ 2.01 $ (1.88 ) Net income (loss) $ 0.77 $ 0.88 $ 2.21 $ (1.88 ) 2007 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Net sales $ 1,909.1 $ 2,293.3 $ 2,145.3 $ 2,215.4 Gross profit 750.3 958.6 890.3 888.4 Operating income 256.3 415.8 368.0 336.2 Income from continuing operations 121.3 229.5 208.0 190.7 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (1.1 ) 2.5 0.9 10.8 Net income 120.2 232.0 208.9 201.5 Earnings per common share Basic Income from continuing operations $ 0.80 $ 1.50 $ 1.36 $ 1.24 Net income $ 0.79 $ 1.52 $ 1.36 $ 1.31 Diluted Income from continuing operations $ 0.78 $ 1.47 $ 1.33 $ 1.22 Net income $ 0.77 $ 1.48 $ 1.33 $ 1.28 34 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Spirits 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales decreased $125.9 million, or 5%, to $2,480.9 million, primarily due to the decline in sales from the adverse impact of an unexpected Australian excise tax on ready to drink spirits products instituted in April (approximately $47 million), the impact of the wind down of transitional manufacturing agreements with Pernod Ricard S.A. (Pernod Ricard) to produce certain products subsequent to a 2005 acquisition (approximately $28 million), the impact of reduced fourth quarter 2008 sales due to a new U.S. distributor program that facilitates lower and more consistent U.S. distributor inventory levels going forward, and unfavorable foreign exchange ($25 million). In addition, economic pressures resulted in lower net sales in certain markets, particularly Spain, Germany and Mexico (approximately $32 million in aggregate). The sales of our portfolio of brands continued to shift toward the premium end, though at a slower rate. In addition, sales benefited from the impact of price and mix (approximately $35 million in aggregate) and the acquisition of Cruzan rum ($12.5 million). Operating income decreased $223.0 million, or 29%, to $543.7 million, primarily due to lower sales and $63.6 million in restructuring and restructuring related charges related to business repositioning, including supply chain activities and route to market initiatives, as well as absence of the 2007 gain on the sale of the Dalmore U.S. distribution rights and assets ($45.6 million) and a 2008 write down of certain non U.S. regional tradenames ($27.2 million). In addition, operating income was impacted by higher operating expenses (approximately $12 million), primarily due to increased information technology costs and U.S. distribution costs. BGSW is a partner in Maxxium, an international sales and distribution joint venture that we account for using the equity method. BGSW has a 25% ownership interest in Maxxium. The Companys other equal partners in Maxxium are R&eacute;my, The Edrington Group Ltd. (TEG) and V&S. In November 2006, R&eacute;my gave notice to Maxxium that it will terminate its distribution agreement with Maxxium effective March 30, 2009. In September 2008, BGSW entered into a Settlement Agreement (Settlement Agreement) with the Maxxium partners that resulted in the termination of V&Ss distribution agreement with Maxxium effective September 30, 2008 and will result in the exit of V&S and R&eacute;my as shareholders of Maxxium effective March 30, 2009. In the second quarter of 2008, we recorded a $25.1 million write down of our Maxxium investment (in Other income, net), primarily to reflect our share of a goodwill write down recorded in the financial statements of Maxxium that resulted from the impending departures of R&eacute;my and V&S. In the third quarter, as a result of the Settlement Agreement, we recorded an additional $25.4 million write down of our investment in Maxxium. The carrying value of the investment in Maxxium at December 31, 2008 was $54.3 million. On September 30, 2008, we closed on a transaction that resulted in the early termination, as of September 30, 2008, of the U.S. distribution agreement between BGSW and the U.S. business of V&S. Under the early termination agreement, Pernod Ricard paid Fortune Brands $230.0 million in cash in exchange for early termination of the distribution agreement, which was recorded in Other income, net, in the statement of income. In addition, we recognized the balance of unamortized deferred income of $72.0 million resulting from the initial payment from V&S in 2001 to establish the U.S. distribution joint venture. The early termination of the U.S. distribution agreement allows us to simplify our route to market in the U.S., exercise greater control over our distribution, and better align resources to sharpen focus on key market segments. The proceeds compensate us in advance for our higher costs of distribution over the remaining term of the joint venture agreement. As a part of the 35 Table of Contents early termination of the U.S. distribution agreement, BGSW redeemed the 49% interest in Future Brands held by V&S. Future Brands was consolidated as of September 30, 2008 and the consolidation did not have a material impact on the financial statements. V&S owned a 10% interest in our Spirits business. As a result of the government of Swedens sale of V&S, we exercised our call option to repurchase V&Ss 10% equity stake in the Spirits business and, in July 2008, we repurchased the minority interest for the carrying value of $455.0 million. In 2008 we recorded, in Minority interest (income) expense, an $87.9 million gain from a reduction in the fair value of the 10% minority interest in the Spirits business (BGSW) based upon the final settlement amount determined in connection with our repurchase of the minority interest. In the third quarter of 2008, we purchased the premium Cruzan rum business from Pernod Ricard for $103.2 million in cash. In September 2008, BGSW and TEG established an international distribution alliance that will be a combination of jointly owned and company owned sales forces in 24 Maxxium markets beginning April 1, 2009. The alliance provides that BGSW and TEG will have equal joint ownership of sales and distribution companies in certain markets and that BGSW controlled or TEG controlled distribution companies will distribute both companies products in certain other markets. As a result of the alliance, sales organizations that are 100% owned by us will distribute nearly half of our international sales, giving us significantly greater influence over our distribution in key markets. BGSW and TEG will work together to facilitate an orderly transition or winding down of Maxxium operations. In April 2008, the Australian government increased excise taxes on ready to drink products by 70%, equating to a 25% price increase to consumers, which adversely impacted demand for Beams pre mixed products including Jim Beam and Cola. Operating income will continue to be negatively affected by the excise tax increase until its impact is annualized at the end of April 2009. We expect to incur additional restructuring and restructuring related charges of approximately $20 million over the next 6 to 12 months related to our U.S. and international route to market strategic initiatives. In 2009, we expect operating income to be adversely affected by a net impact of approximately $30 35 million due to costs associated with our U.S. and international route to market initiatives. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2008 against major foreign currencies associated with our Spirits businesss international operations. If exchange rates as of December 31, 2008 remain in effect during 2009, our 2009 operating income may be negatively affected by approximately $35 to $45 million. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales increased $93.4 million, or 4%, to $2,606.8 million primarily due to a mix shift toward higher priced premium brands (particularly Sauza tequila, and Jim Beam and Makers Mark bourbons), favorable foreign exchange ($83 million), growth in international markets (especially Australia, global travel retail and emerging markets) and select price increases on premium spirits brands. These increases were partly offset by the negative impact of the wind down of a transitional bottling agreement with Pernod Ricard S.A. (Pernod Ricard) to produce certain products at cost subsequent to the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, as well as the adverse first quarter 2007 impact from the 2006 transition of distribution in Spain to our Maxxium Worldwide B.V. joint venture (no net impact on operating income), which decreased net sales by $44.2 million in aggregate. For more information on the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, refer to Note 5, Acquisitions and Disposals, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 36 Table of Contents Operating income increased $106.1 million, or 16%, to $766.7 million primarily due to the increase in net sales, the gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets ($45.6 million), favorable foreign exchange, faster growth of higher margin premium and super premium brands, and cost synergies resulting from the 2005 Spirits Acquisition, partly offset by higher raw material costs. Home and Hardware 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales decreased $791.8 million, or 17%, to $3,759.1 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the downturn in the U.S. home products market, which deteriorated as the year progressed due to the U.S. economic recession, the credit crisis, decreasing home prices and declining consumer confidence. The combination of these factors contributed to further reductions in new home construction and a shift to lower priced products, and also adversely impacted big ticket repair and remodeling, which historically has been more stable in housing downturns. Sales benefited from new products and line extensions (approximately $336 million in total, particularly in faucets and cabinetry), continued extension of brands into adjacent product categories, market share gains in key product categories (faucets and security products), and the impact of select price increases. Operating income decreased $968.6 million resulting in a loss of $465.6 million, primarily due to lower sales and resulting adverse operating leverage, as well as 2008 asset impairment charges of $758.3 million. In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by higher commodity costs (approximately $70 million excluding the benefit of price increases). Operating income benefited from a reduction in manufacturing, overhead and administrative cost structures. Restructuring and restructuring related charges were $55.6 million in 2008 compared to $96.3 million in 2007. Charges in 2008 related to supply chain realignment, capacity and cost reduction initiatives and the exit of select low return product offerings. Since December 31, 2006, we have reduced the number of Home and Hardware segment manufacturing facilities by 35%. Headcount reductions were implemented across all levels of the organization. We anticipate that these initiatives will generate savings that pay back the cash costs in three years or less. Restructuring and restructuring related charges in 2009 for currently approved projects are expected to be approximately $40 million, including non cash accelerated depreciation of approximately $20 million. We estimate that the overall U.S. home products market declined at an estimated high teens percentage rate in 2008, and we anticipate it will decline in 2009 in the range of 20%. As a result, we believe our sales in 2009 will be lower than 2008. Our business will continue to face margin pressures resulting from significant adverse operating leverage and potential increased price competition. In addition, we may see increases in bad debt expenses as our customers face increased financial pressures. We may also incur additional restructuring charges to further rationalize our supply chains. We will continue to strive to mitigate the impact of the downturn through ongoing cost reductions as well as through market share gain initiatives, successful extension of brands into new markets, expanding existing customer relationships, and building on our substantial presence in the replace and remodel segment of the U.S. home products market. Goodwill impairment charges in Home and Hardware of $451.3 million predominantly related to the Therma Tru entry door ($399.5 million) and Simonton ($48.8 million) reporting units, our two more recent acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to the impact of a worse than anticipated decline in the U.S. home products market on financial results, the Company concluded it 37 Table of Contents was necessary, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to conduct an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of this test, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $288.9 million. In the fourth quarter, the Company conducted its regular annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2008, and recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $162.4 million. The fourth quarter charges were primarily the result of the expectation for a slower recovery in the U.S. home products market, the current effect of the recession on the market, and our forecasts of the sales, operating income and cash flows of each reporting unit in the Home and Hardware business that were finalized through the course of our annual planning process. We forecast the U.S. home products market in two segments: the new home construction segment and the repair/remodel segment. For each reporting unit, the impairment charge was measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill was estimated based on a hypothetical allocation of each reporting units fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of FAS 142. Consistent with historical practice, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on an estimate of future cash flows discounted at a market participant derived weighted average cost of capital. Our estimate of discounted future cash flows decreased significantly from year end 2007 primarily due to a reduction of current year forecasted revenues and cash flows compared to our original plan (which resulted in projecting future revenue and cash flow growth off of a significantly lower base) and the shifting of cash flow growth beyond 2008 into later years. Our cash flow projections assumed declining revenue and cash flows in 2009 and that significant recovery would not begin until after 2010. At December 31, 2008, the Company had long lived assets in its Home and Hardware segment that totaled $2,952.2 million, including goodwill and indefinite lived tradenames of $1,461.8 million and $651.4 million, respectively. The dollar amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived tradenames associated with each of the reporting units within our Home and Hardware segment as of December 31, 2008 were as follows: ($ in millions) Reporting Unit Goodwill Indefinite lived Tradename Cabinet products $499.9 $205.5 Faucet products 569.7 107.2 Entry door products 101.2 171.0 Window products 84.4 127.0 Storage and security products 164.9 21.7 Other 41.7 19.0 Total $1,461.8 $651.4 While we are confident in the long term growth and return prospects for this segment, generally accepted accounting principles require us to assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived tradenames based upon current fair value. Goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level. Key to recoverability of our long lived assets is our forecast of the depth and duration of the U.S. home products market downturn, and its impact on future revenues, operating margins and cash flows. Our projection for the U.S. home products market and global economic conditions is inherently subject to a number of uncertain factors, such as the depth and duration of the global economic slowdown, as well as U.S. changes in home prices, unsold homes inventory levels, credit availability and borrowing rates, unemployment levels, and overall consumer confidence. In the near term, as we monitor the above factors, it is possible we may change the revenue and cash flow projections of our Home and Hardware segment, which may require the recording of additional asset impairment charges in accordance with the provisions of FAS 142, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 38 Table of Contents No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. We currently believe that the only reporting units with a risk of future goodwill or trade name impairment are our entry door products and window products reporting units. These reporting units are the most recently acquired (entry door products acquired in 2003 and window products acquired in 2006) and therefore have a historical cost that is closer to the current fair value. For these reporting units, a more than 10% decline in reporting unit fair value could trigger an impairment of goodwill, tradenames or long lived assets. In addition, as we continue to respond to the downturn in the U.S. home products market, our restructuring initiatives to reduce manufacturing capacity and administrative costs, and exit lower return product lines may result in further impairments of assets. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales decreased $143.3 million, or 3%, to $4,550.9 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the adverse impact of an estimated low double digit decline in the U.S. home products market. Sales benefited from the acquisition of Simonton ($182 million), new products and line extensions (approximately $428 million in total, particularly in faucets and related products, cabinetry and entry doors), share gains (including cabinetry, faucets, entry doors and security products), expansion with key customers, the impact of select commodity cost related price increases, and favorable foreign exchange. Operating income decreased $192.4 million, or 28%, to $503.0 million. Operating income was negatively impacted by lower underlying sales and the resulting unfavorable coverage of manufacturing and overhead costs, as well as higher restructuring and restructuring related costs related to supply chain initiatives (incremental $70 million). Price increases offset the effect of higher commodity costs (approximately $80 million, including the absence of commodity hedge gains in 2007). Operating income benefited from productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives, reduction in overhead and administrative costs, and facility closures/downsizing. Golf 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales decreased $36.5 million, or 3%, to $1,368.9 million. The sales decrease was primarily due to soft demand in the U.S., including the impact of lower consumer demand for discretionary purchases such as golf clubs, and the impact of a reduction in inventory by retailers. Net sales benefited from higher constant currency sales in Asian markets ($38 million), favorable foreign exchange ($17 million), and favorable mix ($17 million) as a result of new product introductions and sales of higher margin golf clubs. Operating income decreased $40.2 million, or 24%, to $125.3 million, primarily due to an increase in brand investment to support growth initiatives, lower sales and resulting adverse operating leverage, higher patent license expense, and increased commodity costs. During 2009, we expect to incur approximately $25 million of restructuring charges for workforce reduction costs to adjust our cost structure in response to the current and anticipated softening of the U.S. and European markets for golf products. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2008 against major foreign currencies associated with our Golf businesss international operations. If exchange rates as of December 31, 2008 remain in effect during 2009, our 2009 operating income may be negatively affected by approximately $25 to $35 million. 39 Table of Contents We expect the golf industry to benefit from favorable long term demographic trends, including an aging U.S. population (rounds of play increase with age and retirement), and the increasing popularity of golf internationally. In the near term, participation levels and consumer spending on golf products are expected to be adversely impacted by general economic conditions and declines in golf related travel and corporate spending. The United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A) establish standards for golf equipment used in the United States and outside the United States, respectively. In recent years, each of the USGA and the R&A has enacted new rules further restricting the dimensions or performance of golf clubs and golf balls. In March of 2005, the USGA and R&A requested that manufacturers participate in a golf ball research project by manufacturing and submitting balls that would conform to an overall distance standard that is 15 to 25 yards shorter than the current standard of 317 yards. As a result of their recent research regarding spin, the USGA has adopted a rule change, effective January 1, 2010, reducing the groove volume and limiting the groove edge angle allowable on all irons and wedges. The USGA and R&A have adopted a rule change to allow greater adjustability in golf clubs, which went into effect on January 1, 2008. Existing rules and any new rules could change the golf products industrys ability to innovate and deploy new technologies and the competitive dynamic among industry participants, potentially impacting our Golf business. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales increased $92.0 million, or 7%, to $1,405.4 million. The net sales increase was largely due to new product introductions, strong international growth, continued share gains in key product categories, and a favorable shift in golf ball demand to premium models. Net sales also benefited from higher sales in all product categories (golf balls, golf clubs, shoes, gloves and accessories), as well as favorable foreign exchange ($28 million). Operating income decreased $0.5 million to $165.5 million primarily on expenses related to international market expansion and investments in research and development, as well as higher patent litigation and related costs. These decreases were nearly offset by higher sales, as well as growth of premium golf balls and clubs. Corporate 2008 Compared to 2007 Corporate expenses of $57.8 million, which include salaries, benefits and expenses related to corporate office employees, decreased $1.1 million. 2007 Compared to 2006 Corporate expenses, which include salaries, benefits and expenses related to corporate office employees, as well as public company expenses, decreased $15.2 million, or 21%, to $58.9 million. These expenses decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense mainly resulting from lower expected payouts for long term incentive compensation programs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The global credit crisis and general economic conditions worsened in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, the recent volatility in capital and credit markets may continue and heighten risks in the near term. We believe, however, that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. 40 Table of Contents Liquidity Our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, service indebtedness and pay dividends, as well as finance acquisitions and share repurchases when deemed appropriate. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our credit agreements and long term notes. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate strategic options to increase shareholder value. We cannot predict whether or when we may enter into an acquisition, disposition, joint venture or other strategic options, or what impact any such transaction could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. Our committed unused credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current operating and financing needs. We believe all of our credit facilities are arranged with a strong and diversified group of financial institutions. We currently have an investment grade credit rating from three credit rating agencies. A downgrade of our credit ratings to non investment grade or a prolonged global economic decline and credit crisis may impact our access to long term capital markets, increase interest rates on our corporate debt, and weaken operating cash flow and liquidity, potentially impacting our ability to pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase shares in the future. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $817.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 compared to $965.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in cash provided of $147.7 million was principally due to lower net income, higher pension contributions ($114.5 million in 2008 compared to $48.9 million in 2007), an increase in inventories of maturing spirits in the Spirits business in 2008 compared to 2007 (including foreign exchange impacts), as well as taxes paid related to the 2007 sale of the U.S. Wine business. Cash flow was favorably impacted by income from termination of the Spirits U.S. distribution agreement ($143.5 million after tax) and a tax refund of $93.2 million. Net cash used for investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $274.2 million, compared to cash provided of $744.2 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. The increase in cash used of $1,018.4 million was primarily due to the acquisition of the Cruzan rum business ($103.2 million), as well as the absence of the 2007 proceeds from the sale of the U.S. Wine business ($948.3 million). We focus our capital spending on growth initiatives and becoming the lowest cost producers of the highest quality products. Net capital spending in 2008 was $157.1 million, $40.6 million lower than 2007 due to reduced capital spending in the Home and Hardware business resulting from the contraction of the U.S. home products market. We currently estimate 2009 net capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 to $175 million. We expect to generate these funds internally. Net cash used by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $555.8 million, compared with $1,713.0 million in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2007. The decrease of $1,157.2 million was primarily due the absence of 2007s paydown of debt from cash flow from operating activities and the sale of the U.S. Wine business ($948.3 million). In 2008, cash outflows were impacted by the redemption of the 10% minority interest in the Spirits business ($455.0 million) and share repurchases ($278.6 million). Capitalization Total debt increased $351.6 million during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2008 to $4.7 billion. The ratio of total debt to total capital increased to 50.1% at December 31, 2008 from 41.2% at 41 Table of Contents December 31, 2007 primarily due to the repurchase of the minority interest in the Spirits business, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to both foreign currency translation effects and deferred pension asset losses, and our common share repurchase activity. We have a $2.0 billion, 5 year committed revolving credit agreement, which matures in October 2010. A total of $790.0 million was outstanding under this credit agreement as of December 31, 2008. In October 2008, we executed a $400 million, 3 year term loan agreement with various banks, which matures in October 2011, and was used to repay a 300 million note due January 30, 2009. The interest rates under the term loan agreement are variable based on U.S. LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Companys long term credit rating. Our credit facilities are for general corporate purposes. The revolving credit agreement and term loan include a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio requirement of 3.5 to 1.0 as the only financial covenant. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is defined in the credit facilities as the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, as well as noncash restructuring and nonrecurring charges, losses from asset impairments, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of assets not in the ordinary course of business. Consolidated Interest Expense is as disclosed in the financial statements. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we exceeded this ratio by a wide margin. We currently believe the possibility of violating this covenant is remote. No other debt instruments require financial ratio covenants. Customer Credit Risk We routinely grant unsecured credit to customers in the normal course of business. Trade receivables total $918.5 million as of December 31, 2008 and are recorded at their stated amount less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. Allowances for doubtful accounts include provisions for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general formula basis when it is determined that some default is probable and estimable but not yet clearly associated with a specific customer. The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with our policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns was $57.5 million as of December 31, 2008. The current conditions in the global credit markets may reduce our customers ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and make our estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain. While we believe current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that the adverse impact of the U.S. housing downturn and the global credit crisis may cause significantly higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods. Counterparty Risk The counterparties to derivative contracts are major financial institutions. Although our theoretical risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments, we believe that the risk of incurring losses is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would be immaterial. The fair value of derivative assets at December 31, 2008 was $49.0 million. The estimated fair value of derivative contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. Insured Risks We review our exposure to insurance risk and believe that there are no material changes related to the availability and cost of liability, property, casualty, and other forms of insurance. We continue to closely monitor events and the ratings of insurance companies associated with our insurance programs. 42 Table of Contents Pension Plans We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that are partially funded by a portfolio of investments maintained within benefit plan trusts. Total pension plan cash contributions were $114.5 million and $48.9 million, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. As a result of our 2008 pension funding, we currently anticipate minimal pension funding will be required in 2009 for our defined benefit plans. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet the 2009 minimum funding that may be required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of our total pension plan assets was 82% of the accumulated benefit obligation liability. Minority Interest Held by V&S Group V&S Group owned a 10% interest in our Spirits business (BGSW). As a result of the sale of V&S to Pernod Ricard in April 2008, we exercised our call option to repurchase the minority interest, and in July 2008, we repurchased the minority interest for the carrying value of $455.0 million. We accounted for the redemption feature of the convertible redeemable preferred stock in accordance with EITF Topic D 98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, and measured this minority interest at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in income from continuing operations. BGSW is not a publicly traded entity and therefore there is no quoted market price for its common or preferred shares. At each reporting period prior to June 30, 2008, we estimated fair value based on a combination of market based earnings multiples and discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value at June 30, 2008 of $455.0 million was based upon the final settlement amount determined in connection with the repurchase of the minority interest. The valuation reflected the features of the preferred stock, which could not be sold to a third party and had unique shareholder rights as a preferred security. As a result, in the three months ended June 30, 2008, we recorded an $87.9 million decrease in the fair value of the minority interest as minority interest income. Dividends In July 2008, we increased the dividend on common stock 5% to an annual rate of $1.76 per common share. A summary of 2008 dividend activity for the Companys common stock is shown below: Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date $0.42 per share January 22, 2008 February 6, 2008 March 3, 2008 $0.42 per share April 29, 2008 May 14, 2008 June 2, 2008 $0.44 per share July 25, 2008 August 13, 2008 September 2, 2008 $0.44 per share September 30, 2008 November 12, 2008 December 1, 2008 A summary of 2008 dividend activity for the Companys $2.67 Convertible Preferred stock is shown below: Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date $0.6675 per share January 22, 2008 February 6, 2008 March 10, 2008 $0.6675 per share April 29, 2008 May 14, 2008 June 10, 2008 $0.6675 per share July 25, 2008 August 13, 2008 September 10, 2008 $0.6675 per share September 30, 2008 November 12, 2008 December 10, 2008 43 Table of Contents Adequacy of Liquidity Sources Given the uncertainty of global economic conditions and volatility in financial markets, we are focused on liquidity and capital preservation. We will continue to assess economic conditions as we evaluate funding of potential acquisitions, share repurchases and our dividend policy. We believe that our internally generated funds, together with access to global credit markets, are adequate to meet our long term and short term capital needs. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Item 1. Business Forward Looking Statements. Foreign Exchange We have investments in various foreign countries, principally Australia, Canada, Mexico, Spain, the U.K. and France. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our balance sheet and cash flow statements when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, in 2006 we issued euro denominated long term debt. See Note 9, Long Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Interest Rates We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount. We record the payments or receipts under the agreements as adjustments to interest expense. In the second quarter of 2008, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $400 million. The swap agreements hedged changes in fair value on a portion of our fixed rate 5.375% notes due 2016 that resulted from changes in a benchmark interest rate (U.S. LIBOR). The swaps were designated and were classified as fair value hedges in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In October 2008, we terminated and settled our swaps and recorded a $15.6 million gain that will be amortized to income as reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding during 2007. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our $4,693.6 million and $4,142.7 million total long term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $4,383.6 million and $4,005.6 million, respectively. The fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. Guarantees and Commitments Third party guarantees executed in connection with the formation of Maxxium, our Spirits international sales and distribution joint venture, totaled approximately $89 million as of December 31, 2008. We are required to perform under these guarantees in the event that Maxxium fails to make contractual payments. In conjunction with the third quarter 2008 execution of a Settlement Agreement providing for the withdrawal of R&eacute;my and V&S from Maxxium, Maxxiums credit facilities guaranteed by the joint venture partners were renegotiated with the banks, effective October 1, 2008. We guarantee one third of Maxxiums credit facilities that now expire March 31, 2009. Following expiration of the Maxxium facilities, we expect to finance operations of the new Spirits business international distribution alliance with a mix of local bank debt and shareholder facilities that may be guaranteed by the Company. 44 Table of Contents We also guarantee various leases for ACCO World Corporation, the Office business divested in a spin off in 2005. We will continue to guarantee payment of certain real estate leases with lease payments totaling approximately $29.5 million through April 2013. Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of these guarantees on our financial statements in accordance with FIN 45. The liability related to this guarantee was $0.7 million as of December 31, 2008. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table and discussion represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2008. (In millions) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2008 Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After5 years Short term borrowings $ 31.6 $ 31.6 $ $ $ Long term debt 4,693.6 424.4 1,540.0 999.1 1,730.1 Operating leases 205.0 57.8 80.5 48.7 18.0 Interest payments on long term debt 1,764.6 218.7 360.9 285.5 899.5 Purchase obligations(a) 702.9 271.7 153.2 101.8 176.2 Pension and postretirement contributions(b) 18.5 18.5 (a) Purchase obligations include contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; advertising, selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures. (b) Minimum required pension and postretirement contributions cannot be determined beyond 2009. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, $248.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above. See Note 16, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2008. These include the guarantee of certain credit facilities and bank loans entered into by Maxxium up to an amount totaling $88.9 million, all of which expires in less than one year; and a Shareholder Loan Facility executed by BGSW and Maxxium amounting to $21.0 million, of which $9.8 million was outstanding and which expires in less than one year. In addition, other corporate commercial commitments include Standby Letters of Credit of $79.0 million, of which $78.9 million expires in less than one year with the remaining $0.1 million expiring in one to three years; and Surety Bonds of $17.6 million of which $17.5 million expires in less than one year with the remaining $0.1 million expiring in one to three years. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. Derivative Financial Instruments In accordance with FAS 133 and its related amendment Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. 45 Table of Contents Derivative gains or losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2008, deferred currency gains of $3.9 million were reclassified to cost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2007, $15.4 million in deferred currency losses were reclassified to cost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2006, $1.9 million in deferred currency gains were reclassified to cost of sales. Based on the foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2008, we estimate that $34.5 million of currency derivative gains included in OCI as of December 31, 2008 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. Foreign Currency Risk Certain forecasted transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and British pound sterling. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of our euro denominated debt. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Interest Rate Risk We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. We also may, from time to time, enter into treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with fluctuation in interest rates related to anticipated issuances of new long term debt. See Note 18, Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K, for more information about the management of our interest rate risk. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Fair Value Measurement In February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP FAS 157 2), Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of FAS No. 157 for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (calendar 2009 for Fortune Brands). We have elected to defer the adoption of nonrecurring fair value measurement disclosures of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption of FSP FAS 157 2 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 (FAS 161), Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. FAS 161 establishes the disclosure requirements for derivatives instruments and for hedging activities in order to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of a) how and why derivatives are used, b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and c) how they affect financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 (calendar 2009 for Fortune Brands). FAS 161 will require additional disclosures on derivative instruments and hedging activities. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007) (FAS 141R), Business Combinations. FAS 141R replaces FAS No. 141, Business 46 Table of Contents Combinations. FAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer, a) recognizes and measures the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired and c) determines what information to disclose. FAS 141R also requires that all acquisition related costs, including restructuring, be recognized separately from the acquisition. FAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (calendar 2009 for Fortune Brands). This Statement eliminates adjustments to goodwill for changes in deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the acquisition accounting measurement period (limited to one year from acquisition), including for acquisitions prior to adoption of FAS 141R. The adoption of FAS 141R may result in increased volatility in the results of our operations to the extent that uncertain tax positions related to prior acquisitions are resolved more or less favorably than originally estimated. Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (FAS 160), Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. FAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest (currently referred to as minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement changes the consolidated balance sheet presentation of noncontrolling interests from the mezzanine level (between liabilities and stockholders equity) to a component of stockholders equity. As of December 31, 2008, the carrying value of minority interests/noncontrolling interests that would be reclassified to equity upon adoption of FAS 160 was $13.6 million. FAS 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary. FAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 (calendar 2009 for Fortune Brands). This statement applies prospectively except presentation and disclosure requirements are applied retrospectively for all periods presented. FAS 160 will have an impact on the presentation of noncontrolling interests on the Fortune Brands statements of income, financial position and stockholders equity. Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plans In December 2008, FASB issued Financial Statement of Position No. FAS 132(R) 1 (FSP FAS 132(R) 1), Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. FSP FAS 132(R) 1 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, providing guidance on an employers disclosures about plans assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. FSP FAS 132(R) 1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 (calendar year end 2009 for Fortune Brands). FSP FAS 132(R) 1 will require additional disclosure on plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the following are the Companys critical accounting policies due to the more significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our assumptions and estimates. 47 Table of Contents Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers potential insolvency), or discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns for continuing operations was $57.5 million and $53.8 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Inventories The first in, first out inventory method is our principal inventory method. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice, maturing spirits inventories are classified as current assets, although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one year due to the duration of aging processes. Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost of market value for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory turns and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes. Long lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, a long lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated using a quoted market price, or if unavailable, using discounted expected future cash flows. In 2008, we recorded long lived pre tax asset impairment charges of $183.8 million ($113.1 million after tax) for definite lived identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets in the Home and Hardware segment. For additional information, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis on the Home and Hardware segment in this Form 10 K. In addition, we recorded in restructuring expense pre tax non cash impairments of identifiable definite lived intangible assets of $7.5 million, as well as property, plant and equipment of $22.7 million. In 2007, we recorded in restructuring expense non cash impairments of identifiable definite lived intangible assets of $12.6 million, as well as property, plant and equipment of $37.0 million. Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangible Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and written down when 48 Table of Contents impaired. An interim impairment test is required if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or under certain circumstances, a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business. When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets (tangible and identifiable intangible assets) and related goodwill, we perform an impairment test to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. FAS 142 requires that purchased intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impact on that intangible. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Our predominant method of approximating fair value in determining whether an impairment exists is to use cash flow projections. We measure impairment based on discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the tradename compared to the carrying value of that tradename. When separate cash flow information is not available, we use the relief from royalty approach. Fair value is represented by the present value of hypothetical royalty income over the remaining useful life. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, the impact of the economic environment, particularly related to our Home and Hardware business; a material negative change in relationships with significant customers; or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement, post employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension liabilities and assets as well as pension expense on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans investments and our expectations for long term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a spot rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The bond portfolio used for the selection of the interest rates is from the top half of bonds rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and includes only non callable bonds and those that are deemed to be sufficiently marketable with a Moodys credit rating of Aa or higher. The discount rate as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 6.5% and 6.4%, respectively. 49 Table of Contents We use a market related value method of plan assets to calculate pension costs, recognizing each years asset gains or losses over a five year period. Compensation increases reflect expected future compensation trends. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the effects of deviations from assumptions are generally accumulated and, if over a specified corridor, amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees. The weighted average remaining service period for the pension plans at December 31, 2008 was approximately 10.8 years. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the related employees. The total net actuarial losses for all pension and postretirement benefit plans were $447 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $270 million from December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of actuarial losses during 2008 ($280 million primarily due to a decline in the fair value of pension assets), partly offset by amortization of loss recognition in pension expense ($8 million). We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the Companys plans are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For postretirement benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on historical cost increases and expectations for long term increases. As of December 31, 2008, for postretirement medical, our assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 6.75% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year, and, for postretirement prescription drugs, an assumed rate of increase of 9.75% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. Our assumption as of December 31, 2007 for postretirement medical was an assumed rate of increase of 7.5% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year, and, for postretirement prescription drugs, an assumed rate of increase of 10.5% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. Pension expenses were $32.5 million, $41.8 million and $43.3 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Postretirement expenses were $8.8 million, $9.3 million and $16.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. A 25 basis point change in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension expense and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for 2008. A 25 basis point change in the long term rate of return on plan assets used in accounting for the Companys pension plans would have a $2.3 million impact on pension expense. Income Taxes In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. We record liabilities for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax 50 Table of Contents positions that are currently estimated to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, zero tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded. The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the Companys estimates. In future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require the Company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling $248.4 million. It is reasonably possible the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $5 to $100 million in the next 12 months primarily as a result of the conclusion of U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings. Customer Program Costs Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in many of our businesses. These businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sell through of that businesss products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume allowances, are generally accounted for in either net sales or the category advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses at the time the program is initiated and or the revenue is recognized. The costs recognized in net sales include, but are not limited to, general customer program generated expenses, cooperative advertising programs, volume allowances and promotional allowances. The costs typically recognized in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses include point of sale materials. These costs are recorded at the time of sale based on managements best estimates. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals, when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). Cost Initiatives We continuously evaluate the productivity of our supply chains and existing asset base, and actively seek to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure. Future opportunities may involve, among other things, the reorganization of operations, the relocation of manufacturing or assembly to locations generally having lower costs and the efficient sourcing of products or components from third party suppliers. Implementing any significant cost reduction and efficiency opportunities could result in charges. Pending Litigation See Note 25, Pending Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. Environmental Matters We are involved in numerous remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. As of February 1, 2009, several of our subsidiaries had been designated as potentially responsible parties (PRP) under Superfund or similar state laws in 50 instances. Of these instances, 31 have been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In calendar year 2008, we were 51 Table of Contents identified as a PRP in two new instances, and three PRP claims were dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. The average settlement was approximately $56,539. In January 2009, an additional PRP claim was resolved for $1,667. In most instances where we are named as a PRP, we enter into cost sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other responsible parties or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had accruals of $29.1 million and $32.1 million, respectively, to cover environmental compliance and clean up including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The counterparties are major financial institutions. Interest Rate Risk The disclosure about interest rate risk required to be provided under this item is set forth under Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rates and is incorporated herein by reference. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Companys variable rate borrowings would impact pre tax interest expense by $8.5 million. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions. We periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. As indicated in the analysis that follows, the estimated potential loss under foreign exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value at risk (VAR) computation to estimate the potential economic loss that we could incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The VAR estimations are intended to measure the maximum amount of our loss from foreign exchange contracts due to adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates, given a specified confidence level, over a given period of time. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques. Also, the use of the VAR model should not be construed as an endorsement of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions. 52 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our estimated loss under the VAR model as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in the VAR results from more foreign exchanges contracts and greater volatility in the foreign exchange markets. (In millions) Estimated Amount of Loss Period ConfidenceLevel 2008 foreign exchange $ 7.2 1 day 95% 2007 foreign exchange $ 1.6 1 day 95% The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange contracts would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. We use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility. The exposures under these contracts could be material to our financial statements. 53 Table of Contents
