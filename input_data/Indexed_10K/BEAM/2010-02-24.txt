We strive to enhance shareholder value in a variety of ways, including: &gt; profitably building leading consumer brands to drive sales and earnings growth and enhance returns on a long term basis, &gt; positioning our brands and businesses to outperform their respective markets. We do this by: &gt; developing innovative new products and effective marketing programs, &gt; expanding customer relationships, &gt; extending brands into adjacent categories, and &gt; developing international growth opportunities, 26 Table of Contents &gt; pursuing business improvements by operating lean and flexible supply chains and business processes, &gt; promoting organizational excellence by developing winning cultures and associates, and &gt; leveraging our breadth and balance and financial resources to drive shareholder value. While our first priority is internal growth, we continue to focus on paying down debt. We also strive to create shareholder value through add on acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. In addition, we enhance shareholder value through other initiatives, such as using our financial resources to pay dividends and repurchase shares. For a description of certain factors that may have had, or may in the future have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. In 2009, net income attributable to Fortune Brands and diluted earnings per share decreased 22% and 21%, respectively, compared to 2008. Income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 53% and 55%, respectively. Sales decreased 12% to $6.7 billion. Sales were unfavorably impacted by: &gt; the effect of the global economic environment and reduced consumer discretionary spending on all of our businesses, &gt; the downturn in the U.S. housing products market and its impact on our Home & Security business, and &gt; unfavorable foreign exchange ($135 million). Sales benefited from: &gt; the impact of acquisitions (approximately $106 million) &gt; successful new products and line extensions in all segments, &gt; selected price increases in the Spirits and Home & Security businesses, and &gt; market share gains, principally in the Home & Security and Golf segments. Income from continuing operations benefited from: &gt; lower asset impairment charges in 2009 ($66.8 million after tax) compared to 2008 ($659.4 million after tax), &gt; reduced cost structures, &gt; lower advertising, selling, and general and administrative expenses ($56.2 million), and &gt; the absence of write downs of the Spirits businesss investment in Maxxium Worldwide B.V. (Maxxium) recorded in 2008 ($50.5 million). Income from continuing operations was unfavorably impacted by: &gt; lower sales and related unfavorable operating leverage, and &gt; the absence of gains recorded in 2008: &gt; income due to the termination of the Spirits U.S. distribution agreement and the related deferred gain recognition ($190.8 million after tax in aggregate), 27 Table of Contents &gt; income tax related credits of $98.4 million associated with the favorable resolution of uncertain income tax positions, and &gt; a gain due to the reduction in the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the Spirits business ($81.9 million after tax). In 2009, we paid 49.9 million (approximately $66.2 million, net of cash acquired) to purchase 100% interest in seven subsidiaries of Maxxium, our former international spirits sales and distribution joint venture. In addition, we paid 30.9 million (approximately $41.7 million) to acquire 50% ownership in five Maxxium joint venture entities. In addition, in 2009, we acquired the EFFEN super premium vodka brand and related assets from the Sazerac Company, Inc. In conjunction with this transaction, we sold the Old Taylor whiskey brand and assets to Sazerac Company, Inc. In 2008, we acquired the premium Cruzan rum business from Pernod Ricard S.A. (Pernod Ricard) for $103.2 million in cash. In addition, we repurchased the 10% noncontrolling interest in our Spirits business from Vin & Sprit Group (V&S) for $455.0 million. We also redeemed the 49% interest in our Spirits businesss U.S. distribution joint venture held by V&S. In a related transaction, we received $230.0 million from Pernod Ricard for early termination of the U.S. distribution agreement with V&S subsequent to its acquisition by Pernod Ricard. In 2007, we sold our remaining U.S. wine assets to Constellation Brands for $887.0 million, after selling two wine brands and related assets to E. & J. Gallo Winery. In addition, in 2007, we sold the U.S. distribution rights and related assets for The Dalmore Scotch Whisky for $58.0 million, resulting in a gain on the sale of $28.5 million, net of tax. In 2010, we expect to: &gt; remain focused on our initiatives designed to outperform our markets, &gt; benefit from the strength of our brands and new products across all segments, and &gt; continue targeted brand building investment, as well as innovation and expansion into new markets, including international growth opportunities in all of our segments. We have also identified certain risks and challenges that may impact our businesses in 2010 including: &gt; current economic conditions, including the decrease in consumer discretionary spending and consumers trading down to lower priced products, &gt; continuing uncertainty with regard to the overall U.S. home products market, and &gt; changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further description of risks and uncertainties that may be material to our businesses. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2009 Compared to 2008 Net Sales Net sales decreased $914.2 million, or 12%, to $6.7 billion primarily due to: &gt; the impact of the slowdown in the global economy and reduced consumer discretionary spending on all of our businesses, 28 Table of Contents &gt; the downturn in the U.S. home products markets and its impact on our Home & Security business, and &gt; unfavorable foreign exchange (approximately $135 million). Sales benefited from: &gt; the impact of acquisitions (approximately $106 million, including Cruzan rum and sales of third party brands within distribution businesses acquired from Maxxium, our former international spirits sales and distribution joint venture), &gt; newly introduced products and line extensions in all segments, &gt; selected price increases in the Spirits and Home & Security businesses and &gt; market share gains, principally in the Home & Security and Golf segments. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold decreased $494.3 million, or 12%, primarily due to lower sales across all segments and cost reduction programs in the Home & Security and Golf businesses. Excise taxes on spirits Excise taxes on spirits were up 69 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year due to higher Spirits segment sales as a percentage of total Company sales. Excise taxes are generally levied based on the alcohol content of spirits products and vary significantly by country. Consistent with industry practice, excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in net sales and the corresponding payments to governments in expenses. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $56.2 million, or 3%, primarily as a result of lower variable sales related expenses and a decrease in advertising and promotion spending, partly offset by increased operating costs associated with our U.S. and international sales and distribution initiatives in our Spirits business and higher incentive compensation expense. Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets decreased $15.9 million to $33.7 million due to the impact of intangible asset impairment charges for definite lived intangible assets in 2008. Asset impairment charges In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $92.5 million ($66.8 million after tax) primarily related to indefinite lived tradenames for Sauza tequila in the Spirits business. The Company remains confident in the long term growth prospects for our Spirits brands; however, these charges were a result of the combined effect of the current economic downturn on sales in key geographic markets, particularly Mexico and the U.S., and the expectation of more moderate market growth rates for the overall tequila spirits category for the foreseeable future. For additional information, refer to the Results of Operations for the Spirits segment. In 2008, we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges in the Home & Security and Spirits businesses of $785.5 million ($659.4 million after tax). The Home & Security charges of $758.3 million 29 Table of Contents included write downs of goodwill, tradenames and other long lived assets. For additional information, refer to the Results of Operations for the Home & Security segment. In addition, we recorded a $27.2 million write down of certain non U.S. regional Spirits tradenames. Restructuring charges In the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $81.9 million. These charges related to workforce reductions across all segments ($60.2 million), including the announced closure of seven Home & Security manufacturing facilities in the U.S., the closure of a golf shoe manufacturing facility, and the announced closure of a spirits facility next year. Fixed asset write downs totaled $10.3 million. In addition, we recorded $11.4 million for lease contract termination and other costs, as well as reductions in general and administrative costs, and charges associated with our Spirits business repositioning. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $81.8 million. Home & Security business charges ($49.5 million in total) primarily related to supply chain initiatives designed to align costs and capacities with marketplace conditions, including the announced closing of six manufacturing facilities. Charges also included costs to exit from select low return product offerings ($10.5 million). In addition, we recorded charges in the Spirits business ($32.3 million) related to business repositioning, including supply chain activities and sales and distribution initiatives in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income Operating income increased $359.6 million, or 247%, primarily due to lower asset impairment charges ($693.0 million), and to a lesser degree from reduced cost structures and lower advertising promotion spending. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by lower sales and related adverse operating leverage, higher costs in our Spirits business associated with our enhanced sales and distribution structures, and an unfavorable comparison to a lower level of incentive compensation in 2008. Interest expense Interest expense decreased $21.3 million, or 9%, to $215.8 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates. Other expense (income), net Other expense increased $285.9 million to net expense of $6.0 million, predominantly due to the absence of the following items recognized in 2008: &gt; income of $230.0 million from Pernod Ricard for the early termination of Future Brands U.S. spirits distribution agreement, &gt; $72.0 million of remaining unamortized deferred income from the initial establishment of the Future Brands, and &gt; deferred income of $20.3 million related to Future Brands as a result of the purchase of the remaining balance of the noncontrolling interest in September 2008. Other expense (income), net, benefited from a $12.5 million gain on a Maxxium dividend distribution and the absence of a 2008 $50.5 million write down of our investment in Maxxium that was recorded to reflect our share of a goodwill write down recorded in the financial statements of Maxxium. Other expense (income), net, also includes non operating income and expense, such as interest income and transaction gains/losses related to foreign currency denominated transactions. 30 Table of Contents Income taxes The effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 12.8% and 50.7%, respectively. The 2009 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by higher 2009 restructuring and other charges in the U.S. taxed at a higher rate. In addition, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a higher proportion of foreign income in 2009, which is taxed at a lower rate relative to U.S. income. The 2009 income tax rate was also favorably impacted by annual true up adjustments related to tax returns filed in the current period. The 2009 income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by net tax expense of $13.3 million related to the correction of prior year items. These prior year items, primarily related to goodwill tax benefits, net operating loss carryforwards, and certain deferred tax adjustments, were determined to be immaterial to the years to which they relate. The 2008 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a $98.4 million tax benefit related to the final settlement of the federal income tax audit related to our 2001 2002 federal tax returns, tax credits associated with the conclusion of our 2004 2005 federal tax audit, and non goodwill impairment and restructuring charges benefited at higher U.S. tax rates. The 2008 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the absence of a tax benefit on goodwill impairment charges of $451.3 million and a $50.5 million write down of our investment in the Maxxium joint venture, as well as income associated with the termination of the Spirits businesss U.S. distribution agreement at the higher U.S. tax rate. Noncontrolling interests Noncontrolling interest expense was $4.3 million in 2009 compared to income of $65.8 million last year. The unfavorable change of $70.1 million was primarily due to the $87.9 million gain recorded in 2008 from a reduction in the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the Spirits business repurchased in July 2008, partially offset by absence of $9.8 million of preferred dividends paid to the noncontrolling interest and expenses associated with the repurchase of the noncontrolling interest. Income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders Income from continuing operations was $242.8 million, or $1.61 per basic share and $1.60 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. These results compared to $158.6 million, or $1.04 per basic share and $1.03 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. The $84.2 million increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher operating income as a result of lower asset impairment charges ($592.6 million), as well as 2008 write downs of the Spirits businesss investment in Maxxium ($50.5 million) and the 2009 gain on a Maxxium dividend distribution ($12.5 million). Income from continuing operations was unfavorably impacted by the absence of the following items recognized in 2008: &gt; income from the termination of the Spirits U.S. distribution agreement and the related deferred gain recognition ($190.8 million after tax in aggregate), &gt; a gain due to a reduction in the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the Spirits business ($81.9 million), and &gt; tax related credits ($98.4 million). 31 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Net Sales Net sales decreased $954.2 million, or 11%, to $7.6 billion primarily due to: &gt; the downturn in the U.S. home products market and its impact on our Home & Security business, &gt; weak consumer sentiment that reduced demand for discretionary purchases, including its adverse impact on our Home & Security and Golf businesses, and &gt; lower sales in certain markets in the Spirits business, including the impact of an Australian excise tax increase on ready to drink spirit products. Sales benefited from: &gt; newly introduced products and line extensions across all businesses (approximately $241 million in total, net of discontinued products), &gt; price increases implemented to offset higher costs for materials in the Home & Security business, as well as targeted price increases in the Spirits business, and &gt; growth in international markets in the Golf business. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold decreased $519.8 million, or 11%, primarily on lower sales, as well as cost reduction programs, global sourcing initiatives and productivity improvements. These factors were partly offset by adverse operating leverage, as well as higher commodity costs (approximately $85 90 million). Excise taxes on spirits Excise taxes on spirits were up 65 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year due to lower Home & Security sales and higher international spirits sales where we are the obligor as a percentage of spirits sales. Excise taxes are generally levied based on the alcohol content of spirits products. Consistent with industry practice, excise taxes collected from customers are reflected in net sales and the corresponding payments to governments are reflected in expenses. Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $38.0 million, or 2%, primarily due to lower sales related variable costs and cost reductions in the Home & Security business, partly offset by the costs for organization repositioning and sales and distribution initiatives in the Spirits business, as well as increased brand investment in the Golf business to support growth initiatives. Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $2.0 million, or 4%, primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates. Asset impairment charges We recorded pre tax asset impairment charges in the Home & Security and Spirits businesses of $785.5 million ($659.4 million after tax). The Home & Security charges of $758.3 million included write downs of goodwill, tradenames and other long lived assets. These charges were a result of the 32 Table of Contents impact of a steeper than anticipated decline in the U.S. home products market and the general economy in 2008, as well as the expectation of a slower than previously anticipated recovery. For additional information, refer to the Results of Operations for the Home & Security segment. In addition, we recorded a $27.2 million write down of certain non U.S. regional Spirits tradenames in 2008. Restructuring charges In the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $81.8 million. Home & Security business charges ($49.5 million in total) primarily related to supply chain initiatives designed to align costs and capacities with marketplace conditions, including the announced closing of eight manufacturing facilities. Charges also included costs to exit from select low return product offerings ($10.5 million). In addition, we recorded charges in the Spirits business ($32.3 million) related to business repositioning, including supply chain activities and sales and distribution initiatives in the U.S. and internationally. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $73.5 million (Home & Security $70.2 million, Spirits $2.7 million and Golf $0.6 million). Operating Income Operating income decreased $1,230.7 million to $145.6 million, primarily due to asset impairment charges of $785.5 million, lower sales in the Home & Security and Golf businesses and resulting adverse operating leverage, higher commodity costs, increased brand investment in the Golf business, and the absence of the 2007 gain on the sale of The Dalmore Scotch Whisky U.S. distribution rights and related assets ($45.6 million). Operating income benefited from new products and line extensions, price increases (implemented to offset higher commodity costs in the Home & Security business and in the Spirits business), cost reduction programs, global sourcing initiatives, and productivity improvements. Interest expense Interest expense decreased $56.5 million, or 19%, primarily as a result of lower average debt, as well as lower average interest rates. Other income, net Other income, net, increased $242.4 million, predominantly due to $230.0 million of cash received from Pernod Ricard for the early termination of the Spirits U.S. distribution agreement, as well as $72.0 million due to recognition of remaining unamortized deferred income from the initial establishment of the joint venture. These amounts were partially offset by a $50.5 million write down of our investment in Maxxium. Other income, net, also includes non operating income and expense, such as interest income and transaction gains/losses related to foreign currency denominated transactions. Income taxes The effective income tax rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 50.7% and 30.9%, respectively. The 2008 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the absence of a tax benefit on goodwill impairment charges of $451.3 million and a $50.5 million write down of our investment in the Maxxium joint venture, as well as income associated with termination of the Spirits businesss U.S. distribution agreement at the higher U.S. tax rate. The 2008 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a $98.4 million tax benefit related to final settlement of the federal income tax audit of our 2001 2002 federal tax returns. Additionally, the effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by tax credits associated with the conclusion of our 2004 2005 federal 33 Table of Contents income tax audit, non goodwill impairment charges and higher restructuring charges in 2008 benefitted at higher U.S. tax rates, and a higher portion of foreign income taxed at lower statutory rates. Noncontrolling interests Noncontrolling interest income was $65.8 million in 2008 compared to expense of $24.4 million in 2007. The favorable change of $90.2 million was primarily due to an $87.9 million gain from a reduction in the fair value of the 10% noncontrolling interest in the Spirits business based upon the final settlement amount determined in connection with our repurchase of the noncontrolling interest in July 2008. Income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders Income from continuing operations was $92.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. These results compared to $773.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. The $681.1 million decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to lower operating income (including asset impairment charges of $659.4 million after tax) and write downs of the Spirits businesss investment in Maxxium ($50.5 million). Income from continuing operations benefited from income due to the termination of the Spirits U.S. distribution agreement and the related deferred gain recognition ($190.8 million after tax in aggregate), as well as a gain due to a reduction in the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the Spirits business ($81.9 million), lower interest expense and tax related credits ($98.4 million). Income from discontinued operations Income from discontinued operations was $152.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, or $1.01 per basic share and $0.99 per diluted share. This included pre tax income of $4.0 million (after tax $2.5 million) from the settlement of outstanding working capital claims related to the sale of the U.S. Wine business. We also recorded a $43.1 million tax benefit related to finalization of the tax accounting for the sale of the U.S. Wine business and tax credits associated with the conclusion of our 2004 2005 federal income tax audit that pertained to other discontinued operations. In addition, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completed its review of a tax refund associated with a capital loss carryforward item that was favorably resolved in an IRS administrative proceeding relating to our 2001 2002 federal tax returns. As a result, the final settlement of the audit of our 2001 2002 federal tax returns removed uncertainty relating to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward, and we recorded a $98.0 million tax benefit ($98.7 million unrecognized tax benefit less interest of $0.7 million) related to a capital loss carryforward position associated with the sale of the U.S. Wine business. This compared to income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 of $13.1 million, or $0.09 per basic share and $0.08 per diluted share. 34 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Spirits 2009 Compared to 2008 Net sales were flat compared to 2008 on higher U.S. sales offset by lower international sales. Net sales in the U.S. were higher due to the benefit of acquisitions (approximately $106 million, including Cruzan rum and sales of third party brands within distribution businesses acquired from Maxxium), higher pricing, the introduction of new products, and our U.S. distributor program that has resulted in more stable wholesale inventory levels. U.S. net sales were unfavorably impacted by weak industry conditions. International net sales decreased on unfavorable foreign exchange ($51 million). In addition, net sales were lower on a constant currency basis in certain markets largely due to economic weakness in Western Europe and Mexico, the impact of a 2008 Australian excise tax increase on ready to drink products, and a change in distributors in Mexico. Operating income decreased $59.0 million, or 11%, to $484.7 million. Operating income was lower due to higher tradename impairment charges ($92.5 million in 2009 compared to $27.2 million in 2008), increased operating costs associated with our enhanced U.S. and international sales and distribution structures (approximately $40 million) and unfavorable foreign exchange. Operating income benefited from lower advertising and promotional spending, select price increases, and lower restructuring and other charges ($33.3 million). The Spirits business had indefinite lived tradenames with a carrying value of $1,905.4 million as of December 31, 2009. In connection with our regular annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $92.5 million, primarily related to the indefinite lived tradename for Sauza tequila, reducing the book value of the impaired brands to $782.8 million in aggregate. Because these tradenames were acquired in 2005, their fair value more closely approximates their book value. The Company remains confident in the long term growth prospects for our Spirits brands; however, generally accepted accounting principles require that indefinite lived tradenames be valued based on their current fair value. The impairment charges were recorded to reflect a decline in the estimated fair value of these impaired tradenames below their book value in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangibles assets (ASC 350). For the impaired tradenames, we believe the current fair value has declined below book value primarily due to the combined effect of the current economic downturn on sales in key geographic markets, particularly Mexico and the U.S., and the expectation of more moderate market growth rates for the overall tequila spirits category for the foreseeable future. We estimate fair value using a standard relief from royalty method which estimates the present value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the brand name to a third party. This method is consistent with the method we have employed in prior periods and the method employed to value the tradenames at the date of their original acquisition. In our methodology, the most important judgments and estimates that influence a tradenames fair value include the expected branded product sales included in our final 2010 to 2012 operating plans, longer term market growth rates in particular spirits categories and geographies, expected profit margins on products sold using the brands, terminal value revenue growth rates, and the weighted average cost of capital. The Company has certain indefinite lived tradenames in its Spirits business for which a more than 10% reduction in the fair value would trigger an impairment charge in future periods. These tradenames had an aggregate book value of $865.9 million as of December 31, 2009. We expect to incur additional restructuring and other charges of approximately $15 20 million over the next twelve to eighteen months related to our previously announced organization repositioning and U.S. supply chain initiatives. These initiatives have been undertaken to align the business closer to customers and consumers and to support brand building and long term profitable growth. 35 Table of Contents In October of 2009, we entered into a long term agreement with the U.S. Virgin Islands to continue to produce rum on St. Croix. The mutually beneficial agreement is structured to promote increased tax revenue for the U.S. Virgin Islands and to provide cost effective production of rum for our Spirits business. In September 2008, Beam Global Spirits & Wine, Inc. (BGSW) and The Edrington Group Ltd. (TEG) entered into an agreement establishing an international distribution alliance that is a combination of jointly owned and Company owned sales forces in 24 markets. Operations under the new alliance began on April 1, 2009. This alliance simplifies our international routes to market and gives us greater control over our distribution. The alliance provides that BGSW and TEG have joint 50 50 ownership of sales and distribution companies in certain markets and that BGSW wholly owned or TEG wholly owned distribution companies distribute both companies products and third party products in certain other markets. Prior to April 1, 2009, BGSW was a 25% partner in the Maxxium international sales and distribution joint venture. The other equal partners in Maxxium were R&eacute;my Cointreau S.A. (R&eacute;my), V&S and TEG. In accordance with a Settlement Agreement executed in September 2008, on March 30, 2009, R&eacute;my and V&S exited the Maxxium joint venture and BGSW became a 50% owner of Maxxium with TEG. BGSW and TEG are facilitating an orderly transition or winding down of Maxxium operations, which is now substantially complete. Factors that could adversely affect future results in our Spirits business include consumers trading down to lower price points, competitive pricing activities, changes in customer inventory levels in international markets, potential impairment charges, the possibility of future excise and other tax increases globally, regulatory enforcement trends, and reduction of government financial incentives related to our rum production. 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales decreased $125.9 million, or 5%, to $2,480.9 million, primarily due to the decline in sales from the adverse impact of an unexpected Australian excise tax on ready to drink spirits products instituted in April (approximately $47 million), the impact of the wind down of transitional manufacturing agreements with Pernod Ricard to produce certain products subsequent to a 2005 acquisition (approximately $28 million), the impact of reduced fourth quarter 2008 sales due to a new U.S. distributor program that facilitates lower and more consistent U.S. distributor inventory levels going forward, and unfavorable foreign exchange ($25 million). In addition, economic pressures resulted in lower net sales in certain markets, particularly Spain, Germany and Mexico (approximately $32 million in aggregate). The sales of our portfolio of brands continued to shift toward the premium end, though at a slower rate. In addition, sales benefited from the impact of price and mix (approximately $35 million in aggregate) and the acquisition of Cruzan rum ($12.5 million). Operating income decreased $223.0 million, or 29%, to $543.7 million, primarily due to lower sales and $63.6 million in restructuring and other charges related to business repositioning, including supply chain activities and sales and distribution initiatives, as well as absence of the 2007 gain on the sale of The Dalmore U.S. distribution rights and assets ($45.6 million) and a 2008 write down of certain non U.S. regional tradenames ($27.2 million). In addition, operating income was impacted by higher operating expenses (approximately $12 million), primarily due to increased information technology costs and U.S. distribution costs. Home & Security 2009 Compared to 2008 Net sales decreased $752.3 million, or 20%, to $3,006.8 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the downturn in the U.S. housing and home products market and the U.S. economic recession. These factors resulted in lower repair and remodeling spending, particularly on big ticket 36 Table of Contents items such as cabinetry and entry doors, and a substantial decrease in new home construction, as well as a mix shift to lower priced products. Net sales benefited from share gains with key customers, the impact of select price increases, and new products and line extensions. Operating income increased $552.6 million to income of $87.0 million, primarily due to asset impairment charges recorded in 2008 that did not recur in 2009 ($758.3 million) and cost reduction and supply chain improvements in all areas of the business in 2009. These were partially offset by continuing adverse operating leverage from substantially lower sales and an unfavorable mix shift. Restructuring and other charges were slightly lower in 2009 ($52.0 million in 2009 compared to $55.6 million in 2008). In 2009, we announced the closure of seven additional plants in addition to six closures announced in 2008. Since December 31, 2006, we have reduced the number of Home & Security segment manufacturing facilities and positions by approximately 40%. Headcount reductions have been implemented across all levels of the organization. We anticipate that these initiatives will generate savings that pay back the cash costs in three years or less. Restructuring and restructuring related charges for currently approved projects are expected to be approximately $5 million in 2010. We estimate that the categories of the U.S. home products market in which we compete declined in 2009 in the range of 20%. While we expect the market will be relatively stable in 2010, we may face higher raw material costs, and in the event the market continues to decline, our business may face pressures, including the impact of adverse operating leverage. We will continue to strive to mitigate the impact of the weak market conditions through ongoing cost reductions, as well as through market share gain initiatives, successful extension of brands into new markets, and expanding existing customer relationships. There were no goodwill or indefinite lived tradename impairment charges recorded in the Home & Security business in 2009. At December 31, 2009, the Company had long lived assets in its Home & Security segment that totaled $2,900.3 million, including goodwill and indefinite lived tradenames of $1,452.7 million and $662.6 million, respectively. The dollar amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived tradenames associated with each of the reporting units within our Home & Security segment as of December 31, 2009 were as follows: ($ in millions) Reporting Unit Goodwill Indefinite lived Tradename Cabinet products $ 490.3 $ 216.7 Faucet products 569.7 107.2 Entry door products 142.9 190.0 Window products 84.4 127.0 Storage and security products 165.4 21.7 Total $ 1,452.7 $ 662.6 While we are confident in the long term growth and return prospects for this segment, generally accepted accounting principles require us to assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived tradenames based upon current fair value. Goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level. Key to estimating the fair value of our long lived assets is our forecast of the depth and duration of the U.S. home products market downturn, and its impact on future revenues, operating margins and cash flows. Our projection for the U.S. home products market and global economic conditions is inherently subject to a number of uncertain factors, such as the depth and duration of the global economic slowdown, as well as U.S. changes in home prices, unsold homes inventory levels, credit availability and borrowing rates, unemployment levels, and overall consumer confidence. In the near term, as we monitor the above factors, it is possible we may change the revenue and cash flow projections of our 37 Table of Contents Home & Security segment, which may require the recording of additional asset impairment charges in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as property, plant and equipment. We currently believe that the reporting unit with a higher risk of future goodwill or trade name impairment is our window products reporting unit. This reporting unit is the most recently acquired (in 2006) and therefore has a cost that is closest to the current fair value. For our window products reporting unit, a more than 10% decline in reporting unit fair value could trigger an impairment of goodwill, its tradename or long lived assets. In addition, as we continue to respond to the current conditions in the U.S. home products market, it is possible we may initiate restructuring actions to reduce manufacturing capacity and administrative costs, which may result in further impairments of assets. 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales decreased $791.8 million, or 17%, to $3,759.1 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the downturn in the U.S. home products market, which deteriorated as the year progressed due to the U.S. economic recession, the credit crisis, decreasing home prices and declining consumer confidence. The combination of these factors contributed to further reductions in new home construction and a shift to lower priced products, and also adversely impacted big ticket repair and remodeling, which historically has been more stable in housing downturns. Sales benefited from new products and line extensions (approximately $336 million in total, particularly in faucets and cabinetry), continued extension of brands into adjacent product categories, market share gains in key product categories (faucets and security products), and the impact of select price increases. Operating income decreased $968.6 million resulting in a loss of $465.6 million, primarily due to lower sales and resulting adverse operating leverage, as well as 2008 asset impairment charges of $758.3 million. In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by higher commodity costs (approximately $70 million excluding the benefit of price increases). Operating income benefited from a reduction in manufacturing, overhead and administrative cost structures. Restructuring and other charges were $55.6 million in 2008 compared to $96.3 million in 2007. Charges in 2008 related to supply chain realignment, capacity and cost reduction initiatives and the exit of select low return product offerings. Goodwill impairment charges in Home & Security of $451.3 million in 2008 predominantly related to our Therma Tru entry door ($399.5 million) and Simonton ($48.8 million) reporting units, our two most recent acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to the impact of a worse than anticipated decline in the U.S. home products market on financial results, the Company concluded it was necessary, in accordance with authoritative guidance on goodwill (ASC 350) to conduct an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of this test, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $288.9 million. In the fourth quarter, the Company conducted its regular annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2008, and recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $162.4 million. The fourth quarter charges were primarily the result of the expectation for a slower recovery than previously expected in the U.S. home products market, the current effect of the recession on the market, and our forecasts of the sales, operating income and cash flows of each reporting unit in the Home & Security business that were finalized through the course of our annual planning process. We forecast the U.S. home products market in two segments: the new home construction segment and the repair/remodel segment. The impairments at Therma Tru and Simonton occurred because these reporting units are most significantly impacted by new home construction and are the most recently acquired (and therefore have newer historical carrying values). In the Home & Security 38 Table of Contents segment, our reporting units are components one level below the Home & Security operating segment that generally correspond to our major product lines and related brands. For each reporting unit, the goodwill impairment charges were measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill was estimated based on a hypothetical allocation of each reporting units fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets. Consistent with historical practice, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimate projection of future cash flows discounted at a market participant derived weighted average cost of capital. Our estimate of discounted future cash flows decreased significantly from year end 2007 primarily due to a reduction of current year forecasted revenues and cash flows compared to our original plan (which resulted in projecting future revenue and cash flow growth off of a significantly lower base) and the shifting of cash flow growth beyond 2008 into later years. As of December 31, 2008, our cash flow projections assumed declining revenue and cash flows in 2009 and that significant recovery would not begin until after 2010. In addition, the fair value declined due to an increase in our weighted average cost of capital. Golf 2009 Compared to 2008 Net sales decreased $150.6 million, or 11%, to $1,218.3 million, primarily due to the impact of decreased demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, particularly for golf clubs and custom golf balls, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange ($52 million). Net sales benefited from market share gains and a double digit percentage increase in constant currency sales in Asian markets. Operating income decreased $100.3 million, or 80%, to $25.0 million primarily due to lower sales and related unfavorable operating leverage, restructuring and other charges of $35.2 million, mainly related to workforce reductions and the closure of a footwear manufacturing facility, unfavorable foreign currency ($21 million), and higher incentive compensation expense. Operating income benefited from cost recovery actions and lower operating expenses, including reduced advertising and promotion, and lower discretionary expenses. While we expect golfers to remain cautious in 2010, we expect the golf industry to benefit from favorable long term demographic trends, including an aging U.S. population (rounds of play increase with age and retirement), and the increasing popularity of golf internationally. The United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A) establish standards for golf equipment used in the United States and outside the United States, respectively. In recent years, both the USGA and the R&A have enacted new rules further restricting the dimensions or performance of golf clubs and golf balls. In March 2005, the USGA and R&A requested that manufacturers participate in a golf ball research project by manufacturing and submitting balls that would conform to an overall distance standard that is 15 to 25 yards shorter than the current standard of 317 yards. More recently, they adopted a rule change to allow greater adjustability in golf clubs, which went into effect January 1, 2008. In August 2008, the USGA and R&A adopted a rule change, effective January 1, 2010, further restricting golf club grooves by reducing the groove volume and limiting the groove edge angle allowable on irons and wedges. This rules change will not apply to most golfers until January 1, 2024. It will be implemented on professional tours beginning in 2010 and then in other elite amateur competitions beginning 2014. All products shipped into the marketplace after December 31, 2010 must comply with the new groove specification. Existing rules and any new rules could change the golf products industrys ability to innovate and deploy new technologies, as well as impact the competitive dynamic among industry participants, potentially impacting our Golf business. 39 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales decreased $36.5 million, or 3%, to $1,368.9 million. The sales decrease was primarily due to soft demand in the U.S., including the impact of lower consumer demand for discretionary purchases such as golf clubs, and the impact of a reduction in inventory by retailers. Net sales benefited from higher constant currency sales in Asian markets ($38 million), favorable foreign exchange ($17 million), and favorable mix ($17 million) as a result of new product introductions and sales of higher margin golf clubs. Operating income decreased $40.2 million, or 24%, to $125.3 million, primarily due to an increase in brand investment to support growth initiatives, lower sales and resulting adverse operating leverage, higher patent license expense, and increased commodity costs. Corporate 2009 Compared to 2008 Corporate expenses of $91.5 million, which include salaries, benefits and expenses related to corporate office services and employees, increased $33.7 million primarily due to an unfavorable comparison to a low level of incentive compensation in 2008, pension settlement costs, and expenses associated with the disposition of fixed assets. 2008 Compared to 2007 Corporate expenses of $57.8 million, which include salaries, benefits and expenses related to corporate office services and employees, decreased $1.1 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES While the global credit crisis abated during the course of 2009, general economic conditions remained challenging and volatility in capital and credit markets continued. We believe; however, that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations. Liquidity and Capitalization Our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, service indebtedness and pay dividends, as well as finance acquisitions and share repurchases when deemed appropriate. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and availability under our credit agreements. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries, domestic or foreign, to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate strategic options to increase shareholder value. While the current focus of our cash flow is paying down debt, we cannot predict whether or when we may enter into an acquisition, disposition, joint venture or other strategic options, or what impact any such transaction could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. On April 28, 2009, we announced a reduction in the indicative annual dividend rate on our common stock from $1.76 per share to $0.76 per share to align our dividend with our historical payout ratio range. We believe that this was a prudent course of action in the current environment and is in the best long term interest of our stockholders. This change in dividend rate decreased cash required for dividend payments by $109 million in 2009 and $150 million on an annual basis. We currently expect to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, but such payments are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors, including those set forth in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors. 40 Table of Contents We currently have an investment grade credit rating from three credit rating agencies. A downgrade of our credit ratings to non investment grade will modestly increase interest rates on some of our existing corporate debt as well as increase the interest rate on any new debt. In addition, it may impact our access to long term capital markets and weaken operating cash flow and liquidity, potentially impacting our ability to pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase shares in the future. Total debt decreased $260.6 million during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2009 to $4.5 billion. The ratio of total debt to total capital decreased to 46.7% at December 31, 2009 from 50.1% at December 31, 2008, primarily due to our use of cash flow to pay down debt, as well as higher equity due to net income in 2009 and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from foreign currency translation effects. On February 3, 2010, we executed a $750 million, 3 year committed revolving credit agreement to be used for general corporate purposes. This credit facility replaced our existing $2.0 billion, 5 year committed revolving credit agreement that had no balance outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The interest rates under this credit facility are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Companys long term credit rating. The credit facility includes a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio requirement of 3.0 to 1.0 through 2011 and 3.5 to 1.0 in 2012. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, as well as noncash restructuring and nonrecurring charges, losses from asset impairments, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of assets not in the ordinary course of business. Consolidated Interest Expense is as disclosed in the financial statements. The credit facility also includes a maximum debt to total capital ratio of 0.55 to 1.0. total capital is defined as debt plus equity including deferred taxes. Equity excludes any future impairment charges. If these covenants were in existence, at December 31, 2009 and 2008, we would have complied with these ratios by a wide margin. We believe the possibility of violating these covenants is remote. No other debt instruments include financial ratio covenants. We believe that our committed unused credit facility provides sufficient liquidity to fund our current operating and financing needs. We believe our credit facility was arranged with a strong and diversified group of financial institutions. In June 2009, we issued long term debt securities of $500 million under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 6 3/8% Notes will mature in June 2014. Proceeds were used to pay down balances on our revolving credit facility. Net proceeds of $496.7 million are less price discounts of $0.3 million and underwriting fees of $3.0 million. In November 2009, we issued long term debt securities of $400 million under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 3% Notes mature in June 2012. Proceeds were used to extinguish our three year term loan. Net proceeds of $398.4 million are less price discounts of $0.4 million and underwriting fees of $1.2 million. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $866.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 compared to $817.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. The increase in cash provided of $48.7 million was principally due to lower working capital due to the decrease in sales and working capital improvement initiatives across our businesses. 41 Table of Contents Net cash used for investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $213.2 million, compared to $274.2 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in cash used of $61.0 million was primarily due to the return of our investment from Maxxium ($58.4 million), and lower capital spending ($18.8 million), partly offset by higher spending for acquisitions ($16.5 million). The total cost of acquisitions in 2009 ($121.9 million) primarily consisted of approximately $66.2 million to purchase 100% interest in seven subsidiaries of Maxxium (our former international spirits sales and distribution joint venture), approximately $41.7 million to acquire 50% ownership in five other Maxxium joint venture entities, and the acquisition of EFFEN vodka. This compares to 2008s cost of acquisitions of $105.4 million, of which $103.2 million related to the acquisition of Cruzan rum. Net cash used by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $432.3 million, compared with $555.8 million in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2008. The decrease of $123.5 million was primarily due to the absence of the 2008 redemption of the 10% noncontrolling interest in the Spirits business ($455.0 million) and 2008 share repurchases ($278.6 million), as well as lower dividends ($109.0 million), partly offset by higher repayments of debt ($674.6 million, net of issuance of debt). Dividends A summary of 2009 dividend activity for the Companys common stock is shown below: Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date $0.44 per share January 28, 2009 February 11, 2009 March 2, 2009 $0.19 per share April 27, 2009 May 13, 2009 June 1, 2009 $0.19 per share July 28, 2009 August 12, 2009 September 1, 2009 $0.19 per share October 1, 2009 November 4, 2009 December 1, 2009 A summary of 2009 dividend activity for the Companys $2.67 Convertible Preferred stock is shown below: Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date $0.6675 per share January 28, 2009 February 11, 2009 March 10, 2009 $0.6675 per share April 27, 2009 May 13, 2009 June 10, 2009 $0.6675 per share July 28, 2009 August 12, 2009 September 10, 2009 $0.6675 per share October 1, 2009 November 4, 2009 December 10, 2009 Adequacy of Liquidity Sources Given the uncertainty of global economic conditions and volatility in financial markets, we are focused on liquidity and capital preservation. We will continue to assess economic conditions as we evaluate funding of potential acquisitions, share repurchases and our dividend policy. We believe that our internally generated funds, together with access to global credit markets, are adequate to meet our long term and short term capital needs. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Customer Credit Risk We routinely grant unsecured credit to customers in the normal course of business. Accounts receivables were $949.0 million as of December 31, 2009 and are recorded at their stated amount 42 Table of Contents less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. Allowances for doubtful accounts include provisions for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general formula basis when it is determined that some default is probable and estimable but not yet clearly associated with a specific customer. The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with our policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns was $72.0 million and $57.5 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The current conditions in the global economy and credit markets may reduce our customers ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and make our estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain. While we believe current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that continued weak economic conditions may cause significantly higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods. Counterparty Risk The counterparties to derivative contracts are major financial institutions. Although our theoretical risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments, we believe that the risk of incurring losses is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would be immaterial. The fair value of derivative assets at December 31, 2009 was $19.9 million. The estimated fair value of derivative contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. Pension Plans We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that are partially funded by a portfolio of investments maintained within benefit plan trusts. Total pension plan cash contributions were $26.4 million and $114.5 million, respectively, in 2009 and 2008. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet the minimum funding required by the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of our total pension plan assets was $821.7 million, representing 82% of the accumulated benefit obligation liability. On February 3, 2010, we made a voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans of 1.56 million shares of our common stock, held as treasury stock, with a fair value of $67.9 million. Foreign Exchange We have investments in various foreign countries, principally Australia, Canada, Mexico, Spain, the U.K. and France. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our balance sheet and cash flow statements when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, in 2006 we issued euro denominated long term debt. See Note 7, Debt and Financing Arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Interest Rates We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $400 million. In the second quarter of 2009, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $500 million. Interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2009 had a notional value totaling $900 million. These swap agreements hedge changes in the fair value of a portion of our existing fixed rate debt that result from changes in a benchmark interest rate (U.S. LIBOR). The swap agreements were designated and classified as fair value hedges in accordance with the authoritative 43 Table of Contents guidance on derivatives and hedging (ASC 815). In the second quarter of 2008, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $400 million. In October 2008, we terminated and settled the 2008 interest rate swap agreements and recorded a $15.6 million gain that is being amortized to income as reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and there were no interest rate swaps outstanding during 2007. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is impacted by interest rate risk and credit risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our $4,413.3 million and $4,693.6 million total long term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $4,433.0 million and $4,383.6 million, respectively. The fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. Guarantees and Commitments As of March 31, 2009, we terminated our guarantees related to the debt of Maxxium, our Spirits businesss former international sales and distribution joint venture. Since April 1, 2009, we have been providing similar guarantees of 50% of the credit facilities of Maxxium Espa&ntilde;a S.L., which expire in less than two years, in the amount of 11 million (approximately $15.7 million), reflecting our ownership in the joint venture with TEG. As of December 31, 2009, 6.5 million (approximately $9.3 million) was outstanding. The liability related to these guarantees was not material. BGSW and TEG have also executed an uncommitted multi currency Shareholder Loan Facility in the amount of 30 million (approximately $42.9 million) for BGSW/TEG joint ventures, of which our share is 50%. Our share of the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2009 was &pound;5 million (approximately $8.1 million). We also guaranteed various leases for ACCO World Corporation, the Office business divested in a spin off in 2005. We will continue to guarantee payment of certain real estate leases, with lease payments totaling approximately $22.6 million, through April 2013. As a result, we have recorded the fair value of these guarantees on our financial statements. The liability related to this guarantee was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2009. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table and discussion represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2009. (In millions) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2009 Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After5 years Short term borrowings $ 51.3 $ 51.3 $ $ $ Long term debt 4,413.3 1,146.4 1,532.5 1,734.4 Operating leases 193.3 56.0 78.0 44.3 15.0 Interest payments on long term debt 1,711.1 227.7 391.2 294.7 797.5 Purchase obligations(a) 827.5 356.7 178.6 127.2 165.0 Pension and postretirement contributions(b) 18.1 18.1 (a) Purchase obligations include: contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; advertising, selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures. (b) Minimum required pension and postretirement contributions cannot be determined beyond 2010. 44 Table of Contents Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, $460.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009 have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above. See Note 15, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. In addition to the contractual obligations and guarantees and commitments listed and described above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2009. Other corporate commercial commitments include Standby Letters of Credit of $83.0 million, of which $46.2 million expires in less than one year with the remaining $36.8 million expiring in one to three years; and Surety Bonds of $30.3 million all of which expires in less than one year. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. Derivative Financial Instruments In accordance with authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging (ASC 815), all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the statement of income when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Derivative gains or losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2009, deferred currency gains of $22.0 million were reclassified to earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2008, $3.9 million in deferred currency gains were reclassified to earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2007, $15.4 million in deferred currency losses were reclassified to earnings. Based on the foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2009, we estimate that $10.5 million of currency derivative losses included in OCI as of December 31, 2009 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. Foreign Currency Risk Certain forecasted transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged include the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of our euro denominated debt. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Interest Rate Risk We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. We also may, from time to time, enter into treasury rate locks and interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with fluctuation in interest rates related to anticipated issuances of new long term debt. See Note 8, Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K, for more information about the management of our interest rate risk. 45 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Codification In July 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The ASC supersedes all existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards and is not intended to change GAAP. The use of the ASC was effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after September 15, 2009. Transfer of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB amended the existing authoritative guidance on transfer of financial assets (ASC 860). The new guidance a) eliminates of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity, b) clarifies and changes derecognition criteria for a transfer, and c) enhances disclosure of risks for which a transferor retains exposure due to continuing involvement in transferred financial assets. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 (calendar year 2010 for Fortune Brands). If in effect in calendar year 2009, ASC 860 would have had no current impact on our financial statements or disclosure. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB amended the existing authoritative guidance on variable interest entities (ASC 810). This new authoritative guidance a) includes a new approach for determining when a variable interest entity (VIE) should be consolidated and b) changes when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE. The new approach requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary (consolidator). The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 (calendar year 2010 for Fortune Brands). We do not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures. Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. This guidance allows entities to allocate consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that reflects a transactions economics. The guidance requires expanded disclosure. It is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (calendar year 2011 for Fortune Brands) and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We do not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the following are the Companys critical accounting policies due to the more significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our assumptions and estimates. 46 Table of Contents Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers potential insolvency), or discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns for continuing operations was $72.0 million and $57.5 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Inventories The first in, first out inventory method is our principal inventory method across all segments. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice, maturing spirits inventories are classified as current assets, although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one year due to the duration of aging processes. Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost of market value for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory turns, product spoilage and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes. Long lived Assets In accordance with authoritative guidance on property, plant, and equipment (ASC 360), a long lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is estimated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows on a market participant basis. Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangible Assets In accordance with authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangibles assets (ASC 350), goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is required if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates, and then discount the future cash flows at a market participant derived weighted average cost of capital. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income based on managements plans for that business; business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions; and market participant considerations. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or in the case of the Home & Security segment, one level below the operating segment. When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying 47 Table of Contents value, we measure and recognize the amount of the goodwill impairment loss, if any. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is estimated based on a hypothetical allocation of each reporting units fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of ASC 350. ASC 350 requires that purchased intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impairment of that intangible. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. We measure fair value using the standard relief from royalty approach which estimates the present value of royalty income that could hypothetically earned by licensing the brand name to a third party over the remaining useful life. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, the impact of the economic environment; a material negative change in relationships with significant customers; or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement, post employment and health care benefits. We record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current economic conditions and trends. We use a market related value method of plan assets to calculate pension costs, recognizing each years asset gains or losses over a five year period. Compensation increases reflect expected future compensation trends. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a spot rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans investments and our expectations for long term rates of return. The bond portfolio used for the selection of the interest rates is from the top quartile of bonds rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and includes only non callable bonds and those that are deemed to be sufficiently marketable with a Moodys credit rating of Aa or higher. The weighted average discount rate for pension and postretirement benefit liabilities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 5.9% and 6.5%, respectively. As required by U.S. GAAP, the effects of actuarial deviations from assumptions are generally accumulated and, if over a specified corridor, amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees. The weighted average remaining service period for the pension plans at December 31, 2009 was approximately 10.4 years. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the related employees. The total net actuarial losses for all pension and postretirement benefit plans were $429 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $18 million from December 31, 2008, primarily as a 48 Table of Contents result of amortization of loss recognition in pension expense ($12 million) and recognition of curtailments and settlements ($15 million), partly offset by net actuarial losses in 2009 ($9 million). We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the Companys plans are reasonable based on our experience and on advice from our independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For postretirement benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on historical cost increases and expectations for long term increases. As of December 31, 2009, for postretirement medical and prescription drugs, our assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 7.5% in the next year, declining 50 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. Our assumption as of December 31, 2008, for postretirement medical, was an assumed rate of increase of 6.75% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year, and, for postretirement prescription drugs, an assumed rate of increase of 9.75% in the next year, declining 75 basis points a year until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. Pension expenses were $48.9 million, $32.5 million, $41.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, including net curtailment and settlement losses of $17.6 million, $2.8 million, and zero for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Postretirement expenses were $7.9 million, $8.8 million and $9.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, including net curtailment gains of $0.1 million, $2.6 million, and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A 25 basis point change in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension expense and postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for 2009. A 25 basis point change in the long term rate of return on plan assets used in accounting for the Companys pension plans would have a $2.4 million impact on pension expense. Income Taxes In accordance with authoritative guidance on income taxes (ASC 740), we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. We do not provide deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to permanently reinvest or on foreign subsidiary earnings that will be remitted without incremental taxes. We record liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, zero tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded. The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the Companys estimates. In future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require the Company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling $460.5 million. It is reasonably possible the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $85 to $140 million in the next 12 months primarily as a result of the conclusion of U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings. 49 Table of Contents Customer Program Costs Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in many of our businesses. These businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sell through of that businesss products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume allowances, are generally accounted for in either net sales or the category advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses at the time the program is initiated and or the revenue is recognized. The costs recognized in net sales include, but are not limited to, general customer program generated expenses, cooperative advertising programs, volume allowances and promotional allowances. The costs typically recognized in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses include point of sale materials and shared media. These costs are recorded at the latter of the time of sale or the implementation of the program based on managements best estimates. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Volume allowances are accrued based on managements estimates of customer volume achievement and other factors incorporated into customer agreements, such as new product purchases, store sell through, merchandising support, levels of returns and customer training. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). Cost Initiatives We continuously evaluate the productivity of our supply chains and existing asset base, and actively seek to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure. Future opportunities may involve, among other things, the reorganization of operations, the relocation of manufacturing or assembly to locations generally having lower costs and the efficient sourcing of products or components from third party suppliers. Implementing any significant cost reduction and efficiency opportunities could result in charges. Pending Litigation See Note 24, Pending Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 to this Form 10 K. Environmental Matters We are involved in numerous remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. As of February 1, 2010, several of our subsidiaries had been designated as potentially responsible parties (PRP) under Superfund or similar state laws in 51 instances. Of these instances, 37 have been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In calendar year 2009, we were identified as a PRP in one new instance, and six PRP claims were dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. The average settlement was approximately $7,333. In most instances where we are named as a PRP, we enter into cost sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other responsible parties or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had accruals of $24.5 million and $29.1 million, respectively, to cover environmental compliance and clean up including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites. 50 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The counterparties are major financial institutions. Interest Rate Risk The disclosure about interest rate risk required to be provided under this item is set forth under Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rates and is incorporated herein by reference. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Companys variable rate borrowings would impact pre tax interest expense by $9.9 million. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions. We periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. As indicated in the analysis that follows, the estimated potential loss under foreign exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on current results of operations or financial condition. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value at risk (VAR) computation to estimate the potential economic loss that we could incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The VAR estimations are intended to measure the maximum amount of our loss from foreign exchange contracts due to adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates, given a specified confidence level, over a given period of time. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques. Also, the use of the VAR model should not be construed as an endorsement of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The following table summarizes our estimated loss under the VAR model as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the VAR results from more foreign exchanges contracts and greater volatility in the foreign exchange markets. (In millions) Estimated Amount of Loss Period ConfidenceLevel 2009 foreign exchange $ 5.5 1 day 95% 2008 foreign exchange $ 7.2 1 day 95% The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange contracts would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR 51 Table of Contents model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to commodity price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. From time to time, we use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility. 52 Table of Contents
