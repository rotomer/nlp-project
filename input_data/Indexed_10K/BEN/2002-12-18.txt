ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS In this section, we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition. We also make some statements relating to the future which are called "forward looking statements." Although we do our best to make clear and accurate forward looking statements, the actual results and outcomes could differ significantly from those that we discuss in this document. For this reason, you should not rely too heavily on these forward looking statements and should review the "Risk Factors" section, where we discuss these statements in more detail. GENERAL We derive the majority of our operating revenues, operating expenses and net income from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds, institutional, high net worth and private accounts, and other investment products. This is our main business activity and operating segment. The mutual funds and other products that we advise, collectively called our sponsored investment products, are distributed to the public globally via five distinct names: * Franklin * Templeton * Mutual Series * Fiduciary Trust * Bissett Our sponsored investment products include a broad range of domestic and global/international equity, hybrid, fixed income and money market mutual funds, as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management. To a lesser degree, our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. Our secondary business and operating segment is banking/finance. Our banking/finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals, foundations and institutions and consumer lending. At September 30, 2002, we employed approximately 6,700 people in 28 countries serving customers on six different continents. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three fiscal years. 2002 2001 (in millions except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 vs 2001 vs 2000 NET INCOME $432.7 $484.7 $562.1 (11)% (14)% EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Basic $1.66 $1.92 $2.28 (14)% (16)% Diluted $1.65 $1.91 $2.28 (14)% (16)% OPERATING MARGIN 23% 22% 28% EBITDA MARGIN /1/ 30% 33% 36% /1/ EBITDA margin is earnings before interest, taxes on income, depreciation and the amortization of intangibles divided by total revenues. The effect of the September 2002 $60.1 million other than temporary decline in investments value is excluded from EBITDA. Our September 2002 EBITDA margin, including other than temporary decline in investments value, is 28%. Net income decreased by 11% and diluted earnings per share decreased by 14% in fiscal 2002 mainly due to lower investment and other income related to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments and increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. Net income decreased by 25 14% and diluted earnings per share decreased by 16% in fiscal 2001, mainly due to increased operating expenses offset by slightly higher revenue and investment income. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (in billions) 2002 2001 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 2001 2000 vs 2001 vs 2000 EQUITY Global/international $76.5 $80.2 $97.6 (5)% (18)% Domestic (U.S.) 41.4 44.5 53.9 (7)% (17)% TOTAL EQUITY 117.9 124.7 151.5 (5)% (18)% HYBRID 36.6 36.1 9.3 1% 288% FIXED INCOME Tax free 52.8 48.4 44.0 9% 10% Taxable Domestic (U.S.) 26.1 24.4 15.6 7% 56% Global/international 8.6 7.2 4.2 19% 71% TOTAL FIXED INCOME 87.5 80.0 63.8 9% 25% MONEY 5.8 5.6 5.3 4% 6% TOTAL $247.8 $246.4 $229.9 1% 7% Simple monthly average for the year /2/ $263.2 $243.4 $227.7 8% 7% /2/ Investment management fees from approximately 50% of our assets under management at September 30, 2002 are calculated using daily average assets under management. Our assets under management at September 30, 2002 were $247.8 billion, 1% higher than a year ago. The simple monthly average value of these assets during fiscal 2002 was $263.2 billion as compared to $243.4 billion in fiscal 2001, an 8% increase. The year over year change in simple monthly average assets under management generally is more indicative of investment management fee revenue trends than the year over year change in year end assets. The mix of assets under management is shown below, followed by industry data showing average effective investment management fees using data from Lipper(R) Inc. Our actual effective fee rates may vary from these rates. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 2001 2000 PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT Equity 48% 51% 66% Fixed income 35% 32% 28% Hybrid 15% 15% 4% Money 2% 2% 2% Total 100% 100% 100% 26 EQUITY HYBRID FIXED INCOME MONEY TAXABLE TAXABLE GLOBAL/ DOMESTIC TAX DOMESTIC GLOBAL/ INTERNATIONAL (U.S.) FREE (U.S.) INTERNATIONAL Industry effective investment management fee rates as of September 30, 2002 /3/ 0.71% 0.55% 0.45% 0.43% 0.43% 0.59% 0.27% /3/ Calculated by Franklin Templeton Investments based on asset weighted averages of management fee rates provided by Lipper(R) Inc. Industry effective investment management fee rates are calculated using all U.S. based, open ended funds that reported expense data to Lipper(R) Inc. as of the funds most recent annual report date, and for which management fee rates were greater or equal to zero. Industry effective fee rates reflect the investment management expenses of retail and institutional funds drawn from all distribution channels, without exception. The averages reflect combined retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes, and all distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuities are not included. The change in the mix of assets under management was largely due to the inclusion of the assets under management of Fiduciary Trust Company International ("Fiduciary") beginning in fiscal 2001 and the market depreciation in equity assets in 2002 and 2001. Approximately 64% of Fiduciarys assets under management were classified as hybrid assets at the time of acquisition in April 2001. This change in mix lowered our overall effective fee rate on assets managed, as a greater percentage of assets under management are in the fixed income and hybrid categories which generally carry a lower management fee than equity assets. The effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management) declined to 0.56% for the 2002 fiscal year compared to 0.58% in fiscal 2001 and 0.61% in fiscal 2000. At September 30, 2002 assets under management by shareholder location were as follows: UNITED ASIA/PACIFIC (in billions) STATES CANADA EUROPE AND OTHER TOTAL Assets Under Management $209.4 $17.3 $9.6 $11.5 $247.8 Investors in the United States own approximately 85% of our assets under management and approximately 73% of our revenues originate in the United States. Investment advisory and administrative services related to these assets may be provided in jurisdictions outside the United States in accordance with contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products. The components of the change in our assets under management were as follows: (in billions) 2002 2001 YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 2001 2000 vs 2001 vs 2000 Beginning assets under management $246.4 $229.9 $218.1 7% 5% Sales 72.4 58.5 51.7 24% 13% Reinvested dividends 4.8 9.0 8.7 (47)% 3% Redemptions (57.5) (58.6) (62.8) (2)% (7)% Acquisitions 0.8 49.5 1.5 (98)% 3,200% (Depreciation) appreciation (19.1) (41.9) 12.7 (54)% N/A Ending assets under management $247.8 $246.4 $229.9 1% 7% During fiscal 2002 and 2001, our sponsored investment products experienced overall net cash inflows, including reinvested dividends, in contrast to the net cash outflows experienced in fiscal 2000. Gross product sales increased 24% while redemptions decreased 2% in 2002. Our acquisition of Pioneer ITI AMC Limited ("Pioneer"), an Indian investment management company, in July 2002 increased our assets under management by $0.8 billion as of the date of this acquisition. In 2001, the acquisition of Bissett in 27 October 2000 increased our assets under management by $3.7 billion, and the Fiduciary acquisition in April 2001 increased our assets under management by $45.8 billion, as of the dates of those acquisitions. Despite an overall decline in domestic and global equity markets in the latter half of 2002, our assets under management increased from fiscal 2001 primarily as a result of strong net sales during the year and less depreciation than in 2001. In fiscal 2001, assets under management increased mainly due to the Fiduciary and Bissett acquisitions and net inflows, partially offset by depreciation. OPERATING REVENUES The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category between fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and between fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. 2002 2001 AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES vs 2001 vs 2000 2002 2001 2000 Investment management fees 4% 1% 58% 60% 60% Underwriting and distribution fees 12% 31% 30% 30% Shareholder servicing fees (4)% (6)% 8% 8% 9% Other, net 86% 90% 3% 2% 1% TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES 7% 1% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY In fiscal 2002, total operating revenues increased 7% over the prior year. Investment management and underwriting and distribution fees increased due to both higher net sales and higher average assets under management. We also benefited from the inclusion of Fiduciary revenues for a full fiscal year in 2002, as well as higher net gains related to auto loan securitizations included in Other, net revenue. In fiscal 2001, total operating revenues increased 1%. The acquisition of Fiduciary in April 2001 provided higher investment management fees from higher average assets under management. We also experienced higher banking revenues included in other, net offset by reduced shareholder servicing fees. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES Investment management fees, accounting for 58% of our operating revenues in fiscal 2002, include both investment advisory and administration fees. These fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. In return for these fees, we provide a combination of investment advisory, administrative and other management services. Investment management fees increased 4% in fiscal 2002 mainly due to increased net sales, which increased assets under management, and the impact of including Fiduciary for a full fiscal year. This increase was partially offset by a shift in our asset mix toward fixed income investment products, which led to a decrease in our effective investment management fee rate. Investment management fees increased 1% in fiscal 2001 from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the Fiduciary acquisition, which increased the simple monthly average assets under management in the latter half of the year, partially offset by a shift in our asset mix toward fixed income and hybrid investment products, which carry lower effective fee rates. UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION FEES We earn underwriting fees from the sale of some classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase. Sales at reduced or zero commissions are offered on some classes of shares and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum 28 amounts. Therefore, underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales and the relative mix of sales between different share classes. Our sponsored investment products pay distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. While other contractual arrangements exist in international jurisdictions, in the United States, distribution fees include 12b 1 fees. These fees are subject to maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund. We pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisors and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf. See the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below. Overall, underwriting and distribution fees increased 12% in fiscal 2002. Underwriting fees increased 24% consistent with a 24% increase in gross product sales and distribution fees increased 5% consistent with an 8% increase in simple monthly average assets under management. Underwriting and distribution fees remained constant in fiscal 2001 as an overall increase in product sales was offset by a greater percentage of overall sales being made at no or lower commission levels. Distribution fees also remained constant as the increase in average assets under management was related to the Fiduciary acquisition. The Fiduciary assets under management are not subject to distribution fees; therefore, these assets did not affect distribution fee income as would be expected with a year over year increase in average assets under management. SHAREHOLDER SERVICING FEES Shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some instances, sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management. We receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. In the United States, transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in the previous calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Shareholder servicing fees decreased 4% in fiscal 2002 and 6% in fiscal 2001 consistent with a decrease in the quarterly average number of billable accounts. Our acquisition of Pioneer added approximately 0.7 million shareholder accounts. OTHER, NET Other, net consists mainly of revenues from the banking/finance operating segment and Fiduciarys custody services. Revenues from the banking/finance operating segment include interest income on loans, servicing income, and investment income on banking/finance investment securities, which are offset by interest expense and the provision for anticipated loan losses. Other, net increased 86% in fiscal 2002. This increase was mainly due to the inclusion of Fiduciarys banking and custody activities for a full fiscal year in 2002 and increased gains recognized on auto loan portfolio sales. Other, net increased 90% in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to the addition of the Fiduciary banking and custody activities from the date of acquisition of Fiduciary to those of Franklin Bank and Trust, F.S.B., and Franklin Capital Corporation. 29 OPERATING EXPENSES 2002 2001 AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL EXPENSES vs 2001 vs 2000 2002 2001 2000 Underwriting and distribution 12% 2% 37% 35% 37% Compensation and benefits 5% 15% 33% 33% 32% Information systems, technology and occupancy 12% 23% 15% 14% 13% Advertising and promotion 1% 5% 6% 6% 6% Amortization of deferred sales commissions (2)% (18)% 3% 4% 5% Amortization of intangible assets (70)% 52% 1% 3% 2% Other (2)% 7% 5% 5% 5% September 11, 2001 expense, net (100)% 100% 0% 0% N/A Total operating expenses 5% 10% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY Operating expenses increased 5% during fiscal 2002. This increase was mainly due to increased underwriting and distribution fees consistent with higher underwriting and distribution revenue, and higher compensation and benefits and technology and occupancy costs primarily due to the inclusion of Fiduciarys activity for a full fiscal year in 2002. The increase in these expense categories was offset in part by a decline in amortization of intangible assets on discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In fiscal 2001, operating expenses increased 10% mainly caused by increased compensation and benefits, information systems, technology and occupancy costs, the addition of the operating costs of Fiduciary, increased underwriting and distribution expenses and increased amortization of intangible assets. UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION Underwriting and distribution includes expenses paid to financial advisers and other third parties for selling, distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products. Underwriting and distribution expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2002 and 2% in fiscal 2001 consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS Compensation and benefits increased 5% during fiscal 2002 due mainly to the inclusion of Fiduciarys activity for a full fiscal year, including retention bonuses committed to the Fiduciary staff. This increase was partially offset by an overall decline in employees as well as the decision made by management during the quarter ended December 2001 to reduce employee salaries by 5% or 10%, depending on specific salary categories. In May 2002, we reinstated salaries for employees whose salaries were reduced by 5% and, in July 2002, we reinstated employee salaries in the 10% reduction category. We employed approximately 6,700 people at September 30, 2002 compared to approximately 6,900 at the same time last year. Our acquisition of Pioneer added approximately 180 employees. In order to hire and retain our key employees, we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive, which means that the level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenues. Compensation and benefits increased 15% during fiscal 2001. This increase was mainly due to the addition of approximately 790 Fiduciary employees from the date of acquisition, retention bonuses for Fiduciary employees, annual salary increases, and an increase in employee benefit and recruiting costs. 30 INFORMATION SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased 12% in fiscal 2002. This increase was mainly due to the inclusion of costs related to the outsourcing of the management of our data center and distributed server operations and added technology and occupancy costs of the Fiduciary acquisition for a full fiscal year in 2002. Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased 23% in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to continued expenditure on new technology initiatives, an investment in the technology infrastructure of the company, the charges and costs in connection with the outsourcing of the management of our data center and distributed server operations, and the added technology and occupancy costs of the Fiduciary acquisition. We also experienced an increase in occupancy costs related to our expansion in Asia, Canada, and Europe as well as costs related to the relocation to our new worldwide headquarters in San Mateo, California. Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs were as follows: (in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Net carrying amount at beginning of period $162,857 $156,895 $138,566 Additions during period, net of disposals and other adjustments 35,570 69,794 71,884 Net assets purchased through acquisitions 206 11,266 Amortization during period (77,147) (75,098) (53,555) Net carrying amount at end of period $121,486 $162,857 $156,895 Information systems and technology costs capitalized in fiscal 2002 were less than amounts capitalized in fiscal 2001 as we slowed down a number of initiatives, realized synergies from previous investments in technology and delayed the start of other technology projects given the current economic slowdown and our focus on cost control and management. ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION Advertising and promotion increased 1% during fiscal 2002 and 5% in fiscal 2001. Increases in both years resulted mainly from increased promotion and advertising activity to educate the sales channels and the investing public about the strong relative investment performance of our sponsored investment products. AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS Certain fund share classes, including class B, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders, while at the same time, our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale. In the United States, class A shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met while our U.S. distribution subsidiary pays a commission on such sales. Class C shares are sold with a front end sales charge that is lower than the commission paid by the U.S. distributor. We defer and amortize all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries. We have arranged to finance certain of these deferred commission assets ("DCA") arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations through Lightning Finance Company Limited ("LFL"), a company in which we have an ownership interest. In the United States, LFL has entered into a financing agreement with our U.S. distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the assets until resold by LFL. As a result, we retain DCA sold to LFL under the U.S. agreement in our financial statements and amortize them over an 8 year period until resold by LFL in a securitization, which generally occurs at least once annually. LFL sold approximately $61.5 million U.S. DCA in fiscal 2002 and approximately $20.3 million U.S. DCA in fiscal 2001 in securitization transactions. In contrast to the U.S. arrangement, LFL has entered into direct agreements with the Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and, as a result, we do not record DCA from these sources in our financial statements. 31 Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 2% in fiscal 2002 and 18% in fiscal 2001. These changes were mainly a result of changes in sales mix and our current financing arrangements. As the balance of DCA on our balance sheet changes, so does the amortization expense. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS Amortization of intangible assets decreased 70% in fiscal 2002. This decrease was due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), on October 1, 2001. Under the new accounting standard, we ceased to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. This resulted in a reduction in amortization expense of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2002 as compared to the prior year. We completed our impairment testing as specified in SFAS 142 in March 2002 and we determined that there was no impairment to the goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded in our financial statements as of October 1, 2001. Amortization of intangible assets increased 52% in fiscal 2001, due to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the purchase of Bissett and Fiduciary. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) includes investment and other income and interest expense. Investment and other income is comprised primarily of the following: * dividends from investments * interest income from investments in bonds and government securities * realized gains and losses on investments * foreign currency exchange gains and losses * miscellaneous income, including gain or loss on disposal of property. Other income (expense) was a net expense in fiscal 2002 mainly due to a $60.1 million other than temporary decline in value of some of our investments recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. In contrast, in fiscal 2001, we recognized net realized gains of approximately $34.2 million on the sale of certain sponsored investment products held for investment purposes and other realized gains of $24.6 million related to the sale of our former headquarters building in San Mateo. Other income (expense) increased 65% in fiscal 2001 from the prior year, primarily due to net realized gains related to our sponsored investment products and the sale of our former headquarters building in San Mateo. TAXES ON INCOME Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2002 increased to 25% compared to 24% in fiscal 2001 and 2000. As a multi national corporation, we provide investment management services to a wide range of international investment products, often managed from locations outside the United States. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the United States. The mix of income (primarily investment management fees) subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the United States, produces a lower overall effective tax rate than existing U.S. Federal and state tax rates. The effective tax rate will continue to be reflective of the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At September 30, 2002, we had $980.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $596.2 million at September 30, 2001. Cash and cash equivalents include cash, U.S. Treasury bills and other debt instruments with original maturities of three month or less and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash, including money market funds. The mix of short term instruments and, in particular, the maturity schedules of some debt instruments, affect the level reported in cash and cash equivalents and in investments, available for sale in any given year. Liquid assets, which consist of cash and 32 cash equivalents, investments available for sale and current receivables increased to $2,826.0 million at September 30, 2002 from $2,273.1 million at September 30, 2001. At September 30, 2002, approximately $850 million was available to us under unused commercial paper and medium term note programs. In addition, in fiscal 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission permitting the issuance of debt and equity securities of up to $300 million. Our committed revolving credit facilities at September 30, 2002 totaled $420 million, of which, $210 million was under a 364 day facility. The remaining $210 million facility is under a five year facility and will expire in June 2007. In addition, our Fiduciary subsidiary has $350 million available in uncommitted bank lines under the Federal Reserve Funds system. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the equity market valuation levels. In extreme circumstances, we might not be able to access this liquidity readily. Outstanding debt increased to $603.0 million at September 30, 2002 compared to $574.4 million at September 30, 2001. As of September 30, 2002 outstanding debt consists of $514.2 million in principal and accrued interest related to outstanding convertible notes that we issued in May 2001 and $88.8 million of other long term debt. As of September 30, 2001, outstanding debt included $504.7 million related to the convertible notes and $69.7 million of other long term debt. Each of the $1,000 (principal amount at maturity) convertible notes is convertible into 9.3604 shares of our common stock. We may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after May 11, 2006 at their accreted value. We may have to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value, at the option of the holders, on May 11 of 2003, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 and 2026. In this event, we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock. The amount of convertible notes that will be redeemed depends on, among other factors, the performance of our common stock. Other long term debt consists primarily of deferred commission liability recognized in relation to the U.S. DCA financed by LFL that has not yet been sold by LFL in a securitization transaction. The increase in outstanding debt in fiscal 2002 is due to additional financing activity of our mutual fund Class B shares sales and the accretion of the convertible notes to maturity, partially offset by an increase in DCA sold by LFL. We have arranged with LFL for non recourse financing of sales commissions advanced on sales of our B and C shares globally. The sales commissions that we have financed through LFL during fiscal 2002 were approximately $135.3 million compared to $84.7 million in fiscal 2001. Since September 1998, our banking/finance operating segment has entered into a number of auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors. The outstanding loan balances held by these special purpose entities were $530.9 million as of September 30, 2002 and $210.8 million as of September 30, 2001. Our ability to access the securitization market will directly affect our plans to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future. We expect that the main uses of cash will be to: * expand our core business * make strategic acquisitions * acquire shares of our common stock * fund property and equipment purchases * pay operating expenses of the business * enhance our technology infrastructure * improve our business processes * pay shareholder dividends * repay and service debt. 33 We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through the following: * our existing liquid assets * the continuing cash flow from operations * our borrowing capacity under current credit facilities * our ability to issue debt or equity securities * our mutual fund sales commission financing arrangement. In particular, we expect to finance future investment in our banking/finance activities through operating cash flows, debt, increased deposit base, or through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As described in Note 11 to the financial statements, our largest commitment at September 30, 2002 relates to our convertible debt outstanding. In addition, at September 30, 2002, the banking/finance operating segment had commitments to extend credit aggregating $281.5 million, mainly under its credit card lines. Standby letters of credit issued to Fiduciary clients totaled $7.4 million and expire through December 2003. The standby letters of credit are secured by marketable securities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position. 34 In addition, please refer to Note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material impact on our financial statements. INTANGIBLE ASSETS At September 30, 2002 our assets included intangible assets as follows: (in thousands) NET CARRYING AMOUNT Goodwill $1,321,939 Intangible assets definite lived 221,942 Intangible assets indefinite lived 475,304 Total $2,019,185 Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment at least once a year. As of March 31, 2002, we completed the impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to the goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded in our books and records as of October 1, 2001. While we believe that our testing was appropriate, it involved the use of estimates and assumptions. Using different assumptions may have resulted in recognizing some impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in our financial statements. We are also required to consider if any impairment has occurred to definite lived intangible assets. Based on our review and evaluation, we do not believe any impairment has occurred. INCOME TAXES As a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the United States. We have made no provision for U.S. taxes on $1,894 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are intended to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time. Changes to our policy of reinvesting foreign earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operation. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS We record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Where available, we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information. However, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For example, we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold, and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value. We evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time. As most of our investments are carried at fair value, if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist, the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income, in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined. During fiscal 2002, we recognized $60.1 million for an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements. 35 LOSS CONTINGENCIES We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claim based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2002 to provide for any losses that may arise from these matters. SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES Special purpose entities ("SPEs") consist of corporations, trusts, partnerships and other entities that are established for a limited purpose. In the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has currently undertaken a project to address accounting for SPEs. We will continue to monitor the FASBs project to determine the effect, if any, it will have on our treatment of any of the SPEs described below. LIGHTNING FINANCE COMPANY LIMITED. We finance certain DCA arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations through LFL, a company in which we have an ownership interest. In the United States, LFL has entered into a financing agreement with our U.S. distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the assets until resold by LFL. As a result, we retain DCA sold under the U.S. agreement in our financial statements and amortize them over an 8 year period, until resold by LFL in a securitization. In contrast to the U.S. arrangement, LFL has entered into direct agreements with the Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and we do not record DCA from these sources in our financial statements. AUTO LOAN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. We have entered into auto loan securitization transactions with a number of qualified SPEs and have recorded these transactions as sales. In addition, we retained interest only strips receivable, representing our contractual right to receive interest and other cash flows from the pool of securitized loans after payment of required amounts to the holders of the securities and certain costs associated with the securitization. Interest only strips are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. LESSOR TRUST. We lease our corporate headquarters in San Mateo, California from a lessor trust under an operating lease that expires in fiscal 2005, with additional renewal options for a further period of up to 10 years. In connection with this lease, we are contingently liable for approximately $145 million in residual guarantees, representing approximately 85% of the total construction costs of $170 million. The lease agreement is not expected to impact our cash flows or financial condition materially during the initial five year lease period. The lease is treated as an operating lease, as none of the capitalization criteria under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.13, "Accounting for Leases", were met at the inception of the lease. COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS. We provide investment management services to, and have made investments in, a number of Collateralized Debt Obligation ("CDO") SPEs. These CDOs were established as a vehicle for our clients and invest mainly in debt instruments. Our ownership interest in the CDOs is not sufficient to meet consolidation requirements and they are reported at fair value as further described in Note 1 to the financial statements. 36 QUARTERLY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (in thousands except per share data) QUARTER FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH 2002 Revenues $618,207 $625,968 $666,050 $608,307 Operating income $142,865 $148,019 $153,852 $140,766 Net income $118,519 $119,996 $125,690 $68,518 Earnings per share: Basic $0.45 $0.46 $0.48 $0.26 Diluted $0.45 $0.46 $0.48 $0.26 Dividend per share $0.070 $0.070 $0.070 $0.070 Common stock price per share: High $37.85 $44.15 $44.48 $43.15 Low $30.85 $34.52 $39.45 $29.52 2001 Revenues $564,074 $577,413 $609,473 $603,883 Operating income $148,978 $144,473 $124,696 $93,848 Net income $149,465 $131,684 $119,703 $83,869 Earnings per share: Basic $0.61 $0.54 $0.46 $0.32 Diluted $0.61 $0.54 $0.46 $0.32 Dividend per share $0.065 $0.065 $0.065 $0.065 Common stock price per share: High $45.50 $48.30 $47.40 $46.07 Low $34.00 $34.20 $36.05 $31.65 2000 Revenues $565,667 $612,526 $568,897 $593,050 Operating income $167,635 $172,077 $168,832 $154,899 Net income $137,522 $143,374 $140,370 $140,823 Earnings per share: Basic $0.55 $0.58 $0.58 $0.58 Diluted $0.55 $0.58 $0.58 $0.58 Dividend per share $0.06 $0.06 $0.06 $0.06 Common stock price per share: High $35.00 $39.19 $36.25 $45.63 Low $27.44 $24.63 $28.19 $30.00 Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Pacific Exchange, Inc. under the ticker symbol BEN and the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FKR. On September 30, 2002, the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE was $31.10 per share. At December 3, 2002, there were approximately 5,100 shareholders of record. 37 RISK FACTORS "FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS". When used in this Annual Report, words or phrases about the future such as "expected to," "will continue," "anticipates," "estimates," or similar expressions are "forward looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements about our future cash needs, our anticipated uses of cash, the expected sources of future cash inflows, and the anticipated costs related to the September 11, 2001 tragedy, are also "forward looking statements." These types of statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as the factors described in the risk factors outlined below. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, and you should not rely on them. Rather, you should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk disclosures in this Annual Report. If a circumstance occurs that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate, we have no obligation to announce publicly the change in our expectations, or to revise the forward looking statements. WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS AND SOMETIMES LARGER COMPANIES. We compete with numerous investment management companies, stock brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions. Continuing consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own. Additionally, competing securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products, which could limit the distribution of our investment products. To the extent that existing or potential customers, including securities dealers, decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and net income could decline. CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS ON WHICH WE DEPEND COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND HINDER OUR GROWTH. We derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker/dealers and other similar investment advisors. Increasing competition for these distribution channels has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future. Higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings. Additionally, if one of the major financial advisors who distribute our products were to cease their operations, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings. Moreover, our failure to maintain strong business relationships with these advisors would impair our ability to distribute and sell our products, which would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management, related revenues and overall business and financial condition. WE HAVE BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASED RISK OF ASSET VOLATILITY FROM CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS. We have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets due to the continuing threat of terrorism and the recent reports of accounting irregularities at certain public companies. Declines in these markets have caused in the past, and would cause in the future, a decline in our revenue and income. THE LEVELS OF OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, WHICH IN TURN IMPACT REVENUES, ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. Global economic conditions, changes in the equity market place, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix, market values and levels of our assets under management. Changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income, since we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage. Similarly, our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation. WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN NUMEROUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. We sell mutual funds and offer investment advisory and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally. Regulators in these jurisdictions could change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets. 38 OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE WIDELY VARIED SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS CAN BE IMPEDED BY SYSTEMS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. Our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business globally depends on our ability to integrate the varied accounting, financial and operational systems of our international business with that of our domestic business. OUR INABILITY TO MEET CASH NEEDS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. Our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value, our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock. Similarly, our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables, and to obtain continued financing for Class B and C shares, is also subject to the markets perception of those assets, finance rates offered by competitors, and the general market for private debt. If we are unable to obtain these funds and financing, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans. WE FACE COMPETITION IN HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. Our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. If we are not able to attract and retain qualified employees, our overall business condition and revenues could suffer. OUR EMERGING MARKET PORTFOLIOS AND RELATED REVENUES ARE VULNERABLE TO MARKET SPECIFIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS. Our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental polices, expropriation, nationalization, asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership. Foreign trading markets, particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than the U.S. and other established markets. DIVERSE AND STRONG COMPETITION LIMITS THE INTEREST RATES THAT WE CAN CHARGE ON CONSUMER LOANS. We compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans, which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales. Our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business. Economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans, which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase. THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 WORLD TRADE CENTER TRAGEDY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS WE EXPECT FROM THE ACQUISITION OF FIDUCIARY. The September 11, 2001 tragedy at the World Trade Center resulted in the destruction of our Fiduciary headquarters, loss of 87 of our employees, additional operating expenses to re establish and relocate our operations, and asset write offs, all of which could adversely affect or delay our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition. Our insurance coverage may not cover all losses on claims for property, damage, extra expenses and business interruptions arising out of the destruction of the World Trade Center. For the next several years, insurance costs are likely to increase materially and we may not be able to obtain the same types or amounts of coverage. THE FIDUCIARY ACQUISITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMBINED FINANCIAL RESULTS OR THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. If the benefits of the acquisition over time do not exceed the costs associated with the acquisition, including any dilution to our shareholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition, our financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected. Revenue and cost synergies from the acquisition of Fiduciary may not be fully realized and may take longer to realize than originally anticipated. WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATION. Upon completion of our acquisition of Fiduciary, we became a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. We are subject to the restrictions, limitations, or prohibitions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. The Federal Reserve Board may impose additional limitations or restrictions on our activities, including if the Federal Reserve Board believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or 39 make an acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board may also take actions as appropriate to enforce applicable federal law. TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING RISK COULD CONSTRAIN OUR OPERATIONS. We are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology, operating systems and premises. Although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third party failures, which could negatively impact our operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk: the potential loss due to changes in the value of investments resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange and or equity prices. Management is responsible for managing this risk. Our Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks. We are exposed to changes in interest rates mainly through our debt transactions and portfolio debt holdings available for sale, which are carried at fair value in our financial statements. As of September 30, 2002, a significant percentage of our outstanding debt is at fixed interest rates. In our banking/finance operating segment, we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources. In addition, we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking/finance operating segment, our outstanding debt and portfolio debt holdings, individually and collectively, of a 100 basis point (1%) movement in market interest rates. We do not expect this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario. We are also exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that are carried at fair value. To mitigate this risk, we maintain a diversified investment portfolio. We operate mainly in the United States, but also provide services and earn revenues in Canada, the Bahamas, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia. A significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses, however, are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our revenues and expenses is not material at this time. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the United States. 40
