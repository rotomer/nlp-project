ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS In this section, we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition. In addition to historical information, we also make some statements relating to the future, which are called "forward looking statements". These forward looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. For this reason, you should not rely too heavily on them and should review the "Risk Factors" section, where we discuss these statements in more detail. GENERAL We derive the majority of our operating revenues, operating expenses and net income from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds, institutional, high net worth, private accounts and other investment products. This is our primary business activity and operating segment. The mutual funds and other products that we advise, collectively called our sponsored investment products, are distributed to the public globally under five distinct names: * Franklin * Templeton * Mutual Series * Bissett * Fiduciary Trust Our sponsored investment products include a broad range of global/international equity, U.S. domestic, hybrid/balanced, fixed income and money market mutual funds, as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management. To a lesser degree, our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. 27 Our secondary business and operating segment is banking/finance. Our banking/finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals, foundations and institutions, and consumer lending services. Our consumer lending activities include automotive lending related to the purchase, securitization, and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships, consumer credit and debit cards, real estate equity lines, and home equity/mortgage loans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three fiscal years. (IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) 2003 2002 FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 2002 2001 VS 2002 VS 2001 NET INCOME $502.8 $432.7 $484.7 16% (11)% EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Basic $1.98 $1.66 $1.92 19% (14)% Diluted 1.97 1.65 1.91 19% (14)% OPERATING MARGIN 25% 23% 22% Net income increased by 16% and diluted earnings per share increased by 19% in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues consistent with a 3% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management, higher gross sales, and an increase in billable shareholder accounts, as well as higher investment and other income in fiscal 2003 due to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments in fiscal 2002. These increases were partially offset by higher underwriting and distribution expenses and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2003 as compared to the prior year. An increase in repurchases of our stock, resulting in a decline in diluted weighted average shares outstanding from 262.1 million in fiscal 2002 to 254.7 million in fiscal 2003, also contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per common share. Net income decreased by 11% and diluted earnings per share decreased by 14% in fiscal 2002 primarily due to lower investment and other income related to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments and increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (IN BILLIONS) 2003 2002 AS OF THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 2002 2001 VS 2002 VS 2001 EQUITY Global/international $99.8 $76.5 $80.2 30% (5)% Domestic (U.S.) 55.4 41.4 44.5 34% (7)% TOTAL EQUITY 155.2 117.9 124.7 32% (5)% HYBRID/BALANCED 45.8 36.6 36.1 25% 1% FIXED INCOME Tax free 52.2 52.8 48.4 (1)% 9% Taxable Domestic (U.S.) 31.1 26.1 24.4 19% 7% Global/international 11.8 8.6 7.2 37% 19% TOTAL FIXED INCOME 95.1 87.5 80.0 9% 9% MONEY MARKET 5.8 5.8 5.6 4% TOTAL $301.9 $247.8 $246.4 22% 1% Simple monthly average for the $269.8 $263.2 $243.4 3% 8% year /1/ /1/ Investment management fees from approximately 50% of our assets under management at September 30, 2003 were calculated using daily average assets under management. 28 Our assets under management at September 30, 2003 were $301.9 billion, 22% higher than they were a year ago, due to excess sales over redemptions ("net inflows") of $14.4 billion and market appreciation of $42.0 billion, primarily in the latter half of fiscal 2003. Simple monthly average assets under management, which are generally more indicative of investment management fee revenue trends than the year over year change in ending assets under management, increased 3% during fiscal 2003. The simple monthly average mix of assets under management for the last three fiscal years is shown below. AS OF THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 2002 2001 PERCENTAGE OF SIMPLE MONTHLY AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT Equity 49% 52% 59% Fixed income 34% 31% 29% Hybrid/balanced 15% 15% 10% Money market 2% 2% 2% Total 100% 100% 100% The following table presents industry data showing average effective investment management fee rates /2/ for the years ended September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The data was obtained from Lipper(R) Inc. and our actual effective fee rates may vary from these rates. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 2002 2001 EQUITY Global/international 0.71% 0.71% 0.72% Domestic (U.S.) 0.54% 0.55% 0.55% HYBRID/BALANCED 0.42% 0.45% 0.46% FIXED INCOME Tax free 0.42% 0.43% 0.43% Taxable Domestic (U.S.) 0.43% 0.43% 0.45% Global/international 0.60% 0.59% 0.59% MONEY MARKET 0.27% 0.27% 0.28% /2/ Calculated by Franklin Templeton Investments based on asset weighted averages of management fee rates provided by Lipper(R) Inc. Industry effective investment management fee rates are calculated using all U.S. based, open ended funds that reported expense data to Lipper(R) Inc. as of the funds most recent annual report date, and for which management fee rates were greater or equal to zero. Industry effective fee rates reflect the investment management expenses of retail and institutional funds drawn from all distribution channels, without exception. The averages reflect combined retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes, and all distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuities are not included. For the 2003 fiscal year, our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management) declined to 0.55% from 0.56% in fiscal 2002. The change in the mix of assets under management, resulting from higher relative net inflows and appreciation for fixed income as compared to equity products, led to the slight decrease in the effective investment management fee rate. Generally, fixed income and hybrid/balanced products carry a lower management fee than equity assets. The decline in the effective management fee rate to 0.56% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 0.58% in fiscal 2001 was largely due to the inclusion of the assets under management of Fiduciary Trust Company International ("Fiduciary Trust") beginning in fiscal 2001 and market depreciation in equity assets in fiscal 2002. Approximately 64% of Fiduciary Trusts assets under management were classified as hybrid/balanced assets at the time of acquisition in April 2001. 29 Assets under management by shareholder location were as follows: (IN BILLIONS) AS OF THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 United States $239.9 Canada 21.5 Europe 19.9 Asia/Pacific and other 20.6 Total $301.9 Investors in the United States owned approximately 79% of our assets under management at September 30, 2003 and approximately 72% of our revenues originated in the United States in fiscal 2003. Investment advisory and administrative services related to these assets may be provided in jurisdictions outside the United States in accordance with contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products. Components of the change in our assets under management were as follows: (IN BILLIONS) AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED 2003 2002 SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 2002 2001 VS 2002 VS 2001 Beginning assets under management $247.8 $246.4 $229.9 1% 7% Sales 81.3 72.4 58.5 12% 24% Reinvested dividends 3.7 4.8 9.0 (23)% (47)% Redemptions (66.9) (57.5) (58.6) 16% (2)% Distributions (6.0) (7.2) (12.0) (17)% (40)% Acquisitions 0.8 49.5 (100)% (98)% Appreciation (depreciation) 42.0 (11.9) (29.9) N/A (60)% Ending assets under management $301.9 $247.8 $246.4 22% 1% During fiscal 2003 and 2002, our sponsored investment products experienced overall net inflows in contrast to the slight net outflows experienced in fiscal 2001. Gross product sales increased 12% while redemptions increased 16% in 2003. Our acquisition of Pioneer ITI AMC Limited ("Pioneer"), an Indian investment management company, in July 2002 increased our assets under management by $0.8 billion as of the date of this acquisition. In 2001, the acquisition of Bissett and Associates Investment Management Ltd. ("Bissett"), in October 2000, increased our assets under management by $3.7 billion, and the Fiduciary Trust acquisition, in April 2001, increased our assets under management by $45.8 billion, as of the dates of those acquisitions. Our products experienced $42.0 billion in appreciation in fiscal 2003 as compared to market depreciation in both fiscal 2002 and 2001 consistent with an overall increase in domestic and global equity markets in the latter half of 2003. 30 OPERATING REVENUES The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 and between fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. 2003 2002 PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES VS 2002 VS 2001 2003 2002 2001 Investment management fees 2% 4% 57% 58% 60% Underwriting and distribution fees 7% 12% 32% 31% 30% Shareholder servicing fees 14% (4)% 8% 8% 8% Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net N/A N/A Other, net 5% 86% 3% 3% 2% TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES 4% 7% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY In fiscal 2003, total operating revenues increased 4% over the prior year due to increased investment management, shareholder servicing and underwriting and distribution fees, consistent with a 3% increase in simple monthly average assets under management, an increase in billable shareholder accounts and higher gross product sales. In fiscal 2002, total operating revenues increased 7% over the prior year. Investment management and underwriting and distribution fees increased due to higher net sales and higher average assets under management. Other, net revenue increased due to the inclusion of Fiduciary Trust revenues for a full fiscal year in 2002, as well as higher net gains related to auto loan securitizations included in other, net revenue. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES Investment management fees, accounting for 57% of our operating revenues in fiscal 2003, include both investment advisory and administration fees. These fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. In return for these fees, we provide a combination of investment advisory, administrative and other management services. Investment management fees increased 2% in fiscal 2003 consistent with a 3% increase in simple monthly average assets under management, partially offset by a slight decline in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in average asset mix toward fixed income products, which generally carry a lower management fee than equity assets. Investment management fees increased 4% in fiscal 2002 primarily due to increased net sales, which increased assets under management, and the impact of including Fiduciary Trust for a full fiscal year. This increase was partially offset by a shift in our average asset mix toward fixed income investment products, which led to a decrease in our effective investment management fee rate. UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION FEES We earn underwriting fees from the sale of some classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase. Sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some classes of shares and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts. Therefore, underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales and the relative mix of sales between different share classes. Many of our sponsored investment products pay distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. While other contractual arrangements exist in international jurisdictions, in the United States, distribution fees include "12b 1 fees". These fees are subject to maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund and other regulatory limitations. We pay a significant portion of 31 underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisors and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf. See the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below. Overall, underwriting and distribution fees increased 7% in fiscal 2003. Underwriting fees increased 8% primarily due to a 12% increase in gross product sales, partially offset by a change in the sales mix. Distribution fees increased 6% consistent with a 3% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset mix. Underwriting and distribution fees increased 12% in fiscal 2002. Underwriting fees increased 24% consistent with a 24% increase in gross product sales, and distribution fees increased 5% consistent with an 8% increase in simple monthly average assets under management. SHAREHOLDER SERVICING FEES Shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some instances, sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management. We receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, including providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. In the United States, transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Shareholder servicing fees increased 14% in fiscal 2003. The increase reflects an increase in the overall number of billable shareholder accounts, partially offset by a decline in fee rates chargeable on accounts closed in the prior calendar year, under revised shareholder service fee agreements in the United States that became effective on January 1, 2003. The 0.7 million shareholder accounts added in July 2002 as a result of the acquisition of Pioneer also contributed to the increase in average billable accounts in fiscal 2003. Shareholder servicing fees decreased 4% in fiscal 2002 consistent with a decrease in the quarterly average number of billable accounts. OTHER, NET Other, net consists primarily of revenues from the banking/finance operating segment as well as income from custody services. Revenues from the banking/finance operating segment include interest income on loans, servicing income, and investment income on banking/finance investment securities, and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for probable loan losses. Other, net increased 5% in fiscal 2003 as a result of higher net interest income and auto loan servicing income, partially offset by lower custody fees. Other, net increased 86% in fiscal 2002 primarily due to the inclusion of Fiduciary Trusts banking and custody activities for a full fiscal year in 2002 and increased gains recognized on auto loan portfolio sales. 32 OPERATING EXPENSES The table below presents the percentage change in each expense category between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 and between fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. 2003 2002 PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL EXPENSES VS 2002 VS 2001 2003 2002 2001 Underwriting and distribution 6% 12% 38% 37% 35% Compensation and benefits 1% 5% 33% 33% 33% Information systems, technology and occupancy (3)% 12% 14% 15% 14% Advertising and promotion (14)% 1% 5% 6% 6% Amortization of deferred sales commissions 9% (2)% 4% 3% 4% Amortization of intangible assets (1)% (70)% 1% 1% 3% September 11, 2001 (recovery) expense, net N/A (100)% 0% 0% 0% Other 19% (2)% 5% 5% 5% TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES 2% 5% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY Operating expenses increased 2% during fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher underwriting and distribution and other expenses, which were partly offset by lower advertising and promotion, and information systems, technology and occupancy costs. Operating expenses increased 5% during fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to increased underwriting and distribution fees consistent with higher underwriting and distribution revenue, and higher compensation and benefits and technology and occupancy costs primarily due to the inclusion of Fiduciary Trusts activity for a full fiscal year in 2002. The increase in these expense categories was offset in part by a decline in amortization of intangible assets on discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION Underwriting and distribution includes expenses paid to financial advisers and other third parties for selling, distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products. Underwriting and distribution expenses increased 6% in fiscal 2003 and 12% in fiscal 2002 consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS Compensation and benefits increased 1% during fiscal 2003. Although we experienced a decrease in retention bonus commitments related to the acquisition of Fiduciary Trust, we have also experienced increases in employee insurance and other benefits costs in fiscal 2003. We employed approximately 6,500 people at September 30, 2003 compared to approximately 6,700 at the same time last year. In order to hire and retain key employees, we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive, which means that the level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenues. Compensation and benefits increased 5% during fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Fiduciary Trusts activity for a full fiscal year, partially offset by an overall decline in employees as well as the decision made by management during the quarter ended December 2001 to reduce employee salaries by 5% or 10%, depending on specific salary categories. In May 2002, we reinstated salaries for employees whose salaries were reduced by 5% and, in July 2002, we reinstated employee salaries in the 10% reduction category. 33 INFORMATION SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY Information systems, technology and occupancy costs decreased 3% in fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily due to decreased purchases of information system and technology equipment leading to decreased depreciation (certain of our technology equipment is periodically replaced with new equipment under our technology outsourcing agreement) and lower expenditures on technology projects. While continuing to work on new technology initiatives and investment in our technology infrastructure, we have slowed down a number of initiatives and delayed the start of other technology projects given the recent economic slowdown and our focus on cost control and management. Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased 12% in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of costs related to the outsourcing of the management of our data center and distributed server operations and added technology and occupancy costs of the Fiduciary Trust acquisition for a full fiscal year in 2002. Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs for the last three fiscal years were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS) 2003 2002 2001 Net carrying amount at beginning of period $121,486 $162,857 $156,895 Additions during period, net of disposals and other adjustments 25,812 35,570 69,794 Net assets purchased through acquisitions 206 11,266 Amortization during period (68,172) (77,147) (75,098) Net carrying amount at end of period $79,126 $121,486 $162,857 ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION Advertising and promotion decreased 14% during fiscal 2003 and increased 1% in fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2002 we incurred higher promotion and advertising costs to educate the sales channels and the investing public about the strong relative investment performance of our sponsored investment products. We are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly or decrease more slowly than our revenues. AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS Certain fund share classes, including Class B, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders, although our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale. In the United States, Class A shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met. However, our U.S. distribution subsidiary pays a commission on these sales. Class C shares are sold with a front end sales charge that is lower than the commission paid by the U.S. distributor. We defer and amortize all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries over 18 months to 8 years depending on share class or financing arrangements. We have arranged to finance our Class B and C deferred commission assets ("DCA") arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations through Lightning Finance Company Limited ("LFL"), a company in which we have a 49% ownership interest. In the United States, LFL has entered into a financing agreement with our U.S. distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the assets until resold by LFL. As a result, we retain DCA sold to LFL under the U.S. agreement in our financial statements and amortize them over an 8 year period, or until sold by LFL to third parties. In contrast to the U.S. arrangement, LFL has entered into direct agreements with our Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and, as a result, we do not record DCA from these sources in our financial statements. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased 9% in fiscal 2003 from the prior year primarily due to increased gross product sales and because LFL did not sell any U.S. DCA in a securitization transaction in 34 fiscal 2003, while it sold approximately $61.5 million U.S. DCA in fiscal 2002. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 2% in fiscal 2002, due to changes in sales mix and existing financing arrangements. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS Amortization of intangible assets decreased 1% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to foreign currency movements. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 70% in fiscal 2002 due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), on October 1, 2001. Under SFAS 142, we ceased to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. This resulted in a reduction in amortization expense of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2002 as compared to the prior year. As of March 31, 2003, we completed our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of October 1, 2002. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) includes investment and other income and interest expense. Beginning July 1, 2003, realized and unrealized gains (losses), net, of sponsored investment products that were consolidated in our financial statements on adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"), are also included in this classification. See the description of FIN 46 in Critical Accounting Policies below. Investment and other income is comprised primarily of the following: * dividends from investments * interest income from investments in bonds and government securities * realized gains and losses on investments * foreign currency exchange gains and losses * miscellaneous income, including gain or loss on disposal of property. Net other income was $52.1 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to a net expense of $7.2 million in fiscal 2002 due to a $60.1 million other than temporary decline in value of some of our investments recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Net other income was $125.8 million in fiscal 2001 due to net realized gains of approximately $34.2 million on the sale of certain sponsored investment products held for investment purposes and other realized gains of $24.6 million related to the sale of our former headquarters building in San Mateo. TAXES ON INCOME As a multi national corporation, we provide investment management services to a wide range of international investment products, often managed from locations outside the United States. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the United States. The mix of income (primarily investment management fees) subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the United States, produces a lower overall effective tax rate than existing U.S. Federal and state tax rates. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 increased to 28% compared to 25% in fiscal 2002 and 24% in fiscal 2001. The effective tax rate will continue to reflect the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income, as well as other factors. MATERIAL CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At September 30, 2003, we had $1,053.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $980.6 million at September 30, 2002. Cash and cash equivalents include cash, U.S. Treasury bills and other debt instruments with maturities of three months or less from the purchase date and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash, including money market funds. Liquid assets, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments available for sale and current receivables, increased to $3,272.3 million at September 30, 2003 from $2,826.0 million at September 30, 2002. Liquid assets have increased in fiscal 2003 primarily due to cash provided by operating activities, proceeds received from auto loan securitizations and the issuance of medium term notes, offset in part by common stock repurchases and loan origination activity. 35 Outstanding debt, including Federal Home Loan Bank advances and current maturities of long term debt, increased to $1,123.7 million at September 30, 2003, compared to $611.5 million at September 30, 2002. The balance at September 30, 2003 included $520.3 million in principal and accrued interest related to outstanding convertible notes, $420.0 million in five year senior notes and $168.8 million in other long term debt, including current maturities. Other long term debt consisted primarily of deferred commission liabilities recognized in relation to U.S. DCA financed by LFL that had not yet been sold by LFL in a securitization transaction (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of debt outstanding). Each of the $1,000 (principal amount at maturity) convertible notes is convertible into 9.3604 shares of our common stock. We may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after May 11, 2006 at their accreted value. On May 12, 2003, at the option of the holders, we repurchased convertible notes with a face value of $5.9 million principal amount at maturity, for $3.5 million in cash, the accreted value of the notes as of May 11, 2003. We may have to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value, at the option of the holders, on May 11 of 2004, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 and 2026. In this event, we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock. The amount of convertible notes that will be redeemed depends on, among other factors, the performance of our common stock. As of September 30, 2002, outstanding debt included $514.2 million related to the convertible notes and $88.8 million of other long term debt, including current maturities. The increase in outstanding debt from September 30, 2002 is primarily due to the issuance of the five year senior notes in April 2003, the increase in U.S. DCA financed by LFL, and the accretion of interest on the convertible notes. As of September 30, 2003, we had $500.0 million of commercial paper and $300.0 million of debt and equity securities available to be issued under shelf registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our committed revolving credit facilities at September 30, 2003 totaled $420.0 million, of which, $210.0 million was under a 364 day facility. The remaining $210.0 million facility is under a five year facility that will expire in June 2007. In addition, at September 30, 2003, our banking/finance operating segment had $559.5 million in available uncommitted short term bank lines under the Federal Reserve Funds system, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window, and Federal Home Loan Bank short term borrowing capacity. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. In extreme circumstances, we might not be able to access this liquidity readily. Our banking/finance operating segment periodically enters into auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors. Gross sale proceeds from these transactions were $464.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $565.2 million in fiscal 2002. The outstanding loan balances held by these special purpose entities were $680.7 million as of September 30, 2003 and $530.9 million as of September 30, 2002. Our ability to access the securitization market will directly affect our plans to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future. The sales commissions that we have financed globally through LFL during fiscal 2003, were approximately $161.3 million compared to $135.3 million in fiscal 2002. LFLs ability to access credit facilities and the securitization market will directly affect our existing financing arrangements. We expect that the main uses of cash will be to: * expand our core business * make strategic acquisitions * acquire shares of our common stock * fund property and equipment purchases * pay operating expenses of the business * enhance our technology infrastructure * improve our business processes * pay shareholder dividends * repay and service debt. 36 We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through the following: * existing liquid assets * continuing cash flow from operations * borrowing capacity under current credit facilities * ability to issue debt or equity securities * mutual fund sales commission financing arrangement. In particular, we expect to finance future investment in our banking/finance activities through operating cash flows, debt, increased deposit base, or through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS Our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2003 were as follows: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS MORE (IN THOUSANDS) TOTAL THAN 1 1 3 4 5 THAN 5 YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS Long term debt obligations $1,108,881 $22,450 $46,300 $468,236 $571,895 Operating lease obligations 268,577 34,760 60,881 49,189 123,747 In addition, at September 30, 2003, the banking/finance operating segment had commitments to extend credit aggregating $280.5 million, primarily under its credit card lines and had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling $5.5 million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers, primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers. These standby letters of credit, issued prior to January 1, 2003, were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of $15.2 million as of September 30, 2003 and commercial real estate. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As discussed above, we obtain financing for sales commissions that we pay to brokers on Class B and C shares through LFL, a company incorporated in Ireland whose sole business purpose is to finance our DCA. We hold a 49% ownership interest in LFL and we account for this ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Our exposure to loss related to our investment in LFL is limited to the carrying value of our investment and loans, and interest and fees receivable from LFL. At September 30, 2003, those amounts approximated $54.7 million. During fiscal 2003, we financed approximately $161.3 million of sales commissions through LFL and we recognized pre tax income of approximately $0.7 million for our share of the net income of LFL. As discussed above, our banking/finance operating segment periodically enters into auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors. Our main objective in entering in securitization transactions is to obtain financing for auto loan activities. Securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled $680.7 million at September 30, 2003 and $530.9 million at September 30, 2002. In relation to these transactions, we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to the holders of the notes up to certain levels as specified under the related agreements. As of September 30, 2003, the maximum potential amount of future payments was $13.7 million relating to guarantees made prior to January 1, 2003. In addition, our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2003 included a $0.1 million liability to reflect obligations arising from an auto securitization transaction that we entered into in June 2003. We are contingently liable for approximately $145.0 million in residual guarantees under an operating lease for our global corporate headquarters campus in San Mateo, California. This represents about 85% of the total construction costs of $170.0 million. We are also contingently liable to purchase the corporate headquarters campus for an amount equal to the final construction costs of $170.0 million if an event of default occurs under the agreement. An event of default includes, but is not limited to, failure to make lease payments when due and 37 failure to maintain required insurance. Management considers the possibility of default under the provisions of the agreement to be remote. Currently, the lease is treated as an operating lease, as none of the capitalization criteria under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases", were met at the inception of the lease. We anticipate that we will consolidate our corporate headquarters campus under the requirements of FIN 46 in the period ending December 31, 2003. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies. INTANGIBLE ASSETS At September 30, 2003 our assets included intangible assets as follows: (IN THOUSANDS) NET CARRYING AMOUNT Goodwill $1,335,517 Intangible assets definite lived 205,636 Intangible assets indefinite lived 478,645 Total $2,019,798 Under SFAS 142, we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles when there is an indication of impairment, or at least once a year. As of March 31, 2003, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of October 1, 2002. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment at each reporting period on the basis of the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows, without interest charges, to be derived from these assets. In performing our analysis, we used certain assumptions and estimates including those related to discount rates and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets, based on, among other factors, historical trends and the characteristics of the assets. While we believe that our testing was appropriate, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense. INCOME TAXES As a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the United States. We have not made a provision for U.S. taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are intended to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time. These earnings approximated $2.1 billion at September 30, 2003. Changes to our policy of reinvesting foreign earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operation. 38 VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS We record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Where available, we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information. However, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For example, we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold, and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value. We evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time. As most of our investments are carried at fair value, if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist, the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income, in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined. In fiscal 2002, we recognized $60.1 million for an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements. LOSS CONTINGENCIES We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claim based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2003 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from these matters. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES FIN 46, issued in January 2003, requires consolidation of a variable interest entity ("VIE") by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. The consolidation and disclosure provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and, originally, for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. However, in October 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position FIN 46 6, "Effective Date of FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FSP FIN 46 6"), deferring the consolidation provisions of FIN 46 to interim or annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. Six VIEs, all sponsored investment products with inception dates after January 31, 2003, have been consolidated in our financial statements at September 30, 2003. The effect of this consolidation was to increase our consolidated net income by $1.1 million and our financial position by $10.4 million for and as of the year ended September 30, 2003. Our exposure to loss related to our investment in these consolidated VIEs is limited to our investment and fees earned, but not yet received, totaling $38.7 million at September 30, 2003. We are continuing our evaluation of sponsored investment products and will adopt the consolidation provisions of FIN 46 for products created before February 1, 2003 in the quarter ending December 31, 2003, in accordance with FSP FIN 46 6. Based on the current requirements of FIN 46, we estimate that the effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 will be to increase assets by approximately $1,119.2 million, based on September 30, 2003 values. Our exposure to loss as a result of our investment in these VIEs is limited to our investment, totaling $167.1 million at September 30, 2003, and fees earned but not yet received. In addition, as the primary beneficiary of our corporate headquarters campus, a lessor trust, we anticipate that we will consolidate the trust under the provisions of FIN 46 as of December 31, 2003. The impact of consolidating the trust will be to increase property and equipment, net by approximately $157.6 million and current maturities of long term debt, by approximately $164.9 million as of this date. 39 In relation to our purchase of Darby Overseas Investments, Ltd. and Darby Overseas, L.P., we anticipate that we will consolidate sponsored investment products with total assets of approximately $444.4 million as of October 1, 2003. Evaluating whether related entities are VIEs and determining whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, is highly complex and involves the use of estimates and assumptions. In general, when we estimate the expected residual returns of a VIE based on discounted cash flows, we make certain assumptions about discount rates. In addition, we determine the volatility of the VIEs expected returns based on available historical information and managements estimates. While we believe that our testing and approach were appropriate, future changes in estimates and assumptions may affect our decision to consolidate one or more VIEs in our financial statements. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional FIN 46 disclosures.

We compete with numerous investment management companies, stock brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions. Continuing consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own. Additionally, competing securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products, which could limit the distribution of our investment products. To the extent that existing or potential customers, including securities dealers, decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and net income could decline. CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS ON WHICH WE DEPEND COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND HINDER OUR GROWTH. We derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker/dealers and other similar investment advisors. Increasing competition for these distribution channels has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future. Higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings. Additionally, if one of the major financial advisors who distribute our products were to cease their operations, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings. Moreover, our failure to maintain strong business 41 relationships with these advisors would impair our ability to distribute and sell our products, which would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management, related revenues and overall business and financial condition. WE HAVE BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASED RISK OF ASSET VOLATILITY FROM CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS. We have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets due to the continuing threat of terrorism. Declines in these markets have caused in the past, and would cause in the future, a decline in our revenue and income. THE LEVELS OF OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, WHICH IN TURN IMPACT REVENUES, ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. Global economic conditions, changes in the equity market place, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix, market values and levels of our assets under management. Changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income, since we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage. Similarly, our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation. WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN NUMEROUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. We sell mutual funds and offer investment advisory and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally. Regulators in these jurisdictions could change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets. OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE WIDELY VARIED SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS CAN BE IMPEDED BY SYSTEMS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. Our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business both domestically and abroad, depends on our ability to integrate the varied accounting, financial, information and operational systems of our various businesses on a global basis. OUR INABILITY TO MEET CASH NEEDS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. Our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value, our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock. Similarly, our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables, and to obtain continued financing for Class B and C shares, is also subject to the markets perception of those assets, finance rates offered by competitors, and the general market for private debt. If we are unable to obtain these funds and financing, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans. CERTAIN OF THE PORTFOLIOS WE MANAGE INCLUDING OUR EMERGING MARKET PORTFOLIOS AND RELATED REVENUES ARE VULNERABLE TO MARKET SPECIFIC POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC RISKS. Our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental polices, expropriation, nationalization, asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership. Foreign trading markets, particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than the U.S. and other established markets. DIVERSE AND STRONG COMPETITION LIMITS THE INTEREST RATES THAT WE CAN CHARGE ON CONSUMER LOANS. We compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans, which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales or in some cases zero interest rates. Our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business. Economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans, which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase. WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATION. Upon completion of our acquisition of Fiduciary Trust in April 2001, we became a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. We are subject to the restrictions, limitations, or prohibitions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. The Federal Reserve Board may impose additional limitations or restrictions on our activities, including if the Federal Reserve Board believes 42 that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board may also take actions as appropriate to enforce applicable federal law. TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING RISK COULD CONSTRAIN OUR OPERATIONS. We are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology, operating systems and premises. Although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third party failures, which could negatively impact our operations. VARIOUS ONGOING GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS AND REFORMS RELATING TO CERTAIN PRACTICES IN THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. As part of various ongoing investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, the New York Attorney General and the Secretary of State of Massachusetts relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and sales compensation arrangements, Franklin Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries (as used in this section, together, the "Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and employees of the Company, have received requests for information and or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company and, where applicable, the relevant individuals, are providing documents and information in response to these requests and subpoenas. In addition, the Company is responding to requests for similar kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of the foreign countries where the Company conducts its global asset management business. The Company also has been conducting its own internal fact finding inquiry with the assistance of outside counsel. The Company is seeking to determine whether any shareholders of the Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series Funds (each a "Fund" and together, "Funds"), including Company employees, were permitted to engage in late trading or in market timing transactions contrary to the policies of the affected Fund and, if so, the circumstances and persons involved. The Company is committed to taking action to protect the interests of our Funds shareholders, including appropriate action against any Company personnel found to have knowingly permitted or personally engaged in improper trading practices. To date, the Company has identified some instances of frequent trading in shares of certain Funds by a few current or former employees in their personal 401(k) plan accounts. These individuals include one trader and one officer of the Funds. These two individuals have been placed on administrative leave and the officer has resigned from his positions with the Funds. Although our inquiry is not complete, to date we have found no instances of inappropriate mutual fund trading by any portfolio manager, investment analyst or officer of Franklin Resources, Inc. The independent directors of the Funds and the Company have retained independent outside counsel to review these matters, to determine if any violations of law or policies or inappropriate trading occurred, to conduct such further inquiries as counsel may deem necessary and to report their findings and recommendations to the independent directors of the Funds and the Companys board of directors. The Companys internal inquiry regarding market timing and late trading is still ongoing, and we have not yet completed the gathering or evaluation of the relevant facts. Although we have not identified any late trading problems, we have identified various instances of frequent trading where we have questions about the propriety of what occurred and what responsibility, if any, the Company may bear. Pending completion of the fact finding process, one officer of a subsidiary of the Company has been placed on administrative leave. If the Company finds that it bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to our Funds, we are committed to making the Funds whole. Separately, in connection with the SECs private investigation that resulted in a proceeding against Morgan Stanley DW, Inc., the Company has been asked to furnish documents and testimony relating to its arrangements to compensate brokers who sell Fund shares. Effective November 28, 2003, the Company determined not to direct any further brokerage where the allocation is based on sale of Fund shares in order to satisfy preferred list or other shelf space arrangements, which determination may have a material adverse financial impact on the Company. 43 The Company cannot state with certainty the eventual outcome of the foregoing governmental investigations, the review by independent outside counsel or the Companys own internal investigation, which could have a material negative financial impact on the Company. However, public trust and confidence are critical to the Companys business and any material loss of investor and or client confidence could result in a significant decline in assets under management by the Company, which would have an adverse effect on future financial results. In addition, pending regulatory and legislative actions and reforms affecting the mutual fund industry may significantly increase the Companys costs of doing business and or negatively impact its revenues, either of which could have a material negative impact on the Companys financial results. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk: the potential loss due to changes in the value of investments resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange and or equity prices. Management is responsible for managing this risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily through financing transactions and portfolio debt holdings available for sale, which are carried at fair value in our financial statements. As of September 30, 2003, a significant percentage of our outstanding debt was at fixed interest rates. In our banking/finance operating segment, we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources. In addition, as of September 30, 2003, we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking/finance operating segment balances, our outstanding debt and portfolio debt holdings, individually and collectively, of a 100 basis point (1%) movement in market interest rates. We do not expect this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario. We operate primarily in the United States, but also provide services and earn revenues in Canada, the Bahamas, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia. A significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses, however, are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our revenues and expenses is not material at this time. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the United States. We are also exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that are carried at fair value. To mitigate this risk, we maintain a diversified investment portfolio. 44
