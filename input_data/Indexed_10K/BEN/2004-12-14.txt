ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS In this section, we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition. In addition to historical information, we also make some statements relating to the future, which are called "forward looking statements". These forward looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. For this reason, you should not rely too heavily on them and should review the "Risk Factors" section, where we discuss these statements in more detail. GENERAL We derive the majority of our operating revenues, operating expenses and net income from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds, institutional accounts, high net worth clients, private accounts and other investment products. This is our primary business activity and operating segment. The mutual funds and other products that we advise, collectively called our sponsored investment products, are distributed to the public globally under six distinct names: * Franklin * Templeton * Mutual Series * Bissett * Fiduciary Trust * Darby Overseas 32 Our sponsored investment products include a broad range of global/international equity, U.S. domestic, hybrid, fixed income and money market mutual funds, as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management. To a lesser degree, our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. Our secondary business and operating segment is banking/finance. Our banking/finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals, foundations and institutions, and consumer lending services. Our consumer lending activities include automotive lending related to the purchase, securitization, and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships, consumer credit and debit cards, real estate equity lines, and home equity/mortgage loans. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Fiscal 2004 was challenging for the mutual fund industry as various regulatory bodies continued their investigations of certain industry practices. We are working with a number of government regulators who are looking into matters involving frequent trading (commonly referred to as "market timing") policies and practices, marketing support payments to securities broker/dealers who sell fund shares, and other industry concerns. Despite the scrutiny, key performance measures continued to improve in fiscal 2004. Our diluted earnings per share grew to $2.80 in fiscal 2004, as compared to $1.97 in fiscal 2003 and $1.65 in fiscal 2002. Our operating margin increased to 27% in fiscal 2004, as compared to 25% in fiscal 2003 and 23% in fiscal 2002. Market appreciation and excess sales over redemptions increased our assets under management to an all time record of $361.9 billion at September 30, 2004, as compared to $301.9 billion at September 30, 2003 and $247.8 billion at September 30, 2002. Our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management) was 0.58% in fiscal 2004, as compared to 0.55% in fiscal 2003 and 0.56% in fiscal 2002. As our client base broadens geographically, we remain attentive to the specialized needs of these clients and continue to expand the investment choices available to them. To that end, on October 1, 2003, we completed the acquisition of Darby Overseas Investments, Ltd. and Darby Overseas Partners, L.P. (collectively "Darby"), a group specializing in private equity, mezzanine and emerging markets fixed income products. In fiscal 2002, we acquired Pioneer ITI AMC Limited ("Pioneer"), an Indian investment management company. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three fiscal years. (in millions except per share amounts) 2004 2003 FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 2003 2002 VS 2003 VS 2002 NET INCOME $706.7 $502.8 $432.7 41% 16% EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Basic $2.84 $1.98 $1.66 43% 19% Diluted 2.80 1.97 1.65 42% 19% OPERATING MARGIN 27% 25% 23% Net income increased by 41% and diluted earnings per share increased by 42% in fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues consistent with a 26% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management, higher gross sales on which commissions are earned, and an increase in billable shareholder accounts. These increases were partially offset by higher underwriting and distribution expenses, higher compensation and benefits expense, the provision for governmental investigations, proceedings and actions and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2004 as compared to the prior year. The decline in diluted weighted average shares outstanding from 254.7 million in fiscal 2003 to 252.2 million in fiscal 2004, also contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per common share. The decrease in diluted weighted average 33 shares outstanding resulted from stock repurchases, especially in the latter half of fiscal 2003, partially offset by an increase in dilution from the assumed conversion of stock options granted as the price of our common stock increased during fiscal 2004. Net income increased by 16% and diluted earnings per share increased by 19% in fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher operating revenues consistent with a 3% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management, as well as higher investment and other income in fiscal 2003 due to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments in fiscal 2002. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (in billions) 2004 2003 AS OF THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 2003 2002 VS 2003 VS 2002 EQUITY Global/international $132.9 $99.8 $76.5 33% 30% Domestic (U.S.) 66.4 55.4 41.4 20% 34% TOTAL EQUITY 199.3 155.2 117.9 28% 32% HYBRID 59.0 45.8 36.6 29% 25% FIXED INCOME Tax free 51.3 52.2 52.8 (2)% (1)% Taxable Domestic (U.S.) 31.3 31.1 26.1 1% 19% Global/international 14.2 11.8 8.6 20% 37% TOTAL FIXED INCOME 96.8 95.1 87.5 2% 9% MONEY MARKET 6.8 5.8 5.8 17% TOTAL $361.9 $301.9 $247.8 20% 22% Simple monthly average for the year /1 $340.2 $269.8 $263.2 26% 3% /1 Investment management fees from approximately 45% of our assets under management at September 30, 2004 were calculated using daily average assets under management. Our assets under management at September 30, 2004 were $361.9 billion, 20% higher than they were a year ago, due to excess sales over redemptions of $22.4 billion and market appreciation of $38.9 billion, primarily in the first half of fiscal 2004. Simple monthly average assets under management, which are generally more indicative of investment management fee revenue trends than the year over year change in ending assets under management, increased 26% during fiscal 2004. The simple monthly average mix of assets under management for the last three fiscal years is shown below. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 2003 2002 PERCENTAGE OF SIMPLE MONTHLY AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT Equity 54% 49% 52% Fixed income 28% 34% 31% Hybrid 16% 15% 15% Money market 2% 2% 2% TOTAL 100% 100% 100% 34 The following table presents industry data showing average effective investment management fee rates /1 for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002. The data was obtained from Lipper(R) Inc. and our actual effective fee rates may vary from these rates.

The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity products are not included. For the 2004 fiscal year, our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management) increased to 0.58% from 0.55% in fiscal 2003. The change in the mix of assets under management, resulting from higher excess sales over redemptions and appreciation for equity as compared to fixed income products, led to the increase in the effective investment management fee rate. Generally, equity products carry higher management fees than fixed income products. For the 2003 fiscal year, our effective investment management fee rate declined to 0.55% from 0.56% in fiscal 2002. The change in the mix of assets under management, resulting from higher relative excess sales over redemptions and appreciation for fixed income as compared to equity products, led to the slight decrease in the effective investment management fee rate. Assets under management by sales office location were as follows: (in billions) AS OF THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 % OF TOTAL 2003 % OF TOTAL United States $265.3 73% $225.0 74% Canada 25.8 7% 20.9 7% Europe 29.5 8% 20.4 7% Asia/Pacific and other /1 41.3 12% 35.6 12% TOTAL $361.9 100% $301.9 100% /1 Includes multi jurisdictional assets under management. Approximately 73% of our assets under management at September 30, 2004 originated from our U.S. sales offices and approximately 69% of our revenues originated in the United States in fiscal 2004. Due to the global nature of our business operations, investment advisory and administrative services may be performed in locations unrelated to the location of the shareholder. 35 Components of the change in our assets under management were as follows: (in billions) 2004 2003 AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 2003 2002 VS 2003 VS 2002 Beginning assets under management $301.9 $247.8 $246.4 22% 1% Sales 96.8 81.3 72.4 19% 12% Reinvested dividends 4.9 3.7 4.8 32% (23)% Redemptions (74.4) (66.9) (57.5) 11% 16% Distributions (7.1) (6.0) (7.2) 18% (17)% Acquisitions 0.9 0.8 N/A (100)% Appreciation (depreciation) 38.9 42.0 (11.9) (7%) N/A ENDING ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT $361.9 $301.9 $247.8 20% 22% Excess sales over redemptions were $22.4 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to $14.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $14.9 million in fiscal 2002. Gross product sales increased 19% while redemptions increased 11% in 2004. Darby added $0.9 billion in assets under management, related to private equity, mezzanine and emerging markets fixed income products as of the acquisition date, on October 1, 2003. Our acquisition of Pioneer, in July 2002, increased our assets under management by $0.8 billion as of the date of this acquisition. Our products experienced $38.9 billion in appreciation in fiscal 2004, as compared to $42.0 billion in fiscal 2003 and market depreciation of $11.9 billion in fiscal 2002. OPERATING REVENUES The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES 2004 2003 VS 2003 VS 2002 2004 2003 2002 Investment management fees 32% 2% 57% 57% Underwriting and distribution fees 35% 7% 34% 32% 31% Shareholder servicing fees 12% 14% 7% 8% 8% Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net 3,684% N/A Other, net (8%) 5% 2% 3% 3% TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES 31% 4% 100% 100% 100% INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES Investment management fees, accounting for 57% of our operating revenues in fiscal 2004, include both investment advisory and administration fees. These fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. In return for these fees, we provide a combination of investment advisory, administrative and other management services. Investment management fees increased 32% in fiscal 2004 consistent with a 26% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in average asset mix toward equity products, which generally carry a higher management fee than fixed income assets. Investment management fees increased 2% in fiscal 2003 consistent with a 3% increase in simple monthly average assets under management, partially offset by a slight decline in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in average asset mix toward fixed income products. 36 UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION FEES We earn underwriting fees from the sale of some classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase. Sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some classes of shares and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts. Therefore, underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales and the relative mix of sales between different share classes. Many of our sponsored investment products pay distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. While other contractual arrangements exist in international jurisdictions, in the United States, distribution fees include "12b 1 fees". These fees are subject to maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund and other regulatory limitations. We pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf. See the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below. Overall, underwriting and distribution fees increased 35% in fiscal 2004. Underwriting fees increased 33% primarily due to a 19% increase in gross product sales along with a change in the sales mix. Distribution fees increased 36% consistent with a 26% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset and share class mix. Underwriting and distribution fees increased 7% in fiscal 2003. Underwriting fees increased 8% primarily due to a 12% increase in gross product sales, partially offset by a change in the sales mix. Distribution fees increased 6% consistent with a 3% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset and share class mix. SHAREHOLDER SERVICING FEES Shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some instances, sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management. We receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, including providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. In the United States, transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Shareholder servicing fees increased 12% in fiscal 2004. The increase reflects an 18% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts, primarily due to the overall increase in number of shareholder accounts billable under revised shareholder service fee agreements in the United States that became effective on January 1, 2003, partially offset by a decline in fee rates chargeable on accounts closed in the prior calendar year, under these agreements. Shareholder servicing fees increased 14% in fiscal 2003. The increase reflects an increase in the overall number of billable shareholder accounts, partially offset by a decline in fee rates chargeable on accounts closed in the prior calendar year, under revised shareholder service fee agreements in the United States that became effective on January 1, 2003. The 0.7 million shareholder accounts added in July 2002 as a result of the acquisition of Pioneer also contributed to the increase in average billable accounts in fiscal 2003. CONSOLIDATED SPONSORED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS INCOME, NET Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net reflects the net operating income of majority owned sponsored investment products, including dividends received. The increase in fiscal 2004 reflects an increase in the number of products that have been consolidated in our results of operations. 37 OTHER, NET Other, net consists primarily of revenues from the banking/finance operating segment as well as income from custody services. Revenues from the banking/finance operating segment include interest income on loans, servicing income, and investment income on banking/finance investment securities, and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for probable loan losses. Other, net decreased 8% in fiscal 2004 due to lower realized gains on sale of automotive loans and decreased interest income on investments, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for probable loan losses related to our consumer lending portfolio and lower interest expense. Other, net increased 5% in fiscal 2003 as a result of higher net interest income and auto loan servicing income, partially offset by lower custody fees. OPERATING EXPENSES The table below presents the percentage change in each expense category between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL EXPENSES 2004 2003 VS 2003 VS 2002 2004 2003 2002 Underwriting and distribution 35% 7% 41% 39% 37% Compensation and benefits 18% 1% 31% 33% 33% Information systems, technology and occupancy (4)% (3)% 11% 14% 15% Advertising and promotion 21% (14)% 4% 4% 6% Amortization of deferred sales commissions 35% 9% 4% 4% 3% Amortization of intangible assets 4% (1)% 1% 1% 1% Provision for mutual fund proceedings, actions and investigations N/A N/A 4% N/A N/A September 11, 2001 (recovery) expense, net 588% N/A (1)% N/A Other 24% 19% 5% 5% 5% TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES 26% 2% 100% 100% 100% UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION Underwriting and distribution includes expenses paid to financial advisers and other third parties for selling, distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products. Underwriting and distribution expenses increased 35% in fiscal 2004 and 7% in fiscal 2003 consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS Compensation and benefits increased 18% during fiscal 2004. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in bonus expense under the Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, which awards cash and stock bonuses based, in part, on our performance. In addition, merit salary increases effective in October 2003 and additional compensation and benefit costs related to the acquisition of Darby in October 2003 increased costs in fiscal 2004. The increase was partly reduced by the decline of retention bonus commitments related to the acquisition of Fiduciary Trust Company International ("Fiduciary Trust") in April 2001, as we fulfilled cash payout obligations under the employee retention and transition compensation program that were required to be paid within approximately two years of the acquisition date. We employed approximately 6,700 people at September 30, 2004 as compared to about 6,500 at September 30, 2003. In order to attract and retain talented individuals, we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive, which means that the level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenues. 38 Compensation and benefits increased 1% during fiscal 2003. Although we experienced a decrease in retention bonus commitments related to the acquisition of Fiduciary Trust, we also experienced increases in employee insurance and other benefits costs in fiscal 2003. We employed approximately 6,500 people at September 30, 2003 compared to approximately 6,700 at September 30, 2002. INFORMATION SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY Information systems, technology and occupancy costs decreased 4% in fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation levels for equipment and software related to a decrease in purchases of information system and technology equipment as certain of our technology equipment is periodically replaced with new equipment under our technology outsourcing agreement, as well as a stabilization in the number and the scope of new technology project initiatives. The decline in information systems and technology expense was partly offset by an increase in outside data services as well as an increase in building depreciation related to the consolidation of our headquarters campus in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003)" ("FIN 46 R") in our results of operation effective December 31, 2003 and subsequent purchase of the property in September 2004. Information systems, technology and occupancy costs decreased 3% in fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation levels for equipment and software. Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs for the last three fiscal years were as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net carrying amount at beginning of period $79.1 $121.5 $162.9 Additions during period, net of disposals and other adjustments 16.3 25.8 35.6 Net assets purchased through acquisitions 0.3 0.2 Amortization during period (44.4) (68.2) (77.2) NET CARRYING AMOUNT AT END OF PERIOD $51.3 $79.1 $121.5 ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION Advertising and promotion increased 21% during fiscal 2004 and decreased 14% in fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 was due to the elimination of directed brokerage effective November 28, 2003 and higher expenditures on direct advertising campaigns and marketing materials. We are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly or decrease more slowly than our revenues. AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS Certain fund share classes, including Class B, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders, although our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale. In the United States, Class A shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met, and Class C shares are sold without a front end sales charge effective January 1, 2004. However, our U.S. distribution subsidiary pays a commission on these sales. We defer and amortize all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries in excess of commissions we receive from shareholders, over 12 months to 8 years depending on share class or financing arrangements. We have arranged to finance our Class B and certain of our Class C deferred commission assets ("DCA") arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations through Lightning Finance Company Limited ("LFL"), a company in which we have a 49% ownership interest. In the United States, LFL has entered into a financing agreement with our U.S. distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the assets until resold by LFL. As a result, we retain DCA sold to LFL under the U.S. agreement in our financial statements and amortize them over an 8 year period, or until sold by LFL to third parties. In contrast to the U.S. arrangement, LFL has entered into direct agreements with our Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and, as a result, we do not record DCA from these sources on our Consolidated Balance 39 Sheets. The boards of the funds that offer Class B shares have approved a proposal to cease the offering of Class B shares to new investors and existing shareholders desiring to make additional purchases. Existing Class B shareholders would continue to be permitted to exchange shares into Class B shares of different funds. Existing Class B shareholders would also be permitted to continue to reinvest dividends in additional Class B shares. The cessation of purchases of Class B shares by new investors and existing shareholders will be effective in the first calendar quarter of 2005 and may have a negative effect on the overall sales of the funds shares. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased 35% in fiscal 2004 from the prior year primarily due to increased gross product sales. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased 9% in fiscal 2003 from the prior year primarily due to increased gross product sales and because LFL did not sell any U.S. DCA in a securitization transaction in fiscal 2003, while it sold approximately $61.5 million U.S. DCA in fiscal 2002. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS Amortization of intangible assets increased 4% in fiscal 2004 and decreased 1% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to foreign currency movements in intangible assets not denominated in U.S. dollars. As of March 31, 2004, we completed our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets, and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of October 1, 2003. PROVISION FOR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS In fiscal 2004, we recognized charges to income aggregating to $105.0 million ($80.6 million, net of taxes) related to ongoing governmental investigations, proceedings and actions. See also Risk Factors below. SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 RECOVERY, NET In January 2004, we received $32.5 million from our insurance carrier for claims related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that destroyed Fiduciary Trusts headquarters. These proceeds represented final recoveries for claims submitted to our insurance carrier. We realized a gain of $30.3 million ($18.3 million, net of taxes). All remaining contingencies related to our insurance claims have been resolved. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES) Other income (expenses) includes net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) of consolidated sponsored investment products, investment and other income, and interest expense. Investment and other income is comprised primarily of dividends, interest income and realized gains and losses from investments, income from investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, minority interest expense, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Net other income increased to $63.0 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to $52.1 million in fiscal 2003 due to higher net investment gains related to consolidated sponsored investment products and higher dividends, interest, net realized gains and equity method income from our investments. The increase was partially offset by higher interest expense related to the issuance of five year senior notes in April 2003 and minority interest expense related to the consolidated sponsored investment products. Net other income was $52.1 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to a net expense of $7.2 million in fiscal 2002 due to a $60.1 million other than temporary decline in value of some of our investments recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. TAXES ON INCOME As a multi national corporation, we provide investment management services to a wide range of international investment products, often managed from locations outside the United States. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the United States. The mix of pre tax income (primarily from our investment management business) subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the United States, produces a lower overall effective tax rate than existing U.S. Federal and state tax rates. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2004 increased to 29% compared to 28% in fiscal 2003 and 25% in fiscal 2002. The effective tax rate 40 will continue to reflect the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income, as well as other factors. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity, and sources and uses of capital: (in millions) AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 2003 2002 BALANCE SHEET DATA Assets Liquid assets $4,279.3 $3,272.3 $2,826.0 Cash and cash equivalents 2,917.2 1,053.7 980.6 Liabilities Commercial paper $170.0 $ $ Convertible Notes 530.1 520.3 514.2 Medium Term Notes 420.0 420.0 Other long term debt 246.3 168.6 81.0 Total debt 1,372.4 1,123.7 611.5 CASH FLOW DATA Operating cash flows $943.4 $536.4 $735.2 Investing cash flows 941.7 (259.8) (215.1) Financing cash flows (21.6) (203.5) (135.7) Liquid assets, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments (trading and available for sale) and current receivables, increased from fiscal 2003, primarily due to cash provided by operating activities. Cash and cash equivalents include cash, debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash, including money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents increased in fiscal 2004 as we held a larger portion of liquid assets in debt instruments, primarily term deposits, with maturities of three months or less from the purchase date, resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in investment securities, available for sale. The increase in total debt outstanding from September 30, 2003 relates to $170.0 million of commercial paper issued in September 2004 to purchase the assets of a lessor trust that held our corporate headquarter campus. The lessor trust had previously been consolidated in our financial statements in December 2003 in accordance with the guidance of FIN 46 R. In addition, other long term debt increased as our long term financing liability recognized in relation to U.S. DCA financed by LFL, has increased in fiscal 2004, as LFL has not sold any U.S. DCA in a securitization transaction since fiscal 2002. The increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2004 included $706.7 million in net income and $215.5 million in proceeds from the securitization of loans held for sale, net of originations. The increase in investing cash flows in fiscal 2004 related primarily to excess liquidations of investments over purchases of $1,061.2 million. Financing activities in fiscal 2004 included the issuance of $170.0 million of commercial paper and $128.9 million in common stock option exercises. In addition, during the year ended September 30, 2004, we purchased and retired 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $67.6 million. At September 30, 2004, approximately 13.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under board authorizations. We purchased and retired 15.3 million shares at a cost of $580.6 million, and 3.7 million shares at a cost of $115.9 million in the years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002. 41 CAPITAL RESOURCES We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under current credit facilities, the ability to issue debt or equity securities, and mutual fund sales commission financing arrangements. In particular, we expect to finance future investment in our banking/finance activities through operating cash flows, debt, increased deposit base, and through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities. As of September 30, 2004, we had $300.0 million of debt and equity securities available to be issued under shelf registration statements filed with the SEC and $330.0 million of additional commercial paper available for issuance. Our committed revolving credit facilities at September 30, 2004 totaled $420.0 million, of which, $210.0 million was under a 364 day facility expiring in June 2005. The remaining $210.0 million facility is under a five year facility that will expire in June 2007. In addition, at September 30, 2004, our banking/finance operating segment had $523.6 million in available uncommitted short term bank lines under the Federal Reserve Funds system, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window, and Federal Home Loan Bank short term borrowing capacity. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. In extreme circumstances, we might not be able to access this liquidity readily. Our investment management segment finances Class B and certain Class C DCA arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations through LFL, a company in which we have a 49% ownership interest. Class B and C sales commissions that we have financed globally through LFL during fiscal 2004, were approximately $163.4 million compared to $161.3 million in fiscal 2003. LFLs ability to access credit facilities and the securitization market will directly affect our existing financing arrangements. Our banking/finance operating segment finances its automotive lending activities through operational cash flows, inter segment loans and by selling its auto loans in securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors. Beginning in fiscal 2005, automotive lending activities may also be financed by issuing auto loan backed variable funding notes to institutional investors, and as a result, we expect that inter segment lending activities may decrease. Gross sale proceeds from auto loan securitization transactions were $488.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $464.4 million in fiscal 2003. Our ability to access the securitization market will directly affect our plans to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future. USES OF CAPITAL We expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business, make strategic acquisitions, acquire shares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay shareholder dividends and repay and service debt. In May 2001, we received approximately $490.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of $877.0 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2031 (the "Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes, which were offered to qualified institutional buyers only, carry an interest rate of 1.875% per annum, with an initial conversion premium of 43%. Each of the $1,000 (principal amount at maturity) Convertible Notes is convertible into 9.3604 shares of our common stock, when the price of our stock reaches certain thresholds. To date, we have repurchased Convertible Notes with a face value of $5.9 million principal amount at maturity, for their accreted value of $3.5 million, in cash. We may redeem the remaining Convertible Notes for cash on or after May 11, 2006 or make additional repurchases, at the option of the holders, on May 11 of 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 and 2026. In this event, we may choose to pay the accreted value of the Convertible Notes in cash or shares of our common stock. The amount that the holders may redeem in the future will depend on, among other factors, the performance of our common stock. 42 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2004. We believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments thorough existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities. (in millions) PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN 1 MORE THAN 5 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS TOTAL YEAR 1 3 YEARS 3 5 YEARS YEARS Non current debt $1,196.4 $35.0 $72.0 $494.7 $594.7 Operating leases /1 271.6 29.9 55.7 47.0 139.0 Purchase obligations /2 407.7 119.3 108.7 71.4 108.3 Loan origination commitments 242.4 216.4 26.0 Defined benefit plan obligation /3 18.6 18.6 Capital contribution commitments /4 7.3 4.9 2.4 TOTAL $2,144.0 $424.1 $238.8 $613.1 $868.0 /1 Operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements totaling $44.3 million as of September 30, 2004. /2 Purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be cancelled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees. In particular, under an agreement to outsource management of our data center and distributed server operations that we can terminate any time after July 1, 2006, we estimate that the termination fee payable in July 2006, not including costs associated with assuming equipment leases, would approximate $14.3 million and would decrease each month for the subsequent two years, reaching a payment of approximately $2.2 million in July 2008. /3 Defined benefit plan obligation relates to our expected contribution to a noncontributory retirement plan and a nonqualified supplemental plan that will be made when the final approval of the noncontributory retirement plan termination is received from the Internal Revenue Service. /4 Capital contribution commitments relate to our contractual commitments to fund certain of our sponsored investment products. CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS In relation to the auto loan securitization transactions that we have entered into with a number of qualified special purpose entities, we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to the holders of the notes up to certain levels as specified under the related agreements. As of September 30, 2004, the maximum potential amount of future payments was $23.6 million relating to guarantees made prior to January 1, 2003. In addition, our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2004 included a $0.6 million liability to reflect obligations arising from auto securitization transactions subsequent to December 31, 2002. At September 30, 2004, the banking/finance operating segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling $2.5 million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers, primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers. These standby letters of credit, issued prior to January 1, 2003, were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of $2.1 million as of September 30, 2004 and commercial real estate. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As discussed above, we obtain financing for sales commissions that we pay to broker/dealers on Class B and certain Class C shares through LFL, a company established in Ireland to provide DCA financing. We hold a 49% ownership interest in LFL and we account for this ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Our exposure to loss related to our investment in LFL is limited to the carrying value of our investment and loans, and interest and fees receivable from LFL. At September 30, 2004, those amounts approximated $53.2 million. During fiscal 2004, we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately $1.8 million for our share of its net loss over this period. 43 As discussed above, our banking/finance operating segment periodically enters into auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors. Our main objective in entering in securitization transactions is to obtain financing for auto loan activities. Securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled $768.9 million at September 30, 2004 and $680.7 million at September 30, 2003. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our accounting policies. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At September 30, 2004 our assets included intangible assets as follows: (in millions) NET CARRYING AMOUNT Goodwill $1,381.8 Intangible assets definite lived 191.7 Intangible assets indefinite lived 479.8 TOTAL $2,053.3 We make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangibles in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of intangibles on an ongoing basis. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles when there is an indication of impairment, or at least once a year. Goodwill impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, calculated based on anticipated discounted cash flows. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment on the basis of the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows, without interest charges, to be derived from these assets. We review definite lived intangible assets for impairment when there is an indication of impairment, or at least once a year. During the quarter ended March 31, 2004, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of October 1, 2003. In performing our analysis, we used certain assumptions and estimates including those related to discount rates and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets, based on, among other factors, historical trends and the characteristics of the assets. While we believe that our testing was appropriate, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense. INCOME TAXES As a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the United States. As of September 30, 2004, and based on tax laws in effect as of this date, it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we have not made a provision for U.S. taxes and have not recorded a deferred tax liability on $2.5 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings recorded by 44 foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2004. Changes to our policy of reinvesting foreign earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operation. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law on October 22, 2004. Under a provision of the Act, we may elect to repatriate certain earnings of our foreign based subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate in either of our fiscal years ending September 30, 2005 or September 30, 2006. We are currently evaluating the effect of this repatriation provision; however, we do not expect to complete this evaluation until after the U.S. Congress or the U.S. Department of the Treasury issue additional guidance regarding this provision. The range of possible amounts we are considering for repatriation is between zero and $1.9 billion and the potential range of income tax associated with amounts subject to the reduced rate is between zero and $117.0 million. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS We record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Where available, we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information. However, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For example, we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold, and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value. We evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time. As most of our investments are carried at fair value, if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist, the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income, in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined. In fiscal 2002, we recognized $60.1 million for an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments. We classify securities as trading when it is managements intent at the time of purchase to sell the security within a short period of time. Accordingly, we record unrealized gains and losses on these securities in our consolidated income. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements. LOSS CONTINGENCIES We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claim based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2004 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from these matters. See also "Legal Proceedings" included in Part I, Item 3 of this report and "Risk Factors" below. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES Under FIN 46 R, a variable interest entity ("VIE") is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. FIN 46 R requires consolidation of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. Evaluating whether related entities are VIEs and determining if we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, is highly complex and involves the use of estimates and assumptions. To determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of each VIE, we performed an expected cash flow analysis using certain discount rate and volatility assumptions based on available historical information and managements estimates. Based on our analysis, we did not consolidate any VIEs in our financial statements as of September 30, 2004. While we believe that our testing and approach were appropriate, future changes in estimates and assumptions may affect our decision and lead to the consolidation of one or more VIEs in our financial statements. 45 IMPACT OF INFLATION Our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes are presented in historical dollars without considering the effect of inflation. Since a significant portion of our assets are liquid in nature, the potential effect of inflation is mitigated. In addition, the majority of our revenues and related expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, a currency that has not been significantly affected by the impact of changes in prices in recent years. To the extent that a potential rise in inflation may affect the securities and the consumer lending markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operation in the future. BANKING/FINANCE GROUP INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN ANALYSIS The following table presents the banking/finance operating segments net interest income and margin for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) AVERAGE INTEREST AVERAGE AVERAGE INTEREST AVERAGE AVERAGE INTEREST AVERAGE BALANCE RATE BALANCE RATE BALANCE RATE Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell $32.1 $0.3 0.93% $59.8 $0.9 1.51% $91.5 $1.4 1.53% Investment securities, available for sale 321.4 11.0 3.42% 421.3 18.2 4.32% 368.7 18.4 4.99% Loans to banking clients /1 451.3 27.7 6.14% 460.3 30.4 6.60% 490.7 33.5 6.83% Total earning assets $804.8 $39.0 4.85% $941.4 $49.5 5.26% $950.9 $53.3 5.61% Interest bearing deposits $597.5 $4.3 0.72% $692.8 $6.4 0.92% $814.2 $9.8 1.20% Inter segment debt 88.2 1.4 1.59% 121.5 2.5 2.06% 150.6 5.4 3.59% Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 15.6 0.2 1.28% 20.8 0.3 1.44% 19.2 0.4 2.08% Total interest bearing liabilities $701.3 $5.9 0.84% $835.1 $9.2 1.10% $984.0 $15.6 1.59% Net interest income and margin $33.1 4.11% $40.3 4.28% $37.7 3.96% /1 Non accrual loans are included in the average loans receivable balance. 46 QUARTERLY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (in thousands except per share data) QUARTER FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH 2004 Operating revenues $809,666 $878,995 $867,815 $881,732 Operating income $222,860 $225,210 $240,986 $241,769 Net income $172,296 $172,791 $173,896 $187,681 Earnings per share Basic $0.70 $0.69 $0.70 $0.75 Diluted $0.69 $0.68 $0.69 $0.74 Dividend per share $0.085 $0.085 $0.085 $0.085 Common stock price per share High $52.25 $62.10 $57.81 $56.47 Low $43.39 $52.02 $48.10 $46.85 2003 Operating revenues $606,836 $614,711 $685,949 $724,628 Operating income $139,455 $139,706 $169,375 $199,540 Net income $109,760 $109,603 $131,388 $152,079 Earnings per share Basic $0.43 $0.43 $0.52 $0.61 Diluted $0.43 $0.43 $0.52 $0.61 Dividend per share $0.075 $0.075 $0.075 $0.075 Common stock price per share High $37.85 $37.01 $40.85 $46.95 Low $27.90 $29.99 $32.84 $38.66 2002 Operating revenues $619,211 $627,010 $667,150 $609,488 Operating income $142,865 $148,019 $153,852 $140,766 Net income $118,519 $119,996 $125,690 $68,518 Earnings per share Basic $0.45 $0.46 $0.48 $0.26 Diluted $0.45 $0.46 $0.48 $0.26 Dividend per share $0.070 $0.070 $0.070 $0.070 Common stock price per share High $37.85 $44.15 $44.48 $43.15 Low $30.85 $34.52 $39.45 $29.52 RISK FACTORS WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS AND SOMETIMES LARGER COMPANIES. We compete with numerous investment management companies, stock brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions. Continuing consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own. Additionally, competing securities broker/dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products, which could limit the distribution of our investment products. To the extent that existing or potential customers, including securities broker/dealers, decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and net income could decline. 47 CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS ON WHICH WE DEPEND COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND HINDER OUR GROWTH. We derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker/dealers and other similar investment advisers. Increasing competition for these distribution channels and recent regulatory initiatives, have caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future. Higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings. Additionally, if one of the major financial advisers who distribute our products were to cease their operations, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings. Moreover, our failure to maintain strong business relationships with these advisers would impair our ability to distribute and sell our products, which would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management, related revenues and overall business and financial condition. WE HAVE BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASED RISK OF VOLATILITY OF THE ASSETS WE MANAGE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL AND EQUITY MARKETS. We have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets due to the continuing threat of terrorism. Declines in these markets have caused in the past, and would cause in the future, a decline in our revenue and income. THE LEVELS OF OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, WHICH IMPACT REVENUES, ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. Global economic conditions, changes in the equity market place, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix, market values and levels of our assets under management. Changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income, since we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage. Similarly, our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation, including economic and credit market downturns. WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN NUMEROUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. We sell mutual funds and offer investment advisory and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally. Regulators in these jurisdictions could change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets. OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE WIDELY VARIED BUSINESS LINES CAN BE IMPEDED BY SYSTEMS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. Our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business both domestically and abroad, depends on our ability to integrate the varied accounting, financial, information and operational systems of our various businesses on a global basis. OUR INABILITY TO MEET CASH NEEDS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. Our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value, our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock. Similarly, our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables, and to obtain continued financing for certain Class C shares, is also subject to the markets perception of those assets, finance rates offered by competitors, and the general market for private debt. If we are unable to obtain these funds and financing, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans. CERTAIN OF THE PORTFOLIOS WE MANAGE, INCLUDING OUR EMERGING MARKET PORTFOLIOS, AND RELATED REVENUES ARE VULNERABLE TO MARKET SPECIFIC POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC RISKS. Our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental polices, expropriation, nationalization, asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership. Foreign trading markets, particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than the U.S. and other established markets. DIVERSE AND STRONG COMPETITION LIMITS THE INTEREST RATES THAT WE CAN CHARGE ON CONSUMER LOANS. We compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans, which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales or in some cases zero interest rates. Our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business. Economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans, which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase. 48 WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATION. Upon completion of our acquisition of Fiduciary Trust in April 2001, we became a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board (the "FRB"). We are subject to the restrictions, limitations, or prohibitions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. The FRB may impose additional limitations or restrictions on our activities, including if the FRB believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition. TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING RISK AND LIMITATIONS COULD CONSTRAIN OUR OPERATIONS. We are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology, operating systems and premises. Although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third party failures, which could negatively impact our operations. GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, SETTLEMENTS OF SUCH INVESTIGATIONS, ONGOING AND PROPOSED GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, AND REGULATORY EXAMINATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS CIVIL LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO SUCH MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCREASE COSTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS. As part of various investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, the New York Attorney General, the California Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Florida Department of Financial Services and the Commissioner of Securities, the West Virginia Attorney General, the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities, and Health Care Administration and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (as used in this section, together, the "Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and employees of the Company, received requests for information and or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company and its current employees provided documents and information in response to these requests and subpoenas. In addition, the Company responded, and in one instance is currently responding, to requests for similar kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of the foreign countries where the Company conducts its global asset management business. Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. ("FTIC"), a Company subsidiary and the investment manager of Franklin Templetons Canadian mutual Funds, has been cooperating with and responding to requests for information from the Ontario Securities Commission (the "OSC") relating to the OSCs review of frequent trading practices within the Canadian mutual fund industry. On December 10, 2004, FTIC received a letter indicating that the staff of the OSC is contemplating enforcement proceedings against FTIC before the OSC. In its letter, the OSC staff expressed the view that, over the period of February 1999 to February 2003, there were certain accounts that engaged in a frequent trading market timing strategy in certain funds being managed by FTIC. The letter also gave FTIC the opportunity to respond to the issues raised in the letter and to provide the OSC staff with additional information relevant to these matters. The Company expects to enter into discussions with the OSC staff in an effort to resolve the issues raised in the OSCs review. The Company cannot predict the likelihood of whether those discussions will result in a settlement, or the terms of any such settlement. On December 9, 2004, the staff of the NASD informed the Company that it has made a preliminary determination to recommend a disciplinary proceeding against Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI"), alleging that FTDI violated certain NASD rules by the use of directed brokerage commissions to pay for sales and marketing support. FTDI has also received a separate letter from the NASD staff advising FTDI of the NASD staffs preliminary determination to recommend a disciplinary proceeding against FTDI alleging violation of certain NASD rules relating to FTDIs Top Producers program. The Company believes that any such charges are unwarranted. On August 2, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that its subsidiary, Franklin Advisers, Inc. ("Franklin Advisers") reached an agreement with the SEC that resolved the issues resulting from the previously disclosed SEC investigation into market timing activity. In connection with that agreement, the SEC issued an "Order instituting administrative and cease and desist proceedings pursuant to sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, making findings and imposing remedial sanctions and a cease and desist order" (the "Order"). The SECs Order 49 concerned the activities of a limited number of third parties that ended in 2000 and those that were the subject of the first Massachusetts administrative complaint described below. Under the terms of the SECs Order, pursuant to which Franklin Advisers neither admitted nor denied any of the findings contained therein, Franklin Advisers agreed to pay $50 million to be distributed to shareholders of certain of the Franklin Templeton mutual funds ("Funds"), of which $20 million was a civil penalty. The settlement was provided for as part of a charge of $60 million ($45.6 million, net of taxes) recorded in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004. This charge represented the Companys estimate of the anticipated settlement and related legal and distribution costs. The Order required Franklin Advisers to, among other things: * Enhance and periodically review compliance policies and procedures, and establish a corporate ombudsman; * Establish a new internal position whose responsibilities shall include compliance matters related to conflicts of interests; and * Retain an Independent Distribution Consultant to develop a plan to distribute the $50 million settlement to Fund shareholders. The Order further provided that in any related investor actions, Franklin Advisers would not benefit from any offset or reduction of any investors claim by the amount of any distribution from the above described $50 million to such investor that is proportionately attributable to the civil penalty paid by Franklin Advisers. On September 20, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that two of its subsidiaries, Franklin Advisers, Inc. and Franklin Templeton Alternative Strategies, Inc. ("FTAS"), reached an agreement with the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "State of Massachusetts") related to the previously disclosed administrative complaint filed on February 4, 2004. The administrative complaint concerned one instance of market timing that was also a subject of the August 2, 2004 settlement that Franklin Advisers reached with the SEC, as described above. Under the terms of the settlement consent order issued by the State of Massachusetts, Franklin Advisers and FTAS consented to the entry of a cease and desist order and agreed to pay a $5 million administrative fine to the State of Massachusetts (the "Massachusetts Consent Order"). Franklin Resources, Inc. recorded this expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The Massachusetts Consent Order included two different sections: "Statements of Fact" and "Violations of Massachusetts Securities Laws." Franklin Advisers and FTAS admitted the facts in the Statements of Fact. On October 25, 2004, the State of Massachusetts filed a second administrative complaint, alleging that Franklin Resources, Inc.s Form 8 K filing (in which it described the Massachusetts Consent Order and stated that "Franklin did not admit or deny engaging in any wrongdoing") failed to state that Franklin Advisers and FTAS admitted the Statements of Fact portion of the Massachusetts Consent Order (the "Second Complaint"). Franklin Resources, Inc. reached a second agreement with the State of Massachusetts on November 19, 2004, resolving the Second Complaint. As a result of the November 19, 2004 settlement, Franklin Resources, Inc. filed a new Form 8 K. The terms of the original settlement did not change and there was no monetary fine associated with this second settlement. On November 17, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that FTDI reached an agreement with the CAGO, resolving the issues resulting from the CAGOs investigation concerning sales and marketing support payments. The Company believes that the settlement of the CAGO matter is in the best interest of the Company and its Fund shareholders. Under the terms of the settlement, FTDI neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the CAGOs complaint and agreed to pay $2 million as a civil penalty, $14 million to Franklin Templeton funds and $2 million to the CAGO for its investigative costs. As a result of the CAGO settlement, the results for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 announced on October 28, 2004 were adjusted to include an additional charge to income of $18.5 million ($12.2 million, net of tax). This adjustment was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require the Company to update estimates when additional information becomes available after the end of the reporting period but prior to the issuance of the financial statements with respect to loss contingencies that existed as of the date of the financial statements. 50 On December 13, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that its subsidiaries FTDI and Franklin Advisers reached an agreement with the SEC, resolving the issues resulting from the SECs investigation concerning marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell Fund shares. In connection with that agreement, the SEC issued an "Order Instituting Administrative and Cease and Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Order"). The Company believes that the settlement of this matter is in the best interest of the Company and its Fund shareholders. Under the terms of the Order, in which FTDI and Franklin Advisers neither admitted nor denied the findings contained therein, they agreed to pay the Funds a penalty of $20 million and $1 in disgorgement. FTDI and Franklin Advisers also agreed to implement certain measures and undertakings relating to marketing support payments to broker dealers for the promotion or sale of Fund shares, including making additional disclosures in the Funds Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information. The Order further requires the appointment of an independent distribution consultant, at the Companys expense, who shall develop a plan for the distribution of the penalty and disgorgement to the Funds. A charge of $21.5 million ($17.3 million, net of taxes) was recorded by the Company in its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 related to this matter. INTERNAL INQUIRIES. The Company also conducted its own internal fact finding inquiry with the assistance of outside counsel to determine whether any Fund shareholders, including Company employees, were permitted to engage in late trading or in market timing transactions contrary to the policies of the affected Fund and, if so, the circumstances and persons involved. The Companys internal inquiry regarding market timing and late trading is complete. We did not find any late trading, though we identified various instances of frequent trading. One officer of a subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. was placed on administrative leave and subsequently resigned from his position with the Company in December 2003. We found no instances of inappropriate mutual fund trading by any portfolio manager, investment analyst or officer of Franklin Resources, Inc. As previously disclosed, the Company identified some instances of frequent trading in shares of certain Funds by a few current or former employees in their personal 401(k) plan accounts. These individuals included one trader and one officer of the Funds. Pending our further inquiry, these two individuals were placed on administrative leave and the officer resigned from his positions with the Funds. The independent directors of the Funds and the Company also retained independent outside counsel to review these matters and to report their findings and recommendations. Based on independent counsels findings and recommendations, the Company reinstated the trader. The independent counsel concluded that some instances of the former Fund officers trading violated Company policy, and the Company was prepared to institute appropriate disciplinary action. Subsequently, the former Fund officer resigned from his employment with the Company. The Company does not believe there were any losses to the Funds as a result of this trading. CLASS ACTION AND OTHER LAWSUITS. The Company has been named in shareholder class and other actions related to some of the matters described above. See "Legal Proceedings" included in Part I, Item 3 of this report. Management believes that the claims made in the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. It is possible that the Company may be named in additional similar civil actions related to some of the matters described above. REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS AND REFORMS, PARTICULARLY THOSE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCREASE COSTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS. Pending regulatory and legislative actions and reforms affecting the mutual fund industry may significantly increase the Companys costs of doing business and or negatively impact its revenues, either of which could have a material negative impact on the Companys financial results. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk: the potential loss due to changes in the value of investments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange and or equity prices. Management is responsible for managing this risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks. 51 Our banking/finance operating segment is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its loans receivable, debt securities held, and deposit liabilities. In our banking/finance operating segment, we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources. In addition, as of September 30, 2004, we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking/finance operating segment balances, individually and collectively, of a 100 basis point (1%) movement in market interest rates. Based on our analysis, we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario. Our investment management operating segment is exposed to changes in interest rates through its investment in debt securities and its outstanding debt. We minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities, and through diversification. Our exposure to interest rate changes related to our debt issuances is not material since a significant percentage of our outstanding debt is at fixed interest rates. We are subject to foreign exchange risk through our foreign operations. We operate primarily in the United States, but also provide services and earn revenues in Canada, the Bahamas, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimized since a significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the United States. We are exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that are carried at fair value and through investments held by majority owned sponsored investment products that we consolidate. To mitigate this risk, we maintain a diversified investment portfolio. Our exposure to equity price fluctuations is also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions. 52
