Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Statements In this section, we discuss and analyze our results of operations and our financial condition. In addition to historical information, we also make some statements relating to the future, called forward looking statements, which are provided under the safe harbor protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are generally written in the future tense and or are preceded by words such as will, may, should, could, expect, suggest, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, or other similar words. These forward looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. You should carefully review the Risk Factors section set forth below, in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in any more recent filings with the U. S. Securities and Exchange 41 Table of Contents Commission (the SEC), which describes these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail. We undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview Many of our key performance measures including net income and earnings per share continued to improve in fiscal year 2005, as compared to fiscal year 2004. In part, we attribute these improvements to our continued focus on diversifying our client base and product offerings. This diversification, along with the overall increases in many foreign equity markets and to a lesser extent the U. S. markets, has led to increases in our assets under management driven from both market appreciation and positive net flows into our sponsored investment products. We continually evaluate our business from the standpoint of profitability, product performance and client service, among other things, in light of our long term strategies. Our strategies of expanding our assets under management and related operations internationally, continually seeking positive investment performance, protecting and furthering our brand recognition, developing and maintaining broker/dealer and client loyalties, providing a high level of customer service and closely monitoring costs, while also developing our human capital base and our systems and technology, and growing our investment management services all continue as objectives in the context of uncertain global market conditions. General We derive the majority of our operating revenues, operating expenses and net income from providing investment management, fund administration, shareholder services, transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services (collectively investment management and related services) to retail mutual funds, institutional accounts, high net worth clients, private accounts and other investment products. This is our primary business activity and operating segment. The mutual funds and other products that we serve, collectively called our sponsored investment products, are distributed to the public globally under six distinct names: Franklin Templeton Mutual Series Bissett Fiduciary Trust Darby Overseas Our sponsored investment products include a broad range of global/international equity, domestic (U.S.) equity, hybrid, fixed income and money market mutual funds, and other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management. To a lesser degree, our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. Our secondary business and operating segment is banking/finance. Our banking/finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals, foundations and institutions, and consumer 42 Table of Contents lending services. Our consumer lending activities include automotive lending related to the purchase, securitization, and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships, consumer credit and debit cards, real estate equity lines, and home equity/mortgage lending. Results of Operations (in millions except per share data) Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 2005vs. 2004 2004vs. 2003 Net Income $ 1,057.6 $ 706.7 $ 502.8 50 % 41 % Earnings Per Common Share Basic $ 4.22 $ 2.84 $ 1.98 49 % 43 % Diluted 4.06 2.75 1.95 48 % 41 % Operating Margin 30 % 27 % 25 % Net income increased by 50% and diluted earnings per share increased by 48% in fiscal year 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher fees for providing investment management and fund administration services (investment management fees) and underwriting and distribution fees consistent with a 21% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management and higher gross sales on which commissions are earned. In addition, we experienced a lower effective tax rate and a lower net charge to our provision for governmental investigations, proceedings and actions. The resulting increase in net income was partially offset by higher underwriting and distribution, and compensation and benefits expenses. The increase in diluted earnings per share in fiscal year 2005 was due to higher net income, partially offset by the effect of an increase in diluted weighted average shares outstanding to 262.6 million in fiscal year 2005 from 260.3 million in fiscal year 2004, as the increase in diluted weighted average shares from the assumed conversion of stock options granted was greater than stock repurchases during fiscal year 2005. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased by 41% in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to higher operating revenues consistent with a 26% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management, higher gross sales on which commissions are earned and an increase in billable shareholder accounts. These increases were partially offset by higher underwriting and distribution expenses, higher compensation and benefit expense, the provision for governmental investigations, proceedings and actions and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2004 as compared with the prior year. The decline in diluted weighted average shares outstanding to 260.3 million in fiscal year 2004 from 262.8 million in fiscal year 2003, also contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per common share. The decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding resulted from stock repurchases, especially in the latter half of fiscal year 2003, partially offset by an increase in dilution from the assumed conversion of stock options granted as the price of our common stock increased during fiscal year 2004. We restated diluted earnings per common share and diluted average shares outstanding for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 to reflect the adoption of the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share. 43 Table of Contents Assets Under Management (in billions) As of September 30, 2005 2004 2003 2005vs. 2004 2004vs. 2003 Equity Global/international $ 185.7 $ 132.9 $ 99.8 40 % 33 % Domestic (U.S.) 77.9 66.4 55.4 17 % 20 % Total equity 263.6 199.3 155.2 32 % 28 % Hybrid 78.4 59.0 45.8 33 % 29 % Fixed Income Tax free 53.8 51.3 52.2 5 % (2 )% Taxable Domestic (U.S.) 32.7 31.3 31.1 4 % 1 % Global/international 18.7 14.2 11.8 32 % 20 % Total fixed income 105.2 96.8 95.1 9 % 2 % Money Market 5.9 6.8 5.8 (13 )% 17 % Total $ 453.1 $ 361.9 $ 301.9 25 % 20 % Simple Monthly Average for the Year1 $ 410.8 $ 340.2 $ 269.8 21 % 26 % 1 Investment management fees from approximately 53% of our assets under management at September 30, 2005 were calculated using daily average assets under management. Our assets under management at September 30, 2005 were $453.1 billion, 25% higher than they were a year ago, due to excess sales over redemptions of $36.0 billion and market appreciation of $57.6 billion during fiscal year 2005. Simple monthly average assets under management, which are generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management and fund administration services (investment management services) than the year over year change in ending assets under management, increased 21% during fiscal year 2005. The simple monthly average mix of assets under management for the last three fiscal years is shown below. Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 Equity 57 % 54 % 49 % Hybrid 17 % 16 % 15 % Fixed income 25 % 28 % 34 % Money market 1 % 2 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 44 Table of Contents The following table presents industry data showing average effective management fee rates1 for the last three fiscal years. The data was obtained from Lipper&reg; Inc. and our actual effective fee rates may vary from these rates.

Management fees include fees earned from providing investment management services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity products are not included. For fiscal year 2005, our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management) increased to 0.598% from 0.579% in fiscal year 2004. The change in the mix of assets under management, resulting from higher excess sales over redemptions, greater appreciation for equity and hybrid as compared to fixed income products, and an increase in performance fees, led to the increase in our effective investment management fee rate. Generally, investment management fees earned on equity and hybrid products are higher than fees earned on fixed income products. For fiscal year 2004, our effective investment management fee rate increased to 0.579% from 0.551% in fiscal year 2003. The change in the mix of assets under management, resulting from higher excess sales over redemptions and appreciation for equity as compared to fixed income products, led to the increase in the effective investment management fee rate. Assets under management by sales region were as follows: (in billions) As of September 30, 2005 % of Total 2004 % of Total United States $ 324.0 72 % $ 265.3 73 % Canada 33.9 7 % 25.8 7 % Europe 46.4 10 % 29.5 8 % Asia/Pacific and other1 48.8 11 % 41.3 12 % Total $ 453.1 100 % $ 361.9 100 % 1 Includes multi jurisdictional assets under management. Approximately 72% of our assets under management at September 30, 2005 originated from our U.S. sales region and approximately 67% of our operating revenues originated in the United States in fiscal year 2005. Due to the global nature of our business operations, investment management and related services may be performed in locations unrelated to the sales region. 45 Table of Contents Components of the change in our assets under management and the percentage change in these components for the last three fiscal years were as follows: (in billions) Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs.2004 2004 vs.2003 Beginning assets under management $ 361.9 $ 301.9 $ 247.8 20 % 22 % Sales 122.5 96.8 81.3 27 % 19 % Reinvested distributions 8.3 4.9 3.7 69 % 32 % Redemptions (86.5 ) (74.4 ) (66.9 ) 16 % 11 % Distributions (10.8 ) (7.1 ) (6.0 ) 52 % 18 % Acquisitions 0.1 0.9 (89 %) N/A Appreciation 57.6 38.9 42.0 48 % (7 %) Ending Assets Under Management $ 453.1 $ 361.9 $ 301.9 25 % 20 % Excess sales over redemptions were $36.0 billion in fiscal year 2005 as compared to $22.4 billion in fiscal year 2004 and $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2003. Gross product sales increased 27% while redemptions increased 16% in fiscal year 2005. The acquisition of Darby Overseas Investments, Ltd. and Darby Overseas Partners, L.P. (collectively Darby Overseas) added $0.9 billion in assets under management related to private equity, mezzanine and emerging markets fixed income products as of the acquisition date, on October 1, 2003. The acquisition of the general partner of the Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Emerging Europe Fund, L.P., a private equity fund focused on Central and Eastern Europe, added $0.1 billion in assets under management as of the acquisition date, on January 1, 2005. Our products experienced $57.6 billion in appreciation in fiscal year 2005, as compared to $38.9 and $42.0 billion in fiscal years 2004 and 2003. Operating Revenues The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2004 and between fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2003, and the percentage of total operating revenues that each revenue category represented for the last three fiscal years. Percentage Change Percentage of TotalOperating Revenues 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 2004 2003 Investment management fees 25 % 32 % 57 % 57 % 57 % Underwriting and distribution fees 33 % 35 % 36 % 34 % 32 % Shareholder servicing fees 4 % 12 % 6 % 7 % 8 % Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net 25 % 3,684 % Other, net (9 %) (8 %) 1 % 2 % 3 % Total Operating Revenues 25 % 31 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Investment Management Fees Investment management fees, accounting for 57% of our operating revenues in fiscal year 2005, include fees earned from providing investment management services. These fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products or clients as a percentage of the 46 Table of Contents market value of assets under management. Annual rates vary by investment objective and types of service provided. Investment management fees increased 25% in fiscal year 2005 consistent with a 21% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in asset mix toward equity and hybrid products, which generally carry higher investment management fees than fixed income products. Investment management fees increased 32% in fiscal year 2004 consistent with a 26% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in average asset mix toward equity products, which generally carry higher investment management fees than fixed income products. Underwriting and Distribution Fees We earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase. Sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts. Therefore, underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes. Many of our sponsored investment products pay distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. While other contractual arrangements exist in international jurisdictions, in the United States, distribution fees include 12b 1 fees. These fees are subject to maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund and other regulatory limitations. See Part I, Item I of this report for a description of U.S. underwriting and distribution fees by share class. We pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf. See the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below. Overall, underwriting and distribution fees increased 33% in fiscal year 2005. Underwriting fees increased 40% primarily due to a 27% increase in gross product sales along with a change in the sales mix. Distribution fees increased 29% consistent with a 21% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset and share class mix. Underwriting and distribution fees increased 35% in fiscal year 2004. Underwriting fees increased 33% primarily due to a 19% increase in gross product sales along with a change in the sales mix. Distribution fees increased 36% consistent with a 26% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset and share class mix. Shareholder Servicing Fees Shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some instances, sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management. We receive fees as compensation for providing varying levels of transfer agency services, including providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. In the United States, transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in 47 Table of Contents the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Shareholder servicing fees increased 4% in fiscal year 2005. The increase reflects a 7% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts, partially offset by a shift to shareholder accounts that are billable at a lower rate. Shareholder servicing fees increased 12% in fiscal year 2004. The increase reflects an 18% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts, primarily due to the overall increase in number of shareholder accounts billable under revised shareholder service fee agreements in the United States that became effective on January 1, 2003, partially offset by a decline in fee rates chargeable on accounts closed in the prior calendar year, under these agreements. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products Income, Net Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net reflects the net investment income, including dividends received, of sponsored investment products consolidated under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003) (FIN 46 R) and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries. The 25% increase in fiscal year 2005 reflects the fluctuation in timing and amounts of income earned by these sponsored investment products, while the 3,684% increase in fiscal year 2004 reflects primarily an increase in the number of products that have been consolidated in our results of operations. Other, Net Other, net consists primarily of revenues from the banking/finance operating segment as well as income from custody services. Revenues from the banking/finance operating segment include interest income on loans, servicing income, and investment income on banking/finance investment securities, and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for probable loan losses. Other, net decreased 9% in fiscal year 2005 due to lower realized gains on sales of automotive loans and an increase in interest expense related to our financing of the automotive lending program, partially offset by a decline in the provision for probable loan losses primarily related to our automotive portfolio. Other, net decreased 8% in fiscal year 2004 due to lower realized gains on sale of automotive loans and decreased interest income on investments, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for probable loan losses related to our consumer lending portfolio and lower interest expense. 48 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The table below presents the percentage change in each expense category between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2004 and between fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2003, and the percentage of total operating expenses that each expense category represented for the last three fiscal years. Percentage Change Percentage of TotalOperating Expenses 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 2004 2003 Underwriting and distribution 36 % 35 % 47 % 41 % 39 % Compensation and benefits 13 % 18 % 29 % 31 % 33 % Information systems, technology and occupancy 5 % (4 %) 9 % 11 % 14 % Advertising and promotion 23 % 21 % 4 % 4 % 4 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 24 % 35 % 4 % 4 % 4 % Amortization of intangible assets (1 %) 4 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Provision for governmental investigations, proceedings and actions, net (68 %) N/A 1 % 4 % N/A September 11, 2001 recovery, net (100 %) 588 % (1 %) Other 17 % 24 % 5 % 5 % 5 % Total Operating Expenses 21 % 26 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Underwriting and Distribution Underwriting and distribution includes expenses paid to financial advisers and other third parties for selling, distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products. Underwriting and distribution expenses increased 36% in fiscal year 2005 and 35% in fiscal year 2004 consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 13% during fiscal year 2005, primarily resulting from an increase in bonus expense under the Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, pursuant to which bonus awards have been made, based, in part, on our performance. In addition, we experienced increases related to the annual merit salary adjustments effective in October 2004, higher staffing levels and other employee benefits. Compensation and benefits increased 18% during fiscal year 2004, primarily resulting from an increase in bonus expense under the Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, our annual merit salary adjustments effective in October 2003 and additional compensation and benefit costs related to the acquisition of Darby Overseas in October 2003. We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue. We employed approximately 7,200 people at September 30, 2005 as compared to about 6,700 at September 30, 2004. 49 Table of Contents Information Systems, Technology and Occupancy Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased 5% in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to higher building costs related to global expansion and an increase in technology consulting and outside market data services. This increase was partially offset by a continued decrease in depreciation levels for equipment and software related to a decrease in purchases of information systems and technology equipment as certain of our technology equipment is periodically replaced with new equipment under our technology outsourcing agreement, and a decline in the number and scope of technology projects that have been completed and are therefore subject to amortization. Information systems, technology and occupancy costs decreased 4% in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to lower depreciation levels for equipment and software related to a decrease in purchases of information systems and technology equipment and the stabilization in the number and scope of new technology project initiatives. The decrease was partly offset by an increase in market data services and building depreciation. Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs, which exclude occupancy costs, were as follows for the last three fiscal years: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net carrying amount at beginning of period $ 51.3 $ 79.1 $ 121.5 Additions during period, net of disposals and other adjustments 21.3 16.3 25.8 Net assets added through acquisitions 0.3 Amortization during period (29.9 ) (44.4 ) (68.2 ) Net Carrying Amount at End of Period $ 42.7 $ 51.3 $ 79.1 Advertising and Promotion Advertising and promotion increased 23% in fiscal year 2005 due to an increase in direct advertising campaigns and marketing and promotion efforts globally. Advertising and promotion increased 21% in fiscal year 2004, due to the elimination of directed brokerage effective November 28, 2003 and higher expenditures on direct advertising campaigns and marketing materials. We are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and in order to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities, which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues. In addition to potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, advertising and promotion may also be impacted by changes in levels of sales and assets under management that affect marketing support payments made to the distributors of our sponsored investment products. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Certain fund share classes globally, including Class B in the United States, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders, although our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale. Furthermore, in the United States, Class A shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met and Class C shares have been sold without a front end sales charge since January 1, 2004. However, our U.S. distribution subsidiary pays a commission on these sales. We defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over 12 months to 8 years depending on share class or financing arrangements. 50 Table of Contents Class B and certain of our Class C deferred commission assets (DCA) arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations are financed through Lightning Finance Company Limited (LFL), a company in which we have a 49% ownership interest. LFL has entered into a financing agreement with our U.S. distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the DCA transferred to LFL until resold by LFL. As a result, we retain DCA sold to LFL under the U.S. agreement and a corresponding financing liability in our financial statements and amortize them over an 8 year period, or until sold by LFL to third parties. In contrast to the U.S. arrangement, LFL has entered into direct agreements with our Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and, as a result, we do not record DCA from these sources in our financial statements. The U.S. funds that had offered Class B shares ceased offering these shares to new investors and existing shareholders effective during the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Existing Class B shareholders may continue to exchange shares into Class B shares of different funds. Existing Class B shareholders may also continue to reinvest dividends in additional Class B shares. The cessation of purchases of Class B shares by new investors and existing shareholders may have a negative effect on the overall sales of the funds shares and cause a decrease in the levels of deferred commission amortization. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased 24% in fiscal year 2005 and 35% in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to increased gross product sales and because LFL did not sell any U.S. DCA in a securitization transaction in either year. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets decreased 1% in fiscal year 2005 and increased 4% in fiscal year 2004, primarily due to foreign currency movements in intangible assets not denominated in U.S. dollars. As of March 31, 2005, we completed our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of October 1, 2004. Provision for Governmental Investigations, Proceedings and Actions, Net In fiscal year 2005, we recognized charges to income aggregating to $42.0 million ($26.5 million, net of taxes) and we received $8.4 million from our insurance provider for certain legal costs associated with previously disclosed governmental investigations and litigation. In fiscal year 2004, we recognized charges to income of $105.0 million ($80.6 million, net of taxes), related to ongoing governmental investigations, proceedings and actions. September 11, 2001 Recovery, Net In January 2004, we received $32.5 million from our insurance carrier for claims related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that destroyed Fiduciary Trusts headquarters. These proceeds represented final recoveries for claims submitted to our insurance carrier. We realized a gain of $30.3 million ($18.3 million, net of taxes). All remaining contingencies related to our insurance claims have been resolved. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses consist primarily of professional fees, investment management and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, corporate travel and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses. 51 Table of Contents Other operating expenses increased 17% in fiscal year 2005, due primarily to an increase in investment management fees payable to external parties consistent with an increase in simple monthly average assets under management, higher corporate travel and entertainment, and higher professional fees including fees related to our compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules. Other operating expenses increased 24% in fiscal year 2004, due primarily to an increase in investment management fees payable to external parties consistent with an increase in simple monthly average assets under management, higher corporate travel and entertainment, and higher professional fees including costs related to governmental investigations, proceedings and actions. Other Income (Expenses) Other income (expenses) includes net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) of consolidated sponsored investment products, investment and other income, and interest expense. Investment and other income, net is comprised primarily of income related to our investments, including dividends, interest income, realized gains and losses and income from investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, as well as minority interest in less than wholly consolidated subsidiaries and investments, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expenses) increased 110% in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to higher net realized and unrealized investment gains by our consolidated sponsored investment products, net of related minority interest in less than wholly consolidated subsidiaries and investments, higher interest income from term deposits and debt securities, higher dividends from our sponsored investment products and higher equity method income from our investments. Other income (expenses) increased 21% in fiscal year 2004 due to higher net realized and unrealized investment gains by our consolidated sponsored investment products net of related minority interest in less than wholly consolidated subsidiaries and investments, as well as higher dividends, interest, net realized gains and equity method income from our investments. The increase was partially offset by higher interest expense related to the issuance of five year senior notes in April 2003. Taxes on Income As a multi national corporation, we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international investment products, often managed from locations outside the United States. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the United States. The mix of pre tax income (primarily from our investment management and related services business) subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the United States, produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing U.S. federal and state income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2005 decreased to 26%, as compared to 29% in 2004 and 28% in fiscal year 2003. Income taxes were provided at a reduced rate for fiscal year 2005 due primarily to a favorable state tax ruling, obtained in fiscal year 2005, which results in a refund of tax from multiple prior years. Going forward, the effective income tax rate will continue to reflect the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income, as well as other factors, including a reduction in our state tax liabilities due to the favorable state tax ruling which is in effect through fiscal year 2007. 52 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity, and sources and uses of capital: (in millions) As of and for the Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 Balance Sheet Data Assets Liquid assets $ 4,814.4 $ 4,279.3 $ 3,272.3 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,152.2 2,917.2 1,053.7 Liabilities Federal Home Loan Bank advances $ $ 6.0 $ Variable Funding Note 239.2 Commercial paper 169.4 169.6 Convertible Notes 540.1 530.1 520.3 Medium Term Notes 420.0 420.0 420.0 Other long term debt 248.3 246.3 168.6 Total debt 1,617.0 1,372.0 1,123.7 Cash Flow Data Operating cash flows $ 1,089.2 $ 929.7 $ 536.4 Investing cash flows (257.6 ) 841.4 (259.8 ) Financing cash flows (596.7 ) 92.4 (203.5 ) Liquid assets, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments (trading and available for sale) and current receivables, increased from September 30, 2004, primarily due to cash provided by operating activities. Cash and cash equivalents include cash, debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash, including money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents increased from September 30, 2004 as we invested operating cash flows in debt instruments, including term deposits, U.S. T bills and other interest bearing deposits, with maturities of three months or less from the purchase date. The increase in total debt outstanding from September 30, 2004 relates primarily to the issuance of a variable funding note (Variable Funding Note) payable under a one year revolving $250 million variable funding note warehouse credit facility secured by cash and or automobile loans, and the increase in the long term financing liability recognized in relation to U.S. DCA financed by LFL. We experienced higher operating cash flows in fiscal year 2005, as compared to fiscal year 2004, due to higher net income and an increase in other liabilities in fiscal year 2005, and an increase in trading securities, net in fiscal year 2004, partially offset by higher originations of loans held for sale in fiscal year 2005. In fiscal year 2005, we experienced net cash used in investing activities as compared to net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2004, due primarily to excess purchases of investments over liquidations and additions of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2005, as compared to fiscal year 2004, principally due to a special cash dividend that was declared on March 15, 2005 and paid on April 15, 2005 to holders of record of our common stock on March 31, 2005. The $2.00 per share special cash dividend returned $502.1 million to investors. Cash used in financing activities also increased as a result of repurchases of our common stock. In fiscal year 2005, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $170.1 million. At September 30, 2005, approximately 10.7 million shares remained available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase program. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $67.6 million in fiscal year 53 Table of Contents 2004, and 15.3 million shares at a cost of $580.6 million, including common stock repurchased under put option agreements, in fiscal year 2003. Capital Resources We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under current credit facilities, the ability to issue debt or equity securities, and mutual fund sales commission financing arrangements. In particular, we expect to finance future investment in our banking/finance activities through operating cash flows, debt, increased deposit base, and through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities. As of September 30, 2005, we had $300.0 million of debt and equity securities available to be issued under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and $330.0 million of additional commercial paper available for issuance. On June 10, 2005, we entered into a $420.0 million Five Year Facility Credit Agreement with certain banks and financial institutions. The Five Year Facility Credit Agreement replaced our $210.0 million 364 day revolving credit facility, which matured by its terms on June 2, 2005, and our $210.0 million five year revolving credit facility, which was terminated on June 10, 2005, prior to its scheduled expiration date of June 6, 2007. There were no amounts outstanding under either the former 364 day or the former five year credit facilities on the respective dates of termination and no early termination penalties were incurred by us. At September 30, 2005, the Five Year Facility Credit Agreement was undrawn and available. In addition, at September 30, 2005, our banking/finance operating segment had $345.0 million in available uncommitted short term bank lines under the Federal Reserve Funds system, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window, and Federal Home Loan Bank short term borrowing capacity. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. In extreme circumstances, we might not be able to access this liquidity readily. Our investment management and related services operating segment finances Class B and certain Class C DCA arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations through LFL, a company in which we have a 49% ownership interest. Class B and C sales commissions that we have financed globally through LFL during fiscal year 2005, were approximately $118.0 million compared to $163.4 million in fiscal year 2004. As noted above, the U.S. funds that had offered Class B shares ceased offering these shares to new investors and existing shareholders effective during the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Existing Class B shareholders may continue to exchange shares into Class B shares of different funds as well as reinvest dividends in additional Class B shares. As a result, we expect a continued decrease in DCA financed through LFL in future years. LFLs ability to access credit facilities and the securitization market will also directly affect our existing financing arrangements. Our banking/finance operating segment finances its automotive lending activities through operational cash flows, the issuance of notes under a variable funding note warehouse credit facility, inter segment loans and by selling its auto loans in securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors. Gross sale proceeds from auto loan securitization transactions were $231.6 million in fiscal year 2005 and $471.8 million in fiscal year 2004. As noted above, in March 2005, our subsidiary, Franklin Capital Corporation, entered into definitive agreements to create a new one year revolving $250.0 million variable funding note warehouse credit facility. Under these agreements, and through a special purpose statutory trust (the Trust), we issued the Variable Funding Note payable to certain administered conduits in the amount of up to $250.0 million. Security for the repayment of the Variable Funding Note consists of cash and or a pool of automobile loans 54 Table of Contents that meet certain eligibility requirements. Credit enhancements for the Variable Funding Note require us to provide as collateral loans held for sale with a fair value in excess of the value of the Variable Funding Note, as well as to hold in trust additional cash balances to cover certain shortfalls. In addition, we provide a payment provider commitment in an amount not to exceed 4.66% of the pool balance. Directly and through the Trust, we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk between the fixed interest rate on the pool of automobile loans and the floating interest rate being paid on the Variable Funding Note. In December 2005, we entered into an auto loan securitization transaction for the sale of loans held for sale with a carrying value of approximately $348.2 million, which included loans held by the Trust. Total pre tax gain recorded on this sale was approximately $0.9 million, including a gain on the interest rate swap, net of market gains already recognized in income during fiscal year 2005. Our ability to access the securitization and capital markets will directly affect our plans to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future. Uses of Capital We expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business, make strategic acquisitions, acquire shares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt. In May 2001, we received approximately $490.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of $877.0 million principal amount at maturity of Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2031 (Zero CouponSenior) (the Convertible Notes). The issue price of the Convertible Notes, which were offered to qualified institutional buyers only, represented a yield to maturity of 1.875% per annum excluding any contingent interest. Each of the $1,000 (principal amount at maturity) Convertible Notes will become convertible prior to maturity into 9.3604 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment) following the occurrence of certain specified triggering events. In particular, the Convertible Notes will become convertible if, during any calendar quarter, the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than a specified percentage (initially 120% as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2001 and declining 0.084% each quarter thereafter) of the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter. Based on this formula, the Convertible Notes were not convertible during the quarter ended September 30, 2005. However, holders may convert their Convertible Notes during the quarter ending December 31, 2005 because the closing sale price of our common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2005 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter was more than $78.34 (118.57% of $66.07, which was the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the quarter). At December 1, 2005, $1.2 million of these notes have been tendered for conversion. The Convertible Notes also will become convertible prior to maturity if: (i) the assigned credit rating by Moodys or Standard and Poors of the Convertible Notes is at or below Baa2 or BBB, respectively; (ii) the Convertible Notes are called for redemption; or (iii) certain specified corporate transactions have occurred. Separately, we will pay contingent interest to the holders of Convertible Notes during any six month period commencing May 12, 2006 if the average market price of a Convertible Note for a measurement period preceding such six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount. Through September 30, 2005, we have repurchased Convertible Notes with a face value of $5.9 million principal amount at maturity, for their accreted value of $3.5 million, in cash. We may redeem the remaining Convertible Notes for cash on or after May 11, 2006 or, at the option of the holders, we may be required to make additional repurchases on May 11 in each of 2006, 2011, 2016, 55 Table of Contents 2021 and 2026. In this event, we may choose to pay the accreted value of the Convertible Notes in cash or shares of our common stock. The amount that the holders may redeem in the future will depend on, among other factors, the performance of our common stock. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP FAS 109 2). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) was signed into law on October 22, 2004. Under a provision of the Jobs Act, we may elect to repatriate certain earnings of our foreign based subsidiaries at a reduced U.S. federal tax rate in either of our fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 or ending September 30, 2006. FSP FAS 109 2 provides guidance on when an enterprise should recognize in its financial statements the effects of the one time tax benefit of repatriation of foreign earnings under the Jobs Act, and specifies interim disclosure requirements. We are currently evaluating the effect of the repatriation provision under the Jobs Act. We expect to complete this evaluation no earlier than the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. The range of possible amounts we are considering for repatriation is between zero and $1,983 million, and the potential range of federal and state income tax associated with these amounts, which are subject to a reduced tax rate, is between zero and $117.0 million. We continue to look for opportunities to control our costs and expand our global presence. In this regard, we have recently committed approximately $35.5 million to acquire land and build a campus in Hyderabad, India, to establish support services for several of our global functions. At September 30, 2005, we have incurred approximately $3.5 million of these costs. We expect to complete and occupy the campus in fiscal year 2007. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments at September 30, 2005. We believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Non current debt $ 1,208.4 $ 40.2 $ 502.9 $ 80.2 $ 585.1 Operating leases1 345.6 44.8 79.2 55.3 166.3 Purchase obligations2 425.8 128.9 112.0 75.8 109.1 Total Contractual Obligations 1,979.8 213.9 694.1 211.3 860.5 Loan origination commitments 224.1 224.1 Capital contribution commitments3 115.7 115.1 0.6 Total Contractual Obligations and Commitments $ 2,319.6 $ 553.1 $ 694.7 $ 211.3 $ 860.5 1 Operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements totaling $37.6 million as of September 30, 2005. 2 Purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be cancelled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees. In particular, under an agreement to outsource management of our data center and distributed server operations that we can terminate any time after July 1, 2006, we estimate that the termination fee payable in July 2006, not including costs associated with assuming equipment leases, would approximate $13.5 million and would decrease each month for the subsequent two years, reaching a payment of approximately $2.2 million in July 2008. 3 Capital contribution commitments relate to our contractual commitments to fund certain of our sponsored investment products. 56 Table of Contents Contingent Obligations In relation to the auto loan securitization transactions that we have entered into with a number of qualified special purpose entities, we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to note holders up to certain levels as specified in the related agreements. At September 30, 2005, the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these obligations was $31.7 million. In addition, our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2005 included a $0.1 million liability to reflect the fair value of these obligations arising from auto securitization transactions entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002. At September 30, 2005, the banking/finance operating segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling $2.7 million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers, primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers. These standby letters of credit, issued prior to January 1, 2003, were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of $3.0 million at September 30, 2005 and commercial real estate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As discussed above, we obtain financing for sales commissions that we pay to broker/dealers on Class B and certain Class C shares of our sponsored investment products through LFL, a company established in Ireland to provide DCA financing. We hold a 49% ownership interest in LFL and we account for this ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Our exposure to loss related to our investment in LFL is limited to the carrying value of our investment, and interest and fees receivable from LFL. At September 30, 2005, those amounts approximated $21.1 million. During fiscal year 2005, we recognized pre tax income of approximately $9.0 million for our share of its net income over this period. As discussed above, our banking/finance operating segment periodically enters into auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors. Our main objective in entering into these securitization transactions is to obtain financing for auto loan activities. Securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled $577.7 million at September 30, 2005 and $768.9 million at September 30, 2004. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position. For additional information about our accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of intangibles on an ongoing basis. Under SFAS 142, we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles when there is an indication of impairment, or at least once a year. Goodwill impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, calculated based on anticipated discounted cash flows. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. 57 Table of Contents Intangible assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such a test were to indicate that the carrying value of the assets exceeded the undiscounted cash flow expected to result from their use and eventual disposition, an impairment loss would be recognized as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded their fair value. In performing our analysis, we used certain assumptions and estimates including those related to discount rates and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets, based on, among other factors, historical trends and the characteristics of the assets. While we believe that our testing was appropriate, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense. Income Taxes As a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the United States. As of September 30, 2005, and based on tax laws in effect as of this date, it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we have not made a provision for U.S. taxes and have not recorded a deferred tax liability on $2,987.7 million of cumulative undistributed earnings recorded by foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005. Changes to our policy of reinvesting foreign earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Valuation of Investments We record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Where available, we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information. However, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For example, we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold, and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value. We evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the carrying value for an extended period of time. As most of our investments are carried at fair value, if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist, the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income, in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined. We classify securities as trading when it is managements intent at the time of purchase to sell the security within a short period of time. Accordingly, we record unrealized gains and losses on these securities in our consolidated income. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of 58 Table of Contents the claims based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2005 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. See also Note 13 to out Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include in Part II, Item 8 of this report and Legal Proceedings included in Part I, Item 3 of this report. Variable Interest Entities Under FIN 46 R, a variable interest entity (VIE) is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. FIN 46 R requires consolidation of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. Evaluating whether related entities are VIEs, and determining if we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, is highly complex and involves the use of estimates and assumptions. To determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of each VIE, we performed an expected cash flow analysis using certain discount rate and volatility assumptions based on available historical information and managements estimates. Based on our analysis, we consolidated one VIE into our financial statements as of September 30, 2005. While we believe that our testing and approach were appropriate, future changes in estimates and assumptions may affect our decision and lead to the consolidation of other VIEs in our financial statements.

Our investment management and related services business and our banking/finance business are subject to extensive and often complex, overlapping and frequently changing regulation in the United States and abroad, including, among others, securities, banking, accounting and tax laws and regulations. Moreover, financial reporting requirements, and the processes, controls and procedures that have been put in place to address them, are often comprehensive and complex. While management has focused attention and resources on our compliance policies, procedures and practices, non compliance with applicable laws or rules or regulations, either in the United States or abroad, or our inability to keep up with, or adapt to, an often ever changing, complex regulatory environment could result in sanctions against us, including fines and censures, injunctive relief, suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses, any of which could also adversely affect our reputation, prospects, revenues, and earnings. We are subject to federal securities laws, state laws regarding securities fraud, other federal and state laws and rules and regulations of certain regulatory and self regulatory organizations, including those rules and regulations promulgated by, among others, the SEC, the NASD, NYSE and PCX, and to the extent operations or trading in our securities take place outside the United States, by foreign regulations and regulators, such as the U.K. Listing Authority. Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and many of our funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, both of which impose numerous obligations, as well as detailed operational requirements, on our subsidiaries which are investment advisers to registered investment companies. Our subsidiaries, both in the United States and abroad, must comply with a myriad of complex and often changing U.S. and or foreign regulations, some of which may conflict, including complex U.S. and non U.S. tax regimes. Additionally, as we expand our operations, sometimes rapidly, into non U.S. jurisdictions, the rules and regulations of these non U.S. jurisdictions become applicable, sometimes with short compliance deadlines, and add further regulatory complexity to our ongoing compliance operations. In addition, we are a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, or FRB, and are subject to the restrictions, limitations, or prohibitions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. The FRB may impose additional limitations or restrictions on our activities, including if the FRB believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition. Further, our subsidiary, Fiduciary Trust, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC and New York State Banking Department, while another of our subsidiaries is subject to oversight by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The laws and regulations of these regulators generally impose restrictions and requirements in connection with a variety of technical, specialized and recently expanding matters and concerns. For example, compliance with anti money laundering requirements, both domestically and internationally, and the Bank Secrecy Act has taken on heightened importance with regulators as a result of efforts to, among other things, limit terrorism. As we continue to address these requirements or focus on meeting new or expanded ones, we may expend a substantial amount of time and resources, even though our banking/finance business does not constitute our dominant business sector. Moreover, any inability to meet these requirements, within the timeframes set by regulators, may subject us to sanctions or other restrictions by the regulators that impact our broader business. Regulatory and legislative actions and reforms, particularly those specifically focused on the mutual fund industry, are making the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results. During the past five years, the federal securities laws have been augmented substantially and made significantly more complex by, among other measures, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA Patriot Act of 2001. Moreover, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations have directly affected our business. With new laws and changes 61 Table of Contents in interpretation and enforcement of existing requirements, the associated time we must dedicate to, and related costs we must incur in, meeting the regulatory complexities of our business have increased and these outlays have also increased as we expand our business into various non U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in the past few years following the enactment of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, new rules of the SEC, the NYSE, PCX and NASD were promulgated and other rules revised. Among other things, these new laws, rules and regulations have necessitated us to make changes to our corporate governance and public disclosure policies, procedures and practices and our registered investment companies and investment advisers have been required to make similar changes. Compliance activities to meet these new requirements have required us to expend additional time and resources, including without limitation substantial efforts to conduct evaluations required to ensure compliance with the management certification and attestation requirements under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and, consequently, we are incurring increased costs of doing business, which potentially negatively impacts our profitability and future financial results. Moreover, current and pending regulatory and legislative actions and reforms affecting the mutual fund industry, including compliance initiatives, may negatively impact revenues by increasing our costs of accessing or dealing in the financial markets. Any significant limitation or failure of our software applications and other technology systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations. We are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and third party software applications and other technology systems to operate our business. We use our technology to, among other things, obtain securities pricing information, process client transactions and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage. Any inaccuracies, delays or systems failures in these and other processes could subject us to client dissatisfaction and losses. Although we take protective measures, our technology systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other events that have a security impact, such as an authorized employee or vendor inadvertently causing us to release confidential information, which could materially damage our operations or cause the disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information. Moreover, loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation. Most of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from, and supported, upgraded and maintained by, third party vendors. A suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruption. In addition, we have outsourced to a single vendor management of our data center and distributed server operations, and this vendor also is responsible for our disaster recovery systems. A failure by this vendor to continue to manage our data center or support our servers and our disaster recovery systems adequately in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business. Moreover, although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third party failures. Potential system failures or breaches and the cost necessary to correct them could result in material financial loss, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal claims and liability, which in turn could negatively impact our revenues and income. We face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous foreign countries. We sell mutual funds and offer investment management and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally. As we do so, we will continue to face various ongoing challenges to ensure that we have sufficient resources, procedures and controls in place to address and ensure that our operations abroad operate consistently and effectively. Local regulatory environments may vary widely, as may the adequacy and sophistication of each. Similarly, local distributors, and their policies and practices as well as financial viability, may be inconsistent or less developed or mature. Notwithstanding potential long term cost savings by increasing certain operations, such as transfer agent and other back office operations, in countries or regions of the world with lower operating costs, growth of our international operations may involve near term increases in expenses as well as additional capital costs, 62 Table of Contents such as information, systems and technology costs and costs related to compliance with particular regulatory or other local requirements or needs. Local requirements or needs may also place additional demands on sales and compliance personnel and resources, such as meeting local language requirements while also integrating personnel into an organization with a single operating language. Finding and hiring additional, well qualified personnel and crafting and adopting policies, procedures and controls to address local or regional requirements remain a challenge as we expand our operations internationally. Moreover, regulators in non U.S. jurisdictions could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets. Any of these local requirements, activities or needs could increase the costs and expenses we incur in a specific jurisdiction without any corresponding increase in revenues and income from operating in the jurisdiction. We depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services. The success of our business will continue to depend upon our key personnel, including our portfolio and fund managers, investment analysts, investment advisers, sales and management personnel and other professionals as well as our executive officers and business unit heads. In a tightening labor market, competition for qualified, motivated and highly skilled executives, professional and other key personnel in the asset management and banking/finance industries remains significant. Our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals, including through competitive compensation packages, and upon the continued contributions of these people. As our business grows, we are likely to need to increase correspondingly the overall number of individuals that we employ. Moreover, in order to retain certain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals, resulting in additional expense without a corresponding increase in potential revenue. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified individuals, and departure of key investment personnel, in particular, if not replaced, could cause us to lose clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. Moreover, our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of key personnel or our failure to attract replacement or additional qualified personnel could negatively affect our financial performance. Strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and net income. We compete with numerous asset management companies, mutual fund, stock brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions. Our investment products also compete with products offered by these competitors as well as real estate investment trusts, hedge funds and others. Over the past decade, a significant number of new asset management firms and mutual funds have been established, increasing competition. At the same time, consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, product offerings, service quality, distribution relationships, and fees charged. Additionally, competing securities broker/dealers whom we rely upon to distribute and sell our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products, which could limit the distribution of our investment products. To the extent that existing or potential customers, including securities broker/dealers, decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and net income could decline. Our ability to attract and retain assets under our management is also dependent on the relative investment performance of our funds and other managed investment portfolios and our ability to maintain our investment management services fees at competitive levels. Changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth. We derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker/dealers and other similar investment advisers. 63 Table of Contents Increasing competition for these distribution channels and recent regulatory initiatives have caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future or could otherwise negatively impact the distribution of our products. Higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings. Additionally, if one or more of the major financial advisers who distribute our products were to cease operations or limit or otherwise end the distribution of our products, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings. There is no assurance we will continue to have access to the third party broker/dealers and similar investment advisers that currently distribute our products, or continue to have the opportunity to offer all or some of our existing products through them. A failure to maintain strong business relationships with the major investment advisers who currently distribute our products may also impair our distribution and sales operations. Because we use broker/dealers and other similar investment advisers to sell our products, we do not control the ultimate investment recommendations given to clients. Any inability to access and successfully sell our products to clients through third party distribution channels could have a negative effect on our level of assets under management, related revenues and overall business and financial condition. The amount or mix of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations and could negatively impact our revenues and income. We have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets. Individual financial and equity markets may be adversely affected by political, financial or other instabilities that are particular to the country or regions in which a market is located, including without limitation local acts of terrorism, economic crises or other business, social or political crises. Declines in these markets have caused in the past, and would cause in the future, a decline in our revenues and income. Global economic conditions, exacerbated by war or terrorism or financial crises, changes in the equity market place, currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix, market values and levels of our assets under management. Our investment management services revenues are derived primarily from fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and vary with the nature of the account or product managed. A decline in the price of stocks or bonds, or in particular market segments, or in the securities market generally, could cause the value and returns on our assets under management to decline, resulting in a decline in our revenues and income. Moreover, changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix between international and U.S. assets, potentially resulting in a decline in our revenue and income depending upon the nature of our assets under management and the level of investment management fees we earn based on them. Additionally, changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income, as we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage. On the other hand, increases in interest rates, in particular if rapid, or high interest rates, as well as any uncertainty in the future direction of interest rates, may impact negatively on our fixed income products as rising interest rates or interest rate uncertainty typically decrease the total return on many bond investments due to lower market valuations of existing bonds. Any decrease in the level of assets under management resulting from price declines, interest rate volatility or uncertainty or other factors could negatively impact our revenues and income. Our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subject us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with earnings and income generated overseas. While we operate primarily in the United States, we also provide services and earn revenues in Canada, the Bahamas, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia. As a result, we are subject to foreign exchange risk through our foreign operations. While we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk, for example, by denominating a significant amount of our transactions in U.S. dollars, the situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the United States. Stabilization or appreciation of the U.S. dollar could moderate revenues from sales of investment products internationally. Separately, investment management fees that we earn tend to be higher in 64 Table of Contents connection with international assets under management than with U.S. assets under management. Consequently, a downturn in international markets could have a significant effect on our revenues and income. Poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of assets under management, potentially negatively impacting our revenues and income. Our investment performance, along with achieving and maintaining superior distribution and client services, is critical to the success of our investment management and related services business. Strong investment performance often stimulates sales of our investment products. Poor investment performance as compared to third party benchmarks or competitive products could lead to a decrease in sales of investment products we manage and stimulate redemptions from existing products, generally lowering the overall level of assets under management and reducing the investment management fees we earn. We cannot assure you that past or present investment performance in the investment products we manage will be indicative of future performance. Any poor future performance may negatively impact our revenues and income. We could suffer losses in earnings or revenue if our reputation is harmed. Our reputation is important to the success of our business. The Franklin Templeton Investments brand has been, and continues to be, extremely well received both in our industry and with our clients, reflecting the fact that our brand, like our business, is based in part on trust and confidence. If our reputation is harmed, existing clients may reduce amounts held in, or withdraw entirely from, funds that we advise or funds may terminate their investment management agreements with us, which could reduce the amount of assets under management and cause us to suffer a corresponding loss in earnings or revenue. Moreover, reputational harm may cause us to lose current employees and we may be unable to continue to attract new ones with similar qualifications, motivations or skills. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any reputational harm, we may be unsuccessful in repairing any existing harm to our reputation and our future business prospects would likely be affected. Our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which are subject to fluctuation. The level of our expenses are subject to fluctuation and may increase for the following or other reasons: changes in the level and scope of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; changes in expenses and capital costs, including costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; and an increase in insurance expenses including through the assumption of higher deductibles and or co insurance liability. Our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations. Our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business, both domestically and abroad, depends on our ability to integrate the varied accounting, financial, information and operational systems of our various businesses on a global basis. Moreover, adapting or developing our existing technology systems to meet our internal needs, as well as client needs, industry demands and new regulatory requirements, is also critical for our business. The constant introduction of new technologies presents new challenges to us. We have an ongoing need to continually upgrade and improve our various technology systems, including our data processing, financial, accounting and trading systems. This need could present operational issues or require, from time to time, significant capital spending. It also may require us to reevaluate the current value and or expected useful lives of our technology systems, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, our 65 Table of Contents continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. While our operational size, the diversity of locations from which we operate, and our redundant back up systems provide us with a strong advantage should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, we could still experience near term operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular segments of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel in our technology group. Recent disaster recovery efforts, such as in response to Hurricane Wilma on our Fort Lauderdale, Florida operations, have demonstrated that even seemingly localized events may require broader disaster recovery efforts throughout our operations and, consequently, we are constantly assessing and taking steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability. Our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including our asset value, credit worthiness and the market value of our stock. Our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value, our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock. Similarly, our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables, and to obtain continued financing for certain Class C shares, is also subject to the markets perception of those assets, finance rates offered by competitors, and the general market for private debt. If we are unable to obtain these funds and financing, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans. Certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to market specific political, economic or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income. Our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political, economic, and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental polices, expropriation, nationalization, asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership. Foreign trading markets, particularly in some emerging market countries, are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than the U.S. and other established markets. Our revenues, earnings and income could be adversely affected if the terms of our investment management agreements are significantly altered or these agreements are terminated by the funds we advise. Our revenues are dependent on fees earned under investment management and related services agreements that we have with the funds we advise. These revenues could be adversely affected if these agreements are altered significantly or terminated. The decline in revenue that might result from alteration or termination of our investment management services agreements could have a material adverse impact on our earnings or income. Diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans. We compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans, which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales or in some cases zero interest rates. Our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business. Economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans, which could cause losses to our consumer loan portfolio. Future sales of our common stock in the public market, such as upon conversion of our outstanding convertible securities, could adversely affect our stock price. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future 66 Table of Contents sales of shares of our common stock or the availability for future sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. For example, in connection with our May 2001 offering of Convertible Notes, we filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC, which was subsequently declared effective, to register, among other things, approximately 8.2 million shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. Holders may convert their Convertible Notes prior to maturity into 9.3604 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the Convertible Notes, subject to adjustment, following the occurrence of certain specified triggering events, including if, during any calendar quarter, the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than a specified percentage, initially 120% as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2001 and declining 0.084% each quarter thereafter, of the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter. Based on this formula, holders may convert their Convertible Notes during the quarter ending December 31, 2005 because, during the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter was more than $78.34 (118.57% of $66.07, which was the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the quarter). Sale, or the availability for sale, of substantial amounts of common stock by our existing stockholders pursuant to an effective registration statement or under Rule 144, through the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options or the conversion of convertible securities, such as our Convertible Notes, or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Civil litigation arising out of or relating to previously settled governmental investigations or other matters, governmental or regulatory investigations and or examinations and the legal risks associated with our business could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and or our future financial results. We have been named in shareholder class action and other lawsuits, many of which arise out of or relate to previously settled governmental investigations. While management believes that the claims made in these lawsuits are without merit, and while we intend to vigorously defend against them, litigation typically is an expensive process. Risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. Moreover, settlements or judgments against us have the potential of being substantial if we are unsuccessful in settling or otherwise resolving matters early in the process and or on favorable terms. It is also possible that we may be named in additional civil or governmental actions similar to those already instituted. From time to time we may receive requests for documents or other information from governmental authorities or regulatory bodies or we also may become the subject of governmental or regulatory investigations and or examinations. Moreover, governmental or regulatory investigations or examinations that have been inactive could become active. We may be obligated, and under our standard form of indemnification agreement with certain officers and directors in some instances we are obligated, or we may choose, to indemnify directors, officers or employees against liabilities and expenses they may incur in connection with such matters to the extent permitted under applicable law. Eventual exposures from and expenses incurred relating to current and future litigation, investigations, examinations and settlements could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and or our future financial results. Judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in civil litigation against us could affect our reputation, increase our costs of doing business and or negatively impact our revenues, any of which could have a material negative impact on our financial results. 67 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk: the potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange and equity and commodity prices. Financial instruments include, but are not limited to, trade accounts receivable, investment securities, deposits and other debt obligations. Management is responsible for managing market risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks. Our banking/finance operating segment is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its loans receivable, debt securities held, and deposit liabilities. In our banking/finance operating segment, we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources. Our investment management and related services operating segment is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily through its investment in debt securities and its outstanding debt. We minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities, and through diversification. In addition, we seek to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates. At September 30, 2005, we have considered the potential impact of a 2% movement in market interest rates in relation to the banking/finance segment interest earning assets, net of interest bearing liabilities, total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities, individually and in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario. We are subject to foreign exchange risk through our foreign operations. We operate primarily in the United States, but also provide services and earn revenues in Canada, the Bahamas, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimized since a significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the United States. We are exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that are carried at fair value and through investments held by majority owned sponsored investment products that we consolidate. To mitigate this risk, we maintain a diversified investment portfolio. Our exposure to equity price fluctuations is also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions. The following is a summary of the effect that a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices would have on our financial instruments subject to equity price fluctuations at September 30, 2005.
