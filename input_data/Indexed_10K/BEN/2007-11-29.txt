Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Statements In this section, we discuss and analyze the results of operations and financial condition of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, Franklin Templeton Investments). In addition to historical information, we also make statements relating to the future, called forward looking 40 Table of Contents statements, which are provided under the safe harbor protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are generally written in the future tense and or are preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, or other similar words. Moreover, statements that speculate about future events are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. You should carefully review the Risk Factors section set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in any more recent filings with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), each of which describe these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail. While forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. We undertake no obligation, unless required by law, to update any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview We derive the majority of our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management, fund administration, shareholder services, transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services (collectively investment management and related services) to retail mutual funds, and to institutional, high net worth, and separately managed accounts and other investment products. This is our primary business activity and operating segment. The mutual funds and other products that we offer (collectively sponsored investment products) are distributed or marketed to the public globally under six distinct names: Franklin Templeton Mutual Series Bissett Fiduciary Trust Darby We offer a broad range of sponsored investment products under equity, hybrid, fixed income and money market categories that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management. To a lesser degree, our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. Our secondary business and operating segment is banking/finance. Our banking/finance group offers selected private banking services to high net worth clients, and retail banking, consumer lending and trust services. Our consumer lending activities include automobile lending related to the purchase, securitization, and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships, consumer credit and debit cards, real estate equity lines, home equity/mortgage lending and other consumer lending. 41 Table of Contents In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 (fiscal year 2007), our investment management and related services operating segment continued to experience record levels of assets under management. In addition to market appreciation, which reflected, among other things, the positive performance of many equity markets globally, this growth resulted from excess sales over redemptions. In part, we attribute the continued positive trend in excess sales over redemptions to the strong relative performance of our product offerings, the successful marketing to and diversification of our client base, and our focus on customer service. Consistent with the increase in our assets under management, we experienced growth in net income and higher diluted earnings per share in fiscal year 2007, as compared to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 (fiscal year 2006) and September 30, 2005 (fiscal year 2005). We expect to continue focusing on our core strategies of expanding our assets under management and related operations internationally, seeking positive investment performance, protecting and furthering our brand recognition, developing and maintaining broker/dealer and client loyalties, providing a high level of customer service and closely monitoring costs, while also developing our human capital base and our systems and technology. The continued success of these strategies in the future is dependent on various factors, including the relative performance of our sponsored investment products, product innovations by our competitors, and changes in consumer preferences. Results of Operations (dollar amounts in millions except per share data) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 2007vs. 2006 2006vs. 2005 Net Income $ 1,772.9 $ 1,267.6 $ 1,057.6 40 % 20 % Earnings Per Common Share Basic $ 7.11 $ 4.97 $ 4.22 43 % 18 % Diluted 7.03 4.86 4.06 45 % 20 % Operating Margin1 33 % 32 % 30 % 1 Defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues. Net income increased 40% in fiscal year 2007. This was primarily due to increased fees for providing investment management and fund administration services (investment management fees) reflecting a 21% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management, and a 97% increase in other income, net primarily due to an increase in realized gains on sale of investments and higher gains from our consolidated sponsored investment products. These increases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses. Diluted earnings per share increased 45% in fiscal year 2007 consistent with the increase in net income and a decrease in diluted weighted average common stock outstanding. Diluted weighted average common stock outstanding was higher in fiscal year 2006 than in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the repurchases of shares of our common stock and the conversion of Liquid Yield Notes (zero coupon convertible senior notes) into shares of our common stock during fiscal year 2006. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 20% in fiscal year 2006, as compared to fiscal year 2005. These increases were primarily due to increased investment management fees and underwriting and distribution fees, each consistent with a 17% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management and higher gross sales on which commissions are earned. These increases were partially offset 42 Table of Contents by higher underwriting and distribution, and compensation and benefits expenses, as well as higher taxes on income, reflecting an income tax charge of $105.5 million recorded in fiscal year 2006 related to repatriated earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries under the Jobs Act. Assets Under Management (dollar amounts in billions) as of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 2007vs. 2006 2006vs. 2005 Equity Global/international $ 286.7 $ 217.6 $ 185.7 32 % 17 % Domestic (U.S.) 100.5 84.4 77.9 19 % 8 % Total equity 387.2 302.0 263.6 28 % 15 % Hybrid 117.2 90.6 78.4 29 % 16 % Fixed Income Tax free 59.0 55.6 53.8 6 % 3 % Taxable Global/international 43.0 24.4 18.7 76 % 30 % Domestic (U.S.) 31.8 32.4 32.7 (2 )% (1 )% Total fixed income 133.8 112.4 105.2 19 % 7 % Money Market 7.7 6.3 5.9 22 % 7 % Total $ 645.9 $ 511.3 $ 453.1 26 % 13 % Simple Monthly Average for the Year2 $ 582.0 $ 482.4 $ 410.8 21 % 17 % 2 Investment management fees from approximately 57% of our assets under management at September 30, 2007 were calculated using daily average assets under management. Our assets under management at September 30, 2007 were $645.9 billion, 26% higher than they were at the same time last year primarily due to market appreciation of $95.2 billion and excess sales over redemptions of $46.6 billion during fiscal year 2007. Simple monthly average assets under management, which are generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management and fund administration services (investment management services) than the year over year change in ending assets under management, increased by 21% during fiscal year 2007, as compared to fiscal year 2006. The simple monthly average mix of assets under management is shown below. for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 Equity 60 % 59 % 57 % Hybrid 18 % 17 % 17 % Fixed income 21 % 23 % 25 % Money market 1 % 1 % 1 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 43 Table of Contents The following table presents industry asset weighted average management fee rates3. Our actual effective investment management fee rates may vary from these rates. for the fiscal years ended September 30, Industry Average2007 Industry Average2006 Industry Average2005 Equity Global/international 0.63 % 0.67 % 0.72 % Domestic (U.S.) 0.47 % 0.50 % 0.54 % Hybrid 0.38 % 0.38 % 0.44 % Fixed Income Tax free 0.38 % 0.40 % 0.41 % Taxable Global/international 0.55 % 0.56 % 0.57 % Domestic (U.S.) 0.37 % 0.39 % 0.43 % Money Market 0.22 % 0.24 % 0.25 % 3 Industry asset weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from Lipper&reg; Inc. at September 30, 2007 and include all U.S. based, open ended funds that reported expense data to Lipper&reg; Inc. as of the funds most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. As defined by Lipper&reg; Inc., management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity products are not included. Our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management) was 0.614% for fiscal years 2007 and 2006. The effective investment management fee rate remained unchanged primarily due to the favorable change in the mix of assets under management, resulting from higher excess sales over redemptions and greater appreciation of equity and hybrid products as compared to fixed income products, which was offset by a decrease in performance fees resulting from the divestiture of assets under management of a former subsidiary at October 1, 2006. Generally, investment management fees earned on equity and hybrid products are higher than fees earned on fixed income products. For fiscal year 2006, our effective investment management fee rate increased to 0.614% from 0.598% in fiscal year 2005. Higher excess sales over redemptions and greater appreciation for equity and hybrid products as compared to fixed income products, and an increase in performance fees, led to this increase in the effective investment management fee rate. Assets under management by sales region were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) as of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 % of Total 2006 % of Total 2005 % of Total United States $ 460.8 71 % $ 381.9 75 % $ 343.5 76 % Europe 82.5 13 % 55.1 11 % 46.4 10 % Asia Pacific 53.0 8 % 35.0 7 % 26.4 6 % Canada 47.9 8 % 37.8 7 % 33.9 7 % Other 1.7 0 % 1.5 0 % 2.9 1 % Total $ 645.9 100 % $ 511.3 100 % $ 453.1 100 % As shown in the table, approximately 71% of our assets under management at September 30, 2007 originated from our U.S. sales region. In addition, approximately 65% of our operating revenues originated from our U.S. operations in fiscal year 2007. Due to the global nature of our business operations, investment management and related services may be performed in locations unrelated to the sales region. 44 Table of Contents Components of the change in our assets under management were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs.2006 2006 vs.2005 Beginning assets under management $ 511.3 $ 453.1 $ 361.9 13 % 25 % Sales 185.6 128.8 122.5 44 % 5 % Reinvested distributions 20.7 13.9 8.3 49 % 67 % Redemptions (139.0 ) (116.6 ) (86.5 ) 19 % 35 % Distributions (25.9 ) (17.3 ) (10.8 ) 50 % 60 % (Dispositions) acquisitions (2.0 ) 0.2 0.1 N/A 100 % Appreciation 95.2 49.2 57.6 93 % (15 )% Ending Assets Under Management $ 645.9 $ 511.3 $ 453.1 26 % 13 % Excess sales over redemptions were $46.6 billion in fiscal year 2007 as compared to $12.2 billion in fiscal year 2006 and $36.0 billion in fiscal year 2005. Our products experienced $95.2 billion in appreciation in fiscal year 2007 primarily related to our equity products, as compared to $49.2 billion in fiscal year 2006 and $57.6 billion in fiscal year 2005. Dispositions in fiscal year 2007 included the divestiture of assets under management of a former subsidiary at October 1, 2006. On April 3, 2006, we acquired a further 0.2% ownership interest in Bradesco Templeton Asset Management Ltda., (BTAM), a Brazilian joint venture, in addition to the 49.9% ownership interest that we already held, resulting in the addition of BTAMs total assets under management as of the acquisition date of $0.2 billion. In July 2006, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests in BTAM, and changed its name to Franklin Templeton Investimentos (Brasil) Ltda. On January 1, 2005, we acquired the general partner of the Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Emerging Europe Fund, L.P., a private equity fund focused on Central and Eastern Europe, which added $0.1 billion in assets under management as of the acquisition date. Operating Revenues The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category and the percentage of total operating revenues represented by each revenue category. Percentage Change Percentage of TotalOperating Revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 2007 2006 2005 Investment management fees 21 % 21 % 58 % 59 % 57 % Underwriting and distribution fees 30 % 15 % 37 % 35 % 36 % Shareholder servicing fees 7 % 2 % 4 % 5 % 6 % Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net 1 % 75 % Other, net 9 % 2 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Total Operating Revenues 23 % 17 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Investment Management Fees Investment management fees accounted for 58% of our operating revenues in fiscal year 2007, as compared to 59% in fiscal year 2006 and 57% in fiscal year 2005. Investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. 45 Table of Contents Investment management fees increased 21% in fiscal year 2007 consistent with a 21% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a relatively unchanged effective investment management fee rate. Investment management fees increased 21% in fiscal year 2006 consistent with a 17% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in simple monthly average mix of assets under management from fixed income products towards equity products, which generally carry higher investment management fees than fixed income products, and an increase in performance fees. Underwriting and Distribution Fees We earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase. Sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor. Therefore, underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors. Globally, our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. Specifically, the majority of U.S. registered mutual funds, with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds, have adopted distribution plans (the Plans) under Rule 12b 1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (Rule 12b 1). The Plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares, such as expenses for marketing, advertising, printing and sales promotion, subject to the Plans limitations on amounts. The individual Plans set a percentage limit for Rule 12b 1 expenses based on average daily net assets under management of the mutual fund. Similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non U.S. funds and where, generally, the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions. We pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf. See the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below. Overall, underwriting and distribution fees increased 30% in fiscal year 2007. Underwriting fees increased 36% primarily due to a 44% increase in gross product sales, including product sales that do not generate underwriting and distribution revenues. Distribution fees increased 26% consistent with a 21% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in equity products as compared to fixed income products in the simple monthly average mix of assets under management. Distribution fees are generally higher for equity products, as compared to fixed income products. Underwriting and distribution fees increased 15% in fiscal year 2006. Underwriting fees increased 5% consistent with a 5% increase in gross product sales. Distribution fees increased 21% consistent with a 17% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset and share class mix. Shareholder Servicing Fees Shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some instances, sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management. We receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements, transaction processing, 46 Table of Contents customer service, and tax reporting. In the United States, transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Approximately 300 thousand accounts closed in Canada during calendar year 2006 and were no longer billable effective May 1, 2007, as compared to approximately 358 thousand accounts closed during calendar year 2005 that were no longer billable effective May 1, 2006. Approximately 1.5 million accounts closed in the U.S. during calendar year 2006 and were no longer billable effective July 1, 2007, as compared to approximately 1.6 million accounts closed during calendar year 2005 that were no longer billable effective July 1, 2006. Shareholder servicing fees increased 7% in fiscal year 2007 and 2% in fiscal year 2006. The increases reflect a 14% increase and a 7% increase, respectively, in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts, partially offset by a shift to shareholder accounts that are billable at a lower rate, including shareholder accounts originated in Asia. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products Income, Net Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net reflects the net investment income, including dividends received, of sponsored investment products consolidated under Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net increased 1% in fiscal year 2007 and 75% in fiscal year 2006. The fluctuation in the consolidated sponsored investment products income, net, reflects the investment performance and the net assets size of the specific sponsored investment products that we consolidate. Other, Net Other, net primarily consists of revenues from the banking/finance operating segment as well as income from custody services. Revenues from the banking/finance operating segment include interest income on loans, servicing income, and investment income on banking/finance investment securities, and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for loan losses. Other, net increased 9% in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to higher securitization gains relating to securitizations of automobile loans in October 2006 and April 2007, interest income on debt securities, and servicing fees from automobile loans, partially offset by a decrease in interest income related to our consumer lending business. Other, net increased 2% in fiscal year 2006 due to higher interest income on automobile loans and investments, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to deposits and our financing of the automobile lending program, as well as an increase in the provision for loan losses primarily related to our automobile portfolio. 47 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The table below presents the percentage change in each expense category and the percentage of total operating expenses represented by each expense category. Percentage Change Percentage of TotalOperating Expenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 2007 2006 2005 Underwriting and distribution 32 % 17 % 52 % 48 % 47 % Compensation and benefits 15 % 8 % 26 % 27 % 29 % Information systems, technology and occupancy 5 % 5 % 8 % 9 % 9 % Advertising and promotion 21 % 14 % 5 % 5 % 4 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 22 % 6 % 4 % 4 % 4 % Impairment of intangible assets (100 )% N/A 2 % Provision for governmental investigations, proceedings and actions, net (100 )% 1 % Other 27 % 11 % 5 % 5 % 6 % Total Operating Expenses 21 % 13 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Underwriting and Distribution Underwriting and distribution expenses include expenses payable to financial advisers and other third parties for providing sales, marketing and distribution services to investors in our sponsored investment products. Underwriting and distribution expenses increased 32% in fiscal year 2007 and 17% in fiscal year 2006 consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues. Underwriting and distribution expenses for fiscal year 2007 included a one time distribution charge of $12.7 million related to the termination of certain limited partnerships in Canada. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefit expenses increased 15% in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to an increase in bonus expense, including bonus expense under the Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the AIP), pursuant to which bonus awards have been made, based, in part, on our performance. The increase also reflected our annual merit salary adjustments that were effective December 1, 2006 and higher staffing levels. In fiscal year 2007, we recorded additional charges to compensation and benefits for the repurchase of stock based compensation awards that previously had been recognized as a charge to capital in excess of par value, and for certain employee costs incurred in a business combination that previously had been recognized as goodwill, partially offset by a reduction to compensation and benefit expenses for a previously unrecognized receivable for the estimated refundable portion of workers compensation premiums. The impact of these adjustments resulted in an additional non cash charge of $16.4 million pre tax to compensation and benefits in fiscal year 2007. We continued to experience a decrease in stock option expense in fiscal year 2007, as compared to prior fiscal year as no new awards have been granted since November 2004. Compensation and benefit expenses increased 8% in fiscal year 2006 primarily as a result of our annual merit salary adjustments that were effective December 1, 2005 and higher staffing levels. Compensation and benefit expenses for fiscal year 2006 also included additional expenses related to stock options and the 1998 Employee Stock Investment Plan resulting from our adoption of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), as well as an increase in other 48 Table of Contents employee benefits. These increases were partially offset by a decline in expense related to certain performance based bonus plans outside of our Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan. We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue. We employed approximately 8,700 people at September 30, 2007 as compared to approximately 8,000 at September 30, 2006. Information Systems, Technology and Occupancy Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased 5% in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to an increase in external data services costs, technology supplies and software, and higher occupancy costs related to our existing offices worldwide as well as global expansion. Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased 5% in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to higher occupancy costs related to global expansion and an increase in external data services costs, software and technology consulting. These increases were partially offset by a continued decrease in depreciation levels associated with a decline in the number and scope of technology projects that were completed and that were therefore subject to amortization. Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs, which exclude occupancy costs, are shown below. (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 Net carrying amount at beginning of period $ 44.9 $ 42.7 $ 51.3 Additions during period, net of disposals and other adjustments 42.0 26.1 21.3 Amortization during period (25.3 ) (23.9 ) (29.9 ) Net Carrying Amount at End of Period $ 61.6 $ 44.9 $ 42.7 Advertising and Promotion Advertising and promotion expenses increased 21% in fiscal year 2007 and 14% in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to an increase in marketing support payments made to intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf in the United States. We are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and in order to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities, which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues. In addition to potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, advertising and promotion may also be impacted by changes in levels of sales and assets under management that affect marketing support payments made to the distributors of our sponsored investment products. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Certain fund share classes sold globally, including Class C and Class R shares marketed in the United States, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders, although our distribution subsidiaries pay a 49 Table of Contents commission on the sale. In addition, certain share classes, such as Class A shares sold in the United States, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met although our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on these sales. We defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over 12 months to 8 years depending on share class or financing arrangements. The U.S. funds that had offered Class B shares and carried a deferred sales charge arrangement ceased offering these shares to new investors and existing shareholders effective during the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Existing Class B shareholders may continue to exchange shares into Class B shares of different funds and they may also continue to reinvest dividends on Class B shares in additional Class B shares. Historically, Class B and certain of our Class C deferred commission assets (DCA) arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations have been financed through transfers to or other arrangements with Lightning Finance Company Limited (LFL), a company registered in Ireland in which we hold a 49% ownership interest. In December 2005, LFL transferred substantially all of its DCA to Lightning Asset Finance Limited (LAFL), an Irish special purpose vehicle formed in December 2005, in which we also hold a 49% ownership interest. LAFL was formed for the sole purpose of acquiring and holding substantially all of the DCA owned by LFL as of December 29, 2005. The holder of the 51% ownership interests in both LFL and LAFL is a subsidiary of an international banking institution which is not affiliated with the Company. As of December 2005, our DCA have been financed generally by an independent third party. Under the U.S arrangements, the funds contract with our U.S. distributor, which in turn contracted with LFL. As a result, we maintain a significant interest in both LFL and LAFL and continue to carry the DCA on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until these assets are amortized or sold by LAFL. Neither we nor our distribution subsidiaries retain any direct ownership interest in the DCA, and, therefore, the DCA are not available to satisfy claims of our creditors or those of our distribution subsidiaries. In contrast to the U.S. arrangements, the arrangements outside the United States are, in most cases, direct agreements with our Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and, as a result, we do not record DCA from these sources in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased 22% in fiscal year 2007 and 6% in fiscal year 2006. The increases were consistent with increases in product sales that carry deferred commission charges primarily related to the U.S. and Canadian funds. Impairment of Intangible Assets During the quarter ended December 31, 2006, we completed our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under the guidance set out in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of October 1, 2006. No impairment loss in the fair value of intangible assets subject to amortization was recognized during fiscal year 2007. During the quarter ended March 31, 2006, Fiduciary Trust implemented a plan of reorganization designed to emphasize its distinct high net worth brand and to pursue further integration opportunities within Franklin Templeton Investments for its institutional business line. These changes to Fiduciary Trusts business required us to review the carrying value of acquired customer base intangible assets of Fiduciary Trust. As a result of these changes, we recorded a $68.4 million non cash impairment charge to customer base definite lived intangible assets of Fiduciary Trust in the quarter ended March 31, 2006. 50 Table of Contents Provision for Governmental Investigations, Proceedings and Actions, Net In fiscal year 2005, we recognized charges to income aggregating to $42.0 million ($26.5 million, net of taxes) and we received $8.4 million from our insurance provider for certain legal costs we incurred associated with previously disclosed governmental investigations, proceedings and actions. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses primarily consist of professional fees, fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, corporate travel and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other operating expenses increased 27% in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to higher litigation costs, an increase in fund administration services fees payable to external parties and an increase in consulting and professional fees, including additional costs related to the distribution of market timing settlements. Other operating expenses increased 11% in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to an increase in fund administration services fees payable to external parties, an increase in corporate travel and entertainment, higher costs associated with the resolution of nominal transaction or operational claims, and higher consulting and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees, partially due to a decline in costs incurred and reimbursements from our insurance carrier related to governmental investigations, proceedings and actions. Other Income (Expenses) Other income (expenses) includes net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) on consolidated sponsored investment products, investment and other income, net and interest expense. Investment and other income, net is comprised primarily of income related to our investments, including dividends, interest income, realized gains and losses and income from investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, as well as minority interest in less than wholly owned subsidiaries and sponsored investments products that we consolidate and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expenses) increased 97% in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to an increase in realized gains on sale of investments, higher gains on our consolidated sponsored investment products and an increase in income from investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Other income (expenses) increased 53% in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to an increase in interest income, dividends and realized gains from our investments, as well as a decline in interest expense on our debt. These increases were partially offset by an increase in minority interest in less than wholly owned subsidiaries, net realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses from our non U.S. operations, and an other than temporary decline in value in certain of our long term investments. Taxes on Income As a multi national corporation, we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international sponsored investment products, often managed from locations outside the United States. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the United States. The mix of pre tax income (primarily from our investment management and related services business) subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the United States, produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing U.S. federal and state income tax rates. 51 Table of Contents Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2007 decreased to 28.08%, as compared to 30.94% in fiscal year 2006 and 25.56% in fiscal year 2005. The decrease in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to absence of an income tax charge of $105.5 million related to repatriated earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries under the Jobs Act recorded in fiscal year 2006, partially offset by increases in income tax liabilities in certain U.S. state and local tax jurisdictions. Income taxes were provided at a reduced rate for fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a favorable U.S. state tax ruling, obtained in fiscal year 2005, which resulted in a refund of tax from multiple prior years. The effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non U.S. earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity, and sources and uses of capital: (in millions) as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 Balance Sheet Data Assets Liquid assets $ 5,814.6 $ 5,347.8 $ 4,814.4 Cash and cash equivalents 3,584.2 3,613.1 3,152.2 Liabilities Commercial paper $ $ 168.1 $ 169.4 Medium term notes 420.0 420.0 420.0 Variable funding notes 240.8 232.3 239.2 Convertible notes 540.1 Other long term debt 162.1 207.9 248.3 Total debt $ 822.9 $ 1,028.3 $ 1,617.0 Cash Flow Data Operating cash flows $ 1,673.6 $ 1,277.9 $ 850.0 Investing cash flows (306.2 ) 36.5 (257.6 ) Financing cash flows (1,449.2 ) (853.4 ) (357.5 ) Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables, and current investments (trading, available for sale and other). Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash, including money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2007 decreased from September 30, 2006 primarily due to net cash usage in financing and investing activities, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows. At September 30, 2007, the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by our U.S. and non U.S. operations were approximately 57% and 43% as compared to approximately 79% and 21% at September 30, 2006. The decrease in total debt outstanding from September 30, 2006 primarily relates to the repayment of commercial paper with a face value of $170.0 million at maturity in fiscal year 2007 and the decline in the other long term liability recognized in relation to the U.S. DCA originally financed by LFL. We experienced higher operating cash flows in fiscal year 2007, as compared to fiscal year 2006, primarily due to higher net income and higher proceeds from the securitization of loans held for sale, partially offset by higher origination of loans held for sale. In fiscal year 2007, we experienced net cash outflows in investing activities, as compared to net cash inflows in fiscal year 2006, primarily due to acquisition transactions relating to certain Indian subsidiaries as well as an excess purchase of investments 52 Table of Contents over liquidations. Net cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2007, as compared to fiscal year 2006, primarily due to an increase in common stock repurchases, an increase in repayments of debt, net of origination, and a decrease in bank deposits. Capital Resources We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and the ability to issue debt or equity securities. In particular, we expect to finance future investment in our banking/finance activities through operating cash flows, debt, increased deposit base, and the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities. At September 30, 2007, we had $420.0 million available under a Five Year Facility Credit Agreement with certain banks and financial institutions expiring in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010 and $500.0 million of commercial paper also available for issuance. In addition, at September 30, 2007, our banking/finance operating segment had $350.0 million in available uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the Federal Reserve Funds system and an aggregate of $135.0 million in available secured line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and Federal Home Loan Bank short term borrowing capacity. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. In extreme circumstances, we might not be able to access this liquidity readily. Our banking/finance operating segment finances its automobile lending business primarily by issuing variable funding notes (the variable funding notes) under a one year revolving $250.0 million variable funding note warehouse credit facility and with inter segment loans. This facility was originally entered into in March 2005, and subsequently extended for additional one year terms in March 2006 and March 2007. The variable funding notes issued under this facility are payable to certain administered conduits and are secured by cash and a pool of automobile loans that meet or are expected to meet certain eligibility requirements. Credit enhancements for the variable funding notes require us to provide, as collateral, loans held for sale with a fair value in excess of the principal amount of the variable funding notes, as well as to hold in trust additional cash balances to cover certain shortfalls. In addition, we provide a payment provider commitment in an amount not to exceed 4.66% of the pool balance. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements, accounted for as freestanding derivatives, intended to mitigate the interest rate risk between the fixed interest rate on the pool of automobile loans and the floating interest rate being paid on the variable funding notes. We currently expect to renew or replace the variable funding warehouse credit facility upon its expiration. Our ability to access the securitization and capital markets will directly affect our plans to finance the automobile loan portfolio in the future. In April 2007, we sold Templeton Funds Annuity Company, a wholly owned subsidiary and a life insurance company, for approximately $14.5 million in cash and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $3.0 million. Approximately $11.5 million of the cash proceeds was recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in fiscal year 2007. Uses of Capital We expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business, make strategic acquisitions, acquire shares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the 53 Table of Contents business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt. We continue to look for opportunities to control our costs and expand our global presence. In this regard, in fiscal year 2005 we entered into a commitment to acquire land and build a campus in Hyderabad, India, to establish support services for several of our global functions. Our estimated total cost to complete the campus at September 30, 2007 was $75.0 million, of which $57.7 million had been incurred as of this date. We inaugurated the opening of the campus in January 2007 and expect to complete the construction of an additional building in fiscal year 2008. In April 2007, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in our joint ventures in India, Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Private Limited and Franklin Templeton Trustee Services Private Limited, from an unrelated third party for approximately $89.7 million. During fiscal year 2007, we paid regular cash dividends of $142.7 million. During fiscal year 2007, we repaid commercial paper with a face value of $170.0 million at maturity. The five year senior notes due April 15, 2008 totaling $420.0 million (medium term notes) were reclassified from long term debt to current maturities of long term debt as the contractual maturity of the notes is less than one year from the balance sheet date. We currently expect to repay the medium term notes at the scheduled maturity date. We maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program is affected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. During fiscal year 2007, we repurchased 10.1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1,288.7 million. The common stock repurchases made as of September 30, 2007 reduced our capital in excess of par value to nil and the excess amount was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings. At September 30, 2007, approximately 9.3 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase program is not subject to an expiration date. From October 1, 2007 through November 27, 2007, the Company repurchased 5,409,674 shares of its common stock for a total cost of $662.5 million. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments. We believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities. (in millions) as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Non current debt $ 162.1 $ 42.6 $ 81.2 $ 37.4 $ 0.9 Operating leases4 371.7 47.0 86.0 79.5 159.2 Purchase obligations5 346.6 129.5 101.1 65.4 50.6 Total Contractual Obligations 880.4 219.1 268.3 182.3 210.7 Loan origination commitments 232.9 193.9 0.5 14.2 24.3 Capital contribution commitments6 64.5 31.5 14.7 13.9 4.4 Total Contractual Obligations and Commitments $ 1,177.8 $ 444.5 $ 283.5 $ 210.4 $ 239.4 4 Operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements totaling $18.0 million as of September 30, 2007. 5 Purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be cancelled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees. In particular, under an agreement to outsource the operations of our data centers (including responsibility for processing data and managing the centers), which we can terminate at any time, we estimated that the termination fee payable in October 2007, not including costs associated with assuming equipment leases, would approximate $4.8 million and would decrease each month thereafter, reaching a minimum termination charge of approximately $2.2 million in July 2008. 6 Capital contribution commitments relate to our contractual commitments to fund certain of our sponsored investment products. Contingent Obligations In relation to the automobile loan securitization transactions that we have entered into with a number of qualified special purpose entities, we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to note holders up to certain levels as specified in the related agreements. At September 30, 2007, the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these obligations was $43.3 million and the fair value of obligations arising from automobile securitization transactions entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2007 were not significant. At September 30, 2007, the banking/finance operating segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling $2.6 million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers, primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers. These standby letters of credit were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of $2.8 million at September 30, 2007. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As discussed above, we hold a 49% ownership interest in LFL and LAFL and we account for the ownership interest in these companies using the equity method of accounting. As of September 30, 2007, LFL had approximately $11.0 million in total assets and our exposure to loss related to LFL was limited to the carrying value of our investment, and interest and fees receivable totaling approximately $1.1 million. 55 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2007, LAFL had approximately $331.6 million in total assets and our maximum exposure to loss related to LAFL totaled approximately $163.7 million. We recognized pre tax income of approximately $3.7 million and $7.4 million for our share of LFLs and LAFLs net income in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Due to our significant interest in LAFL, we continue to carry on our balance sheet the DCA generated in the United States until these assets are amortized or sold by LAFL. Neither we nor our distribution subsidiaries retain any direct ownership interest in the DCA, and, therefore, the DCA are not available to satisfy claims of our creditors or those of our distribution subsidiaries. As discussed above, our banking/finance operating segment periodically enters into automobile loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors (see Note 9 Securitization of Loans Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K). Our main objective in entering into these securitization transactions is to obtain financing for automobile loan activities. Securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled $749.8 million at September 30, 2007 and $514.8 million at September 30, 2006. The Company, in its role as agent or trustee, facilitates the settlement of investor share purchase, redemption, and other transactions with affiliated mutual funds. The Company is appointed by the affiliated mutual funds as agent or trustee to manage, on behalf of the affiliated mutual funds, bank deposit accounts that contain only (i) cash remitted by investors to the affiliated mutual funds for the direct purchase of fund shares, or (ii) cash remitted by the affiliated mutual funds for direct delivery to the investors for either the proceeds of fund shares liquidated at the investors direction, or dividends and capital gains earned on fund shares. As of September 30, 2007 and 2006, we held cash of approximately $170.2 million and $160.5 million off balance sheet in agency or trust for investors and the affiliated mutual funds. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position. For additional information about our accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. SFAS 142 also requires indefinite lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. We perform annual impairment tests in the first quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing a two step process. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units, and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is 56 Table of Contents not performed. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow projections and models similar to those employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Indefinite lived intangible asset impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. In estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow projections to be derived from these assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), we test definite lived intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In estimating the fair value of intangible assets subject to amortization, we use valuation techniques based on undiscounted cash flow projections, without interest charges, to be derived from these assets. In performing our impairment analyses, we use certain assumptions and estimates, including those related to discount rates and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets, based on, among other factors, historical trends and the characteristics of the assets. While we believe that our testing was appropriate, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements, using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the United States and generate earnings from our non U.S. subsidiaries. At September 30, 2007, and based on tax laws then in effect, it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, except for previously taxed foreign subsidiary Subpart F income and the earnings of material consolidated non U.S. subsidiaries taxed at higher local jurisdiction rates than the U.S. income tax rate. As a result, we have not made a provision for U.S. taxes and have not recorded a deferred tax liability on $2.6 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings recorded by non U.S. subsidiaries at September 30, 2007. Changes to our policy of reinvesting non U.S. earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Valuation of Investments We record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Where available, we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do 57 Table of Contents not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information. However, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For example, we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold, and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value. We evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the carrying value for an extended period of time. As most of our investments are carried at fair value, if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist in available for sale securities, the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined. We classify securities as trading when it is managements intent at the time of purchase to sell the security within a short period of time. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized as gains and losses currently in earnings. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2007 to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. See also Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Under FIN 46R, a variable interest entity (VIE) is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. FIN 46R requires consolidation of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. We evaluate whether related entities are VIEs and determine if we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. These evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions. To determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of VIEs, we utilize expected cash flow scenarios that include discount rate and volatility assumptions that are based on available historical information and managements estimates. Based on our analysis, we determined that we have no VIEs to consolidate in our financial statements as of September 30, 2007. While we believe that our testing and approach are appropriate, future changes in estimates and assumptions may affect whether certain related entities are consolidated in our financial statements under FIN 46R. 58 Table of Contents Banking/Finance Segment Interest Income and Margin Analysis The following table presents the banking/finance operating segments net interest income and margin: (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 as of and for the fiscal years endedSeptember 30, AverageBalance Interest AverageRate AverageBalance Interest AverageRate AverageBalance Interest AverageRate Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell $ 230.2 $ 12.3 5.34 % $ 169.8 $ 5.7 3.36 % $ 80.9 $ 2.4 2.97 % Investment securities, available for sale 146.6 9.4 6.41 % 202.3 12.5 6.18 % 238.5 8.5 3.56 % Loans to banking clients7 455.5 37.3 8.19 % 485.9 42.6 8.77 % 441.4 30.9 7.00 % Total earning assets $ 832.3 $ 59.0 7.09 % $ 858.0 $ 60.8 7.09 % $ 760.8 $ 41.8 5.49 % Interest bearing deposits $ 371.5 $ 14.2 3.82 % $ 426.3 $ 14.5 3.40 % $ 555.4 $ 7.5 1.35 % Inter segment debt 3.5 0.2 5.71 % 19.8 0.8 4.04 % 18.6 0.4 2.15 % Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 2.7 0.1 3.70 % 2.5 0.1 4.00 % 2.6 0.1 3.85 % Variable funding notes 149.6 9.6 6.42 % 159.2 9.8 6.16 % 77.9 2.9 3.72 % Total interest bearing liabilities $ 527.3 $ 24.1 4.57 % $ 607.8 $ 25.2 4.15 % $ 654.5 $ 10.9 1.67 % Net interest income and margin $ 34.9 4.19 % $ 35.6 4.15 % $ 30.9 4.06 % 7 Non accrual loans are included in the average loans receivable balance. 59 Table of Contents Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) (in thousands except per share data) Quarter First Second Third Fourth Fiscal year 2007 Operating revenues $ 1,427,815 $ 1,509,006 $ 1,639,811 $ 1,629,137 Operating income 508,070 499,083 519,006 541,388 Net income 426,800 440,866 468,364 436,908 Earnings per share Basic $ 1.69 $ 1.75 $ 1.89 $ 1.78 Diluted $ 1.67 $ 1.73 $ 1.86 $ 1.76 Dividend per share $ 0.15 $ 0.15 $ 0.15 $ 0.15 Common stock price per share High $ 114.98 $ 126.71 $ 139.32 $ 145.59 Low $ 103.50 $ 111.31 $ 118.80 $ 113.08 Fiscal year 2006 Operating revenues $ 1,181,452 $ 1,254,770 $ 1,317,275 $ 1,297,229 Operating income 404,586 349,757 451,986 427,052 Net income 317,969 196,516 371,414 381,669 Earnings per share Basic $ 1.26 $ 0.76 $ 1.44 $ 1.51 Diluted $ 1.21 $ 0.74 $ 1.41 $ 1.49 Dividend per share $ 0.12 $ 0.12 $ 0.12 $ 0.12 Common stock price per share High $ 98.86 $ 104.25 $ 98.35 $ 106.69 Low $ 77.63 $ 92.84 $ 80.16 $ 82.37 Fiscal year 2005 Operating revenues $ 986,022 $ 1,051,181 $ 1,109,734 $ 1,163,161 Operating income 300,084 273,281 346,479 368,532 Net income 239,989 221,274 261,873 334,495 Earnings per share Basic $ 0.96 $ 0.88 $ 1.04 $ 1.33 Diluted $ 0.92 $ 0.85 $ 1.01 $ 1.28 Dividend per share $ 0.10 $ 2.10 $ 0.10 $ 0.10 Common stock price per share High $ 71.45 $ 73.54 $ 77.64 $ 84.72 Low $ 55.66 $ 64.65 $ 63.56 $ 76.93 Risk Factors For a description of certain risk factors and other important factors that may affect us, our subsidiaries and our business, please see the description of the risk factors set forth under Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk: the potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange and equity prices. Financial instruments include, but are not limited to, trade accounts receivable, investment securities, deposits and other debt obligations. Management is responsible for managing market risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks. 60 Table of Contents Our banking/finance operating segment is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its loans receivable, debt securities held, and deposit liabilities. In our banking/finance operating segment, we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources and, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure (see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K). Our investment management and related services operating segment is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily through its investment in debt securities and its outstanding debt. We minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities, and through diversification. In addition, we seek to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates. At September 30, 2007, we have considered the potential impact of a 2% movement in market interest rates in relation to the banking/finance segment interest earning assets, net of interest bearing liabilities, total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities, individually and in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations. We operate primarily in the United States, but also provide services and earn revenues in The Bahamas, Asia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Africa and Australia. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized since a significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the United States. We are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value and investments held by majority owned sponsored investment products that we consolidate, which are also carried at fair value. To mitigate this risk, we maintain a diversified investment portfolio and, from time to time, we may enter into derivative agreements (see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K).
