Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Statements In this section, we discuss and analyze the results of operations and financial condition of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, Franklin Templeton Investments). In addition to historical information, we also make statements relating to the future, called forward looking statements, which are provided under the safe harbor protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are generally written in the future tense and or are preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, or other similar words. Moreover, statements that speculate about future events are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. You should carefully review the Risk Factors section set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in any more recent filings with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), each of which describe these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail. While forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. If a circumstance occurs after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate, we do not have an obligation, and we undertake no obligation, to announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revisions to our forward looking statements, unless required by law. 37 Table of Contents Overview We are a global investment management company and derive the majority of our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to our retail mutual funds, and to institutional, high net worth, and separately managed accounts and other investment products. Our services include fund administration, shareholder services, transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services Our sponsored investment products and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to the public globally under six distinct brand names: Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series, Bissett, Fiduciary Trust and Darby. We offer a broad range of sponsored investment products under equity, hybrid, fixed income and money market categories that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management. As noted in the Risk Factors section set forth above in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the amount and mix of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations and could negatively impact our revenues and income. To a lesser degree, our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. Our secondary business is banking/finance. Our banking/finance group offers retail banking and consumer lending services and private banking services to high net worth clients. Our consumer lending and retail banking activities include automobile lending related to the purchase, securitization, and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships, consumer credit and debit cards, real estate equity lines and home equity/mortgage lending. During fiscal year 2008, we operated in a period of sustained volatility in global financial markets, which resulted from the continuing credit crisis in the United States. During 2008, major banks and other financial institutions reported significant losses and write downs on assets due to substantial increases in mortgage defaults and foreclosure activities. This also led to a loss of confidence by investors in the value of securitized mortgages and other credit related market instruments. These events resulted in a severe liquidity problem in the banking sector, the collapse of several major financial institutions and a dramatic reduction in credit availability. In the United States, the financial markets remained under duress due to the crisis and poor economic outlook. In September 2008, the liquidity and credit problem spread throughout the global financial market and evolved into a global financial crisis. Global markets have experienced unprecedented volatility. The value of equities outside the U.S. declined significantly, with appreciation of the U.S. dollar magnifying the losses in dollar terms. Although the U.S. and international governments coordinated efforts to stabilize the financial markets, the economic outlook was still uncertain and the global equity markets remained volatile. Our total assets under management declined 21% during fiscal year 2008, with over half of the decrease occurring in the fourth quarter. The negative market performance resulted in lower equity valuations, and $123.4 million of depreciation in our products for the year. Additionally, a shift in investor demand away from equities to lower risk investments led to a 37% increase in redemptions, although sales decreased only slightly. Net income decreased during the year, which was primarily the result of a decrease in other income, net. Diluted earnings per share also decreased, mainly resulting from the lower net income, partially offset by repurchases of shares of our common stock. 38 Table of Contents Despite the ongoing financial crisis, the performance of our sponsored investment products, in particular fixed income funds, was strong on a relative basis. Our simple monthly average assets under management increased 4% during fiscal year 2008, and our operating income increased 2%. We attribute this to the high level of assets under management at the beginning of our fiscal year, the diversification of our products and customer base and successful marketing campaigns. We have also taken steps to manage our business and our cost structure to respond to the market conditions. On October 6, 2008, Standard & Poors raised our long and short term credit ratings to AA and A 1+ from A+ and A 1, respectively. As fiscal year 2009 began, global markets continued to experience unprecedented volatility, and a challenging business climate is forecast for the foreseeable future. During October 2008, the market pressures resulted in a significant reduction in our assets under management, and accordingly, in our revenues and net income. We expect to continue to focus on the investment performance of our sponsored investment products and to provide high quality customer service to our clients. While we are focused on reducing costs, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop employees and invest in systems and technology that will provide secure, stable environments and economies of scale. We will continue to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker/dealer and client relationships. The success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report, and other factors as discussed herein. Results of Operations (dollar amounts in millions except per share data) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 2008vs. 2007 2007vs. 2006 Operating Income $ 2,099.0 $ 2,067.5 $ 1,633.4 2 % 27 % Net Income 1,588.2 1,772.9 1,267.6 (10 )% 40 % Earnings Per Share Basic $ 6.72 $ 7.11 $ 4.97 (5 )% 43 % Diluted 6.67 7.03 4.86 (5 )% 45 % Operating Margin1 35 % 33 % 32 % 1 Defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues. Operating income increased in fiscal year 2008, consistent with a 3% decrease in operating revenues and a 5% decrease in operating expenses. We experienced a period of sustained volatility in financial markets in fiscal 2008. Nonetheless, our operating revenues remained stable. In addition, we have taken steps to manage our business and our cost structure to respond to the market conditions. Net income decreased in fiscal year 2008, primarily due to a 65% decline in other income, net. The decrease in other income, net reflects a 38% decrease in investment and other income, net primarily due to lower realized gains on sale of investment securities, a decline in income from our investments in equity method investees, and lower interest and dividend income. Also contributing to the decrease in other income, net were net losses recognized by our consolidated sponsored investment products in fiscal year 2008, as compared to net gains in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in other income, net was partially offset by a 3% increase in investment management fees. Diluted earnings per share decreased in fiscal year 2008, consistent with the decrease in net income, partially offset by a 5% decrease in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from the Companys repurchase of shares of our common stock. 39 Table of Contents Net income increased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to increased fees for providing investment management and fund administration services, reflecting a 21% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management, and a 97% increase in other income, net primarily due to an increase in realized gains on sale of investments and higher gains from our consolidated sponsored investment products. These increases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses. Diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year 2007, consistent with the increase in net income and a decrease in diluted weighted average common stock outstanding. Diluted weighted average common stock outstanding was higher in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 (the fiscal year 2006) than in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the conversion of Liquid Yield Notes (zero coupon convertible senior notes) into shares of our common stock during fiscal year 2006. Assets Under Management Assets under management by investment objective were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) as of September 30, 2008 2007 2006 2008vs. 2007 2007vs. 2006 Equity Global/international $ 190.3 $ 286.7 $ 217.6 (34 )% 32 % Domestic (U.S.) 72.9 100.5 84.4 (27 )% 19 % Total equity 263.2 387.2 302.0 (32 )% 28 % Hybrid 93.9 117.2 90.6 (20 )% 29 % Fixed Income Tax free 59.7 59.0 55.6 1 % 6 % Taxable Global/international 52.7 44.3 25.5 19 % 74 % Domestic (U.S.) 30.5 31.8 32.4 (4 )% (2 )% Total fixed income 142.9 135.1 113.5 6 % 19 % Money Market 7.3 6.4 5.2 14 % 23 % Total $ 507.3 $ 645.9 $ 511.3 (21 )% 26 % Simple Monthly Average for the Year1 $ 604.9 $ 582.0 $ 482.4 4 % 21 % 1 Investment management fees from approximately 54% of our assets under management at September 30, 2008 were calculated using daily average assets under management. Our assets under management at September 30, 2008 were 21% lower than they were at September 30, 2007 primarily due to market depreciation of $123.4 billion during fiscal year 2008, as compared to market appreciation of $93.4 billion during fiscal year 2007. Simple monthly average assets under management, which are generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management and fund administration services than the year over year change in ending assets under management, increased by 4% during fiscal year 2008, as compared to fiscal year 2007. 40 Table of Contents The simple monthly average mix of assets under management is shown below. The change in mix during fiscal year 2008 is reflective of investor shifts to fixed income products resulting from equity market declines and volatility. for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 Equity 57 % 60 % 59 % Hybrid 18 % 18 % 17 % Fixed income 24 % 21 % 23 % Money market 1 % 1 % 1 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Assets under management by sales region were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) as of September 30, 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total 2006 % of Total United States $ 376.6 74 % $ 467.2 72 % $ 385.4 75 % Europe1 53.6 11 % 76.6 12 % 55.8 11 % Asia Pacific2 42.9 8 % 54.2 8 % 32.3 6 % Canada 34.2 7 % 47.9 8 % 37.8 8 % Total $ 507.3 100 % $ 645.9 100 % $ 511.3 100 % 1 Europe sales region includes Middle East and Africa. 2 Asia Pacific sales region includes Latin America. As shown in the table directly above, 74% of our assets under management as of September 30, 2008 originated from our U.S. sales region. In addition, 63% of our operating revenues originated from our U.S. operations in fiscal year 2008. Due to the global nature of our business operations, investment management and related services may be performed in locations unrelated to the sales region. Components of the change in our assets under management were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 2008vs. 2007 2007vs. 2006 Beginning assets under management $ 645.9 $ 511.3 $ 453.1 26 % 13 % Sales 181.5 185.5 128.8 (2 )% 44 % Redemptions (190.4 ) (139.0 ) (116.6 ) 37 % 19 % Net new flows (8.9 ) 46.5 12.2 NM 281 % Reinvested distributions 28.9 20.7 13.9 40 % 49 % Net flows 20.0 67.2 26.1 (70 )% 157 % Distributions (35.2 ) (26.0 ) (17.3 ) 35 % 50 % (Depreciation) appreciation and other (123.4 ) 93.4 49.4 NM 89 % Ending Assets Under Management $ 507.3 $ 645.9 $ 511.3 (21 )% 26 % Our assets under management decreased in fiscal year 2008 as global financial markets were significantly affected by the credit crisis and resulting financial crisis. The resulting market declines and volatility resulted in a shift in investor demand away from equities to lower risk investments. Despite this unsettled environment the level of product sales in fiscal year 2008 decreased only slightly from fiscal year 2007 levels. However, the level of redemptions increased 37%, resulting in $8.9 million of negative net 41 Table of Contents flows for the year. The declining performance of global equity markets also resulted in lower equity valuations, reflected in the $123.4 million of depreciation experienced by our products. During the more favorable market period of fiscal year 2007 our products experienced growth in net new flows and increased market appreciation. Investment Management Fee Rate The following table presents industry asset weighted average management fee rates1. Our actual effective investment management fee rates may vary from these rates. for the fiscal years ended September 30, Industry Average2008 Industry Average2007 Industry Average2006 Equity Global/international 0.60 % 0.63 % 0.67 % Domestic (U.S.) 0.47 % 0.47 % 0.50 % Hybrid 0.38 % 0.38 % 0.38 % Fixed Income Tax free 0.37 % 0.38 % 0.40 % Taxable Global/international 0.56 % 0.55 % 0.56 % Domestic (U.S.) 0.37 % 0.37 % 0.39 % Money Market 0.22 % 0.22 % 0.24 % 1 Industry asset weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from Lipper&reg; Inc. at September 30, 2008 and include all U.S. registered open end funds that reported expense data to Lipper Inc. as of the funds most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. As defined by Lipper Inc., management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity products are not included. For fiscal year 2008, our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management) decreased to 0.609% from 0.614% for fiscal year 2007. The decrease was primarily due to a shift in the mix of assets under management from equity products towards fixed income products. This change mainly resulted from depreciation and net new outflows of equity products, partially offset by net new inflows of fixed income products during fiscal year 2008. Generally, investment management fees earned on equity products are higher than fees earned on fixed income products. Our effective investment management fee rate was 0.614% for fiscal years 2007 and 2006. The effective investment management fee rate remained unchanged primarily due to a favorable change in the mix of assets under management, resulting from higher net new flows and greater appreciation for equity and hybrid products as compared to fixed income products, which was offset by a decrease in performance fees resulting from the divestiture of assets under management of a former subsidiary at October 1, 2006. 42 Table of Contents Operating Revenues The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category and the percentage of total operating revenues represented by each revenue category. Percentage Change Percentage of TotalOperating Revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 2008 2007 2006 Investment management fees 3 % 21 % 61 % 58 % 59 % Underwriting and distribution fees (12 )% 30 % 33 % 37 % 35 % Shareholder servicing fees 4 % 7 % 5 % 4 % 5 % Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net 40 % 1 % Other, net (33 )% 9 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Total Operating Revenues (3 )% 23 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. Investment management fees increased in fiscal year 2008 resulting from a 4% increase in simple monthly average assets under management, partially offset by a decrease in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in simple monthly average mix of assets under management from equity products towards fixed income products, which generally carry lower investment management fees. Investment management fees increased in fiscal year 2007 consistent with a 21% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a constant effective investment management fee rate. Underwriting and Distribution Fees We earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase. Sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor. Therefore, underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors. Globally, our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. Specifically, the majority of U.S. registered mutual funds, with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds, have adopted distribution plans (the Plans) under Rule 12b 1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (Rule 12b 1). The Plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares, such as expenses for marketing, advertising, printing and sales promotion, subject to the Plans limitations on amounts. The individual Plans set a percentage limit for Rule 12b 1 expenses based on average daily net assets under management of the mutual fund. Similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non U.S. funds and where, generally, the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions. We pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf. See the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below. 43 Table of Contents Overall, underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal year 2008. Underwriting fees decreased 32% primarily due to a 19% decrease in gross sales of Class A shares, mainly in the United States, and a shift in sales of equity products to fixed income products, which typically generate lower underwriting fees. Distribution fees increased 1% primarily due to a 4% increase in simple monthly average assets under management, partially offset by a shift in simple monthly average mix of assets under management from equity products to fixed income products. Distribution fees are generally higher for equity products, as compared to fixed income products. Underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal year 2007. Underwriting fees increased 36% primarily due to a 44% increase in gross product sales, including product sales that do not generate underwriting and distribution revenues. Distribution fees increased 26% consistent with a 21% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in equity products as compared to fixed income products in the simple monthly average mix of assets under management. Shareholder Servicing Fees Shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some instances, we charge sponsored investment products these fees based on the level of assets under management. We receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service, and tax reporting. In the United States, transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Approximately 1.7 million accounts closed in the U.S. during calendar year 2007 were no longer billable effective July 1, 2008, as compared to approximately 1.5 million accounts closed during calendar year 2006 that were no longer billable effective July 1, 2007. Approximately 237 thousand accounts closed in Canada during calendar year 2007 were no longer billable effective May 1, 2008, as compared to approximately 300 thousand accounts closed during calendar year 2006 that were no longer billable effective May 1, 2007. Shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 primarily due to 7% and 14% increases in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts, partially offset by an increase in shareholder accounts originated in Asia that are billable at a lower rate. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products Income, Net Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net reflects the net investment income, including dividend and interest income, of sponsored investment products that we consolidate in our financial statements. Consolidated sponsored investment products income, net increased in fiscal years 2008 and 2007. The increases reflect the investment performance and the net asset balances of the specific sponsored investment products that we consolidate each period. Other, Net Other, net revenue primarily consists of revenues from the banking/finance operating segment as well as income from custody services. Revenues from the banking/finance operating segment include interest income on loans, servicing income, and investment income on banking/finance investment securities, including realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments, and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for loan losses. 44 Table of Contents Other, net revenue decreased in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to increased net realized and unrealized losses on investments and provisions for loan losses, partially offset by an increase in interest income from automobile loans. Other, net revenue increased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to higher gains relating to securitizations of automobile loans, interest income on debt securities, and servicing fees from automobile loans, partially offset by a decrease in interest income related to our consumer lending business. Operating Expenses The table below presents the percentage change in each expense category and the percentage of total operating expenses represented by each expense category. Percentage Change Percentage of TotalOperating Expenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 2008 2007 2006 Underwriting and distribution (10 )% 32 % 49 % 52 % 48 % Compensation and benefits 4 % 15 % 28 % 26 % 27 % Information systems, technology and occupancy 1 % 5 % 8 % 8 % 9 % Advertising and promotion (3 )% 21 % 5 % 5 % 5 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 13 % 22 % 5 % 4 % 4 % Impairment of intangible assets (100 )% 2 % Other (17 )% 27 % 5 % 5 % 5 % Total Operating Expenses (5 )% 21 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Underwriting and Distribution Underwriting and distribution expenses include payments to financial advisers and other third parties for providing sales, marketing and distribution services to investors in our sponsored investment products. The decrease in underwriting and distribution expenses in fiscal year 2008 and increase in fiscal year 2007 are consistent with the changes in underwriting and distribution revenues during both periods. Underwriting and distribution expenses for fiscal year 2007 included a one time distribution charge of $12.7 million related to the termination of certain limited partnerships in Canada. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to annual merit salary adjustments that were effective December 1, 2007 and higher staffing levels. Another contributing factor was an increase in bonus expense, primarily resulting from the impact of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, in October 2006. These increases were partially offset by a one time pre tax charge of $16.4 million recorded in fiscal year 2007 and a decrease in costs related to matching contributions under our amended and restated 1998 Employee Stock Investment Plan. Compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to an increase in bonus expense, including bonus expense under the Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the AIP), pursuant to which bonus awards have been made, based, in part, on our performance. The increase also reflected annual merit salary adjustments that were effective December 1, 2006 and higher staffing levels. In fiscal year 2007, we recorded additional expenses for the repurchase of stock based compensation awards that previously had been recognized as a charge to capital in excess of par value, and for certain employee costs incurred in a business combination that previously had been recognized as 45 Table of Contents goodwill, partially offset by a reduction to expenses for a previously unrecognized receivable for the estimated refundable portion of workers compensation premiums. The impact of these adjustments resulted in an additional non cash charge of $16.4 million pre tax to compensation and benefits in fiscal year 2007. We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue. We employed approximately 8,800 people at September 30, 2008, as compared to approximately 8,700 at September 30, 2007. Information Systems, Technology and Occupancy Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased slightly in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to higher occupancy costs related to our existing offices as well as global expansion. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in external data services costs and technology consulting costs. Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to an increase in external data services costs, technology supplies and software, and higher occupancy costs related to our existing offices worldwide as well as global expansion. Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs, which exclude occupancy costs, are shown below. (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 Net carrying amount at beginning of period $ 61.6 $ 44.9 $ 42.7 Additions during period, net of disposals and other adjustments 32.5 42.0 26.1 Amortization during period (27.6 ) (25.3 ) (23.9 ) Net Carrying Amount at End of Period $ 66.5 $ 61.6 $ 44.9 Advertising and Promotion Advertising and promotion expenses decreased in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to decreased printing and global media advertising and promotion costs. Advertising and promotion expenses increased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to an increase in marketing support payments made to intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf in the United States. We are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and in order to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities, which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues. In addition to potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, advertising and promotion may also be impacted by changes in levels of sales and assets under management that affect marketing support payments made to the distributors of our sponsored investment products. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Certain fund share classes sold globally, including Class C and Class R shares marketed in the United States, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders, although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales. In addition, certain share classes, such as 46 Table of Contents Class A shares sold in the United States, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met, although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales. We defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from distribution and service fee revenues and contingent sales charges received from shareholders of the funds upon redemption of their shares. We evaluate DCA for recoverability on a periodic basis using undiscounted expected cash flows from the shares of mutual funds sold without a front end sales charge. The U.S. funds that had offered Class B shares and carried a deferred sales charge arrangement ceased offering these shares to new investors and existing shareholders at the end of fiscal year 2005. Existing Class B shareholders may continue to exchange shares into Class B shares of different funds and they may also continue to reinvest dividends on Class B shares in additional Class B shares. Historically, Class B and certain of our Class C deferred commission assets (DCA) arising from our U.S., Canadian and European operations have been financed through sales of related future revenue or other arrangements with Lightning Finance Company Limited (LFL), a company registered in Ireland in which we hold a 49% ownership interest. In December 2005, LFL transferred substantially all of its rights to this future revenue to Lightning Asset Finance Limited (LAFL), an Irish special purpose vehicle formed for this sole purpose, in which we also hold a 49% ownership interest. The holder of the 51% ownership interests in both LFL and LAFL is a subsidiary of an international banking institution which is not affiliated with the Company. As of December 2005, our DCA have been financed generally by an independent third party. Under the U.S. financing arrangements, the funds contracted with our U.S. distributor, which in turn contracted with LFL. As a result of our significant interest in both LFL and LAFL we continue to carry the DCA generated in the United States on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until these assets are amortized or sold by LAFL. Neither we nor our distribution subsidiaries retain any direct ownership interest in the future revenue sold, and, therefore, the future revenue is not available to satisfy claims of our creditors or those of our distribution subsidiaries. In contrast to the U.S. arrangements, the arrangements outside the United States are, in most cases, direct agreements with our Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and, as a result, we do not record DCA from these sources in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal years 2008 and 2007. The increases were mainly due to higher product sales with up front commissions in fiscal year 2007, primarily related to U.S. and Canadian funds. Impairment of Intangible Assets We completed our most recent annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 and we determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of October 1, 2007. We also believe, based on our October 1, 2008 impairment tests substantially completed to date, that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired as of September 30, 2008. In addition, no impairment loss in the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was recognized during fiscal year 2007. No impairment loss in the value of intangible assets subject to amortization was recognized during fiscal years 2008 and 2007. During the quarter ended March 31, 2006, Fiduciary Trust implemented a plan of reorganization designed to emphasize its distinct high net worth brand and to pursue further integration opportunities within Franklin Templeton Investments for its institutional business line. These changes to Fiduciary Trusts business required us to review the carrying value of acquired customer base intangible assets of Fiduciary Trust. As a result of these changes, we recorded a $68.4 million non cash impairment charge to customer base definite lived intangible assets of Fiduciary Trust in the quarter ended March 31, 2006. 47 Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses primarily consist of professional fees, fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, corporate travel and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other operating expenses decreased in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to litigation costs incurred in the prior year and lower consulting and professional fees. Other operating expenses increased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to higher litigation costs, fund administration services fees payable to external parties and consulting and professional fees, including additional costs related to the distribution of market timing settlements. Other Income (Expenses) Other income (expenses) includes net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) on consolidated sponsored investment products, investment and other income, net and interest expense from our investment management and related services business. Investment and other income, net is comprised primarily of income related to our investments, including interest and dividend income, realized gains and losses on sale of available for sale investment securities, income from equity method investees, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expenses) decreased 65% in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to net losses recognized by our consolidated sponsored investment products, driven mainly by market value declines in equity products, as compared to net gains in the prior fiscal year. Net realized gains on sale of investment securities, available for sale, income from equity method investees, and interest and dividend income also declined primarily due to unfavorable market conditions. Other income (expenses) increased 97% in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to higher realized gains on sale of investment securities, available for sale, gains on our consolidated sponsored investment products and income from equity method investees. Taxes on Income As a multi national corporation, we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international sponsored investment products, often managed from locations outside the United States. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the United States. The mix of pre tax income (primarily from our investment management and related services business) subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the United States, produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing U.S. federal and state income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2008 was 28.99%, as compared to 28.08% in fiscal year 2007 and 30.94% in fiscal year 2006. The increase in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to an income tax charge related to repatriated earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries and our mix of foreign earnings. The decrease in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to a fiscal year 2006 income tax charge of $105.5 million related to repatriated earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries under the Jobs Act, partially offset by increases in income tax liabilities in certain U.S. state and local tax jurisdictions The effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non U.S. earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income. On October 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies 48 Table of Contents the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a net decrease to beginning retained earnings of $20.8 million, which was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, with a corresponding $36.2 million increase to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, a $3.8 million increase to accrued expenses for interest and penalties, and a $19.2 million increase to deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2008, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $67.9 million. If recognized, substantially all of this amount, net of any deferred tax benefits, would favorably affect our effective income tax rate in future periods. During September 2008, we amended our repatriation plan for undistributed foreign earnings to include repatriation to the U.S. of the excess net earnings after debt service payments and regulatory capital requirements of our United Kingdom consolidated subsidiaries. As a result of the amendment, we recognized a provision for U.S. income taxes of $19.7 million and a net deferred income tax liability of $3.4 million in relation to $294.8 million of accumulated and current earnings from the United Kingdom, of which $210.9 million was repatriated as of September 30, 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital: (in millions) as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 Balance Sheet Data Assets Liquid assets $ 5,443.6 $ 5,834.0 $ 5,347.8 Cash and cash equivalents 2,527.6 3,584.2 3,613.1 Liabilities Debt Commercial paper $ 13.3 $ $ 168.1 Medium term notes 420.0 420.0 Variable funding notes 28.6 240.8 232.3 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 109.0 Other long term debt 118.4 162.1 207.9 Total debt $ 269.3 $ 822.9 $ 1,028.3 Cash Flow Data Operating cash flows $ 1,409.2 $ 1,673.6 $ 1,277.9 Investing cash flows (1,096.1 ) (306.2 ) 36.5 Financing cash flows (1,300.0 ) (1,449.2 ) (853.4 ) Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables, and current investments (trading, available for sale and other). Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, federal funds sold, time deposits and debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date and other highly liquid investments, including money market funds, which are readily convertible into cash. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2008 decreased primarily due to a $790.0 million increase in net cash used in investing activities and a $264.4 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities. At September 30, 2008, the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by our U.S. and non U.S. operations were approximately 51% and 49%, as compared to approximately 57% and 43% at September 30, 2007. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by our U.S. operations decreased primarily due to the repayment of medium term notes as discussed below under Uses of Capital. 49 Table of Contents The decrease in total debt outstanding during fiscal year 2008 primarily relates to repayments of medium term notes and variable funding notes, and amortization of other long term debt, partially offset by new Federal Home Loan Bank advances and commercial paper issuances. We experienced a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2008, primarily due to an increase in trading securities and a decrease in proceeds from the securitization of loans held for sale, partially offset by lower originations of loans held for sale. Net cash outflows in investing activities were primarily due to purchases of investments exceeding liquidations. Net cash used in financing activities was slightly lower in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to an increase in minority interest cash receipts in our consolidated sponsored investment products and bank deposits, partially offset by higher payments on debt in excess of proceeds and an increase in common stock repurchases. Capital Resources Notwithstanding current market credit and liquidity conditions, we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and the ability to issue debt or equity securities. In particular, we expect to finance future investment in our banking/finance activities through operating cash flows, debt, increased deposit base, and the securitization of a portion of receivables from consumer lending activities. At September 30, 2008, our current debt included commercial paper with a total face value of $13.3 million that was issued at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 2.50% and matured in October 2008. The banking/finance operating segment finances its automobile lending business primarily through securitizations, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and the issuance of variable funding notes under one year revolving variable funding note warehouse credit facilities. As of September 30, 2008 and 2007, we had $450.0 million and $250.0 million available under these facilities. In November 2008, we terminated a $250.0 million facility. The remaining $200.0 million facility expires later in November 2008; we do not intend to renew or replace this facility upon expiration. The variable funding notes issued under these facilities are payable to certain administered conduits and are secured by cash and a pool of automobile loans that meet or are expected to meet certain eligibility requirements. Credit enhancements for the variable funding notes require us to provide, as collateral, loans held for sale with a fair value in excess of the principal amount of the variable funding notes, as well as provide payment provider commitments in an amount not to exceed 4.66% of the pool balances. At September 30, 2008 and 2007, we held $1.6 million and $1.5 million of cash balances in trust to fulfill our payment provider obligations and recorded these balances as other banking/finance assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also entered into various interest rate swap agreements, accounted for as freestanding derivatives, intended to mitigate the interest rate risk between the fixed interest rate on the pool of automobile loans and the floating interest rate being paid on the variable funding notes. On June 13, 2008, we completed a securitization transaction of automobile loans with a carrying amount of loans sold of approximately $381.4 million for net sale proceeds of approximately $381.9 million and a pre tax gain of approximately $0.5 million. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the variable funding notes. At September 30, 2008, our banking/finance operating segment had $109.0 million of total outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Approximately $71.0 million of these advances mature in fiscal year 2009, while the remaining $38.0 million mature during the fiscal years 2010 to 2018. These advances had a weighted average interest rate of 3.56% at September 30, 2008 and are subject to collateralization requirements. 50 Table of Contents At September 30, 2008, we had $420.0 million in short term revolving credit available under a five year credit agreement with certain banks and financial institutions expiring on June 10, 2010, $486.7 million of short term commercial paper remaining available for issuance under an uncommitted $500.0 million private placement program, and $14.1 million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit. The agreement relating to the revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants. In addition, at September 30, 2008, our banking/finance segment had $314.0 million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the Federal Reserve Funds system, $176.0 million available in secured Federal Reserve Bank short term discount window and $6.0 million available in secured Federal Home Loan Bank short term borrowing capacity. In March 2008, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC as a well known seasoned issuer. Using the shelf registration statement, we may sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, our shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, debt securities, convertible securities, warrants or units. In October 2008, the FDIC announced a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The program, the terms of which are still subject to change, is designed to guarantee certain forms of newly issued senior unsecured debt, up to 125% of the amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2008 that were scheduled to mature before June 30, 2009. The program is also designed to provide full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts in FDIC insured banks until December 31, 2009. We are eligible to participate in the program and are currently evaluating whether to participate or opt out by the deadline of December 5, 2008. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. Uses of Capital We expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business, make strategic acquisitions, acquire shares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt. We repaid our five year senior notes due April 15, 2008 totaling $420.0 million at maturity using proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and available cash on hand. These medium term notes carried an interest rate of 3.70% and were not redeemable prior to maturity by either the note holders or us. Interest payments were due semi annually. We continue to look for opportunities to control our costs and expand our global presence. In this regard, in fiscal year 2005, we entered into a commitment to acquire land and build a campus in Hyderabad, India, to establish support services for several of our global functions. Our estimated total cost to complete the campus at September 30, 2008 was approximately $75.0 million, of which $65.6 million had been incurred as of this date. We inaugurated the opening of the campus in January 2007 and expect to complete the construction of an additional building in fiscal year 2009. On September 18, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share payable on October 15, 2008 to stockholders of record on October 6, 2008. We maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program is affected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. During fiscal year 51 Table of Contents 2008, we repurchased 14.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1,543.3 million. The common stock repurchases made as of September 30, 2008 reduced our capital in excess of par value to nil and the excess amount was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings. At September 30, 2008, approximately 5.1 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase program is not subject to an expiration date. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments. We believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities. (in millions) as of September 30, 2008 Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Non current debt $ 85.0 $ 30.8 $ 45.5 $ 8.7 $ Operating leases1 294.0 44.5 80.6 67.0 101.9 Purchase obligations2 235.4 92.2 91.5 51.7 Total Contractual Obligations 614.4 167.5 217.6 127.4 101.9 Loan origination commitments 175.3 136.4 7.0 5.0 26.9 Capital contribution commitments3 63.2 31.0 26.8 5.4 Total Contractual Obligations and Commitments4 $ 852.9 $ 334.9 $ 251.4 $ 137.8 $ 128.8 1 Operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements totaling $13.1 million. 2 Purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be cancelled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees. 3 Capital contribution commitments relate to our agreements to fund certain of our sponsored investment products. 4 The table excludes future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2008, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $67.9 million, and approximately $10.4 million of accrued interest (see Note 13 Taxes on Income to our Consolidated Financial Statements). However, because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of September 30, 2008, cannot be made. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are $1.7 million and $0.7 million. Contingent Obligations In relation to the automobile loan securitization transactions that we have entered into with a number of qualified special purpose entities, we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to note holders up to certain levels as specified in the related agreements. At September 30, 2008, the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these obligations was $49.0 million and the fair value of obligations arising from automobile securitization transactions reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2008 were not significant. At September 30, 2008, the banking/finance operating segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling $6.9 million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers, primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking 52 Table of Contents customers. These standby letters of credit were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of $8.8 million at September 30, 2008. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As discussed above, we hold a 49% ownership interest in LFL and LAFL and we account for the ownership interest in these companies using the equity method of accounting. As of September 30, 2008, LFL had approximately $2.5 million in total assets and our exposure to loss related to LFL was limited to the carrying value of our investment totaling approximately $1.2 million. As of September 30, 2008, LAFL had approximately $202.7 million in total assets and our maximum exposure to loss related to LAFL totaled approximately $100.2 million. We recognized pre tax losses of approximately $8.5 million and pre tax income of $3.7 million for our share of LFLs and LAFLs net losses and income in fiscal years 2008 and 2007. Due to our significant interest in LAFL, we continue to carry on our balance sheet the DCA and the related liability for the future revenue originally sold to LFL and transferred to LAFL until these assets are amortized or sold by LAFL. Neither we nor our distribution subsidiaries retain any direct ownership interest in the future revenue sold, and, therefore, the future revenue is not available to satisfy claims of our creditors or those of our distribution subsidiaries. As discussed above, our banking/finance operating segment periodically enters into automobile loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors (see Note 8 Securitization of Loans Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K). Our main objective in entering into these securitization transactions is to obtain financing for automobile loan activities. Securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled $851.8 million at September 30, 2008 and $749.8 million at September 30, 2007. The Company, in its role as agent or trustee, facilitates the settlement of investor share purchase, redemption, and other transactions with affiliated mutual funds. The Company is appointed by the affiliated mutual funds as agent or trustee to manage, on behalf of the affiliated mutual funds, bank deposit accounts that contain only (i) cash remitted by investors to the affiliated mutual funds for the direct purchase of fund shares, or (ii) cash remitted by the affiliated mutual funds for direct delivery to the investors for either the proceeds of fund shares liquidated at the investors direction, or dividends and capital gains earned on fund shares. As of September 30, 2008 and 2007, we held cash of approximately $185.7 million and $170.2 million off balance sheet in agency or trust for investors and the affiliated mutual funds. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position. For additional information about our accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. 53 Table of Contents In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. SFAS 142 also requires indefinite lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. We perform annual impairment tests in the first quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing a two step process. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units, and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow projections and models similar to those employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Indefinite lived intangible asset impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. In estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow projections to be derived from these assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), we test definite lived intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In estimating the fair value of intangible assets subject to amortization, we use valuation techniques based on undiscounted cash flow projections, without interest charges, to be derived from these assets. In performing our impairment analyses, we use certain assumptions and estimates, including those related to assets under management growth rates, investor attrition rates, discount rates, and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets, based on, among other factors, historical trends and the characteristics of the assets. While we believe that our testing was appropriate, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109), as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, computed pursuant to FIN 48 and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon 54 Table of Contents settlement. We recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses. As a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the United States and generate earnings from our non U.S. subsidiaries. We indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries, except for Subpart F income taxed in the U.S., subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions, and the excess net earnings after debt service payments and regulatory capital requirements of our Canadian and United Kingdom consolidated subsidiaries. As a result, we have not recognized a provision for U.S. income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on $3.1 billion of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at September 30, 2008. Changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non U.S. earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Valuation of Investments The Company records substantially all of its investments at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. The fair value of investments in securities generally is determined using quoted market prices, or independent broker or dealer price quotes. However, even where the fair value of a security is derived from independent broker or dealer price quotes, a valuation adjustment for certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For investments in illiquid securities, privately held securities, and certain retained interests in securitized assets, the Company estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow models using relevant assumptions based on observable market or independently sourced market information, and internal data. Investments are evaluated for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value. The Company considers many factors, including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost, the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer. When a decline in fair value of an available for sale security is determined to be other than temporary, the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2008 to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. See also Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities We are required to consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE) in which we are considered the primary beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). A VIE is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment 55 Table of Contents holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. FIN 46R requires consolidation of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. We evaluate whether entities are VIEs and determine if we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. These evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions. To determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of VIEs, we utilize expected cash flow scenarios that include discount rate and volatility assumptions that are based on available historical information and managements estimates. Based on our evaluation, we believe we were not the primary beneficiary of VIEs and, as a result, did not consolidate these entities as of and for the year ended September 30, 2008. While we believe that our evaluation was appropriate, future changes in estimates, judgments, and assumptions may affect whether certain related entities require consolidation in our financial statements under FIN 46R.

Risk Factors For a description of certain risk factors and other important factors that may affect us, our subsidiaries and our business, please see the description of the risk factors set forth under Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K, which is incorporated herein by reference. 57 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk, including, but not limited to, potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange and equity prices. Financial instruments include, but are not limited to, investment securities, deposits and debt obligations. Management is responsible for managing market risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks. Global markets have continued to experience unprecedented volatility, and a challenging business climate is forecast for the foreseeable future. Market conditions have resulted in a significant reduction in our assets under management, which directly impacts our revenues and net income. A continued economic downturn and volatility in the global financial markets could also significantly affect the estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in the valuation of our financial instruments. We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily through our loans receivable, investment in debt securities, deposit liabilities, variable funding notes and other outstanding debt. We monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources and, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure arising from the loans receivable portfolio and variable funding note liabilities. We minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities, and through diversification. In addition, we seek to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates. At September 30, 2008, we have considered the potential impact of a 2% movement in market interest rates on interest earning assets, net of interest bearing liabilities, total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities. Based on our analysis, we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations, for each of these categories or in the aggregate. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations. While we operate primarily in the United States, we also provide services and earn revenues in The Bahamas, Asia Pacific, Canada and Europe. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized since a significant portion of these revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the United States and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase. We are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value and investments held by sponsored investment products that we consolidate, which are also carried at fair value. To mitigate these risks, we maintain a diversified investment portfolio and, from time to time, we may enter into derivative agreements. Our exposure to market valuation risks is also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions, which allows us to mitigate the impact of changes in any particular market(s) or region(s). 58 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the effect of a 10% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at September 30, 2008.
