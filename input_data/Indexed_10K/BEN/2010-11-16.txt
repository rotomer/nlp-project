Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Statements In this section, we discuss and analyze the results of operations and financial condition of Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company). In addition to historical information, we also make statements relating to the future, called forward looking statements, which are provided under the safe harbor protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are generally written in the future tense and or are preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, seek, estimate, or other similar words. Moreover, statements that speculate about future events are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. You should carefully review the Risk Factors section set forth in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in any more recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), each of which describe these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail. While forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate 38 Table of Contents to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you against relying on any of these forward looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. If a circumstance occurs after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate, we do not have an obligation, and we undertake no obligation, to announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revisions to our forward looking statements, unless required by law. Overview We are a global investment management company and derive substantially all of our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to our retail and institutional mutual funds, unregistered funds, and to institutional, high net worth and separately managed accounts and other investment products. Our services include fund administration, shareholder services, transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services. Our sponsored investment products and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to the public globally under six distinct brand names: Franklin&reg;, Templeton&reg;, Mutual Series&reg;, Bissett&reg;, Fiduciary and Darby&reg;. We offer a broad range of sponsored investment products under equity, hybrid, fixed income and cash management categories that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management. As noted in the Risk Factors section set forth above in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the amount and mix of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income. To a lesser degree, the level of our revenues also depends on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. Our secondary business is banking/finance. Our banking/finance group offers select retail banking, private banking and consumer lending services through our bank subsidiaries. Our banking and consumer lending activities include consumer credit and debit cards, real estate equity lines, home equity/mortgage lending, and automobile lending related to the purchase, securitization, and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 (fiscal year 2010), market returns improved as the global economy emerged from recession and moved towards recovery. While global markets showed signs of stabilization, volatility remained throughout the year, most notably during our third fiscal quarter as the sovereign debt crisis in Europe led to more turbulent conditions. The overall improvement was evidenced by increases in the MSCI All Country World and S&P 500 indexes of 9% and 10% during the fiscal year. The recovery in the markets significantly benefited our assets under management, fee revenues and non operating income, all of which increased considerably during fiscal year 2010. Our total assets under management at September 30, 2010 were $644.9 billion, 23% higher than at September 30, 2009. The growth resulted from net new flows of $69.9 billion and market appreciation of $54.3 billion. Our simple monthly average assets under management for fiscal year 2010 increased by 29% over the prior year. Although the financial markets improved during the fiscal year, the business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain uncertain and subject to change. On July 21, 2010, President 39 Table of Contents Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Reform Act), which is expected to impose additional restrictions and limitations on our business. We will continue to review and evaluate the Reform Act and the extent of its impact on our business as the various rules and regulations required for implementation are adopted. The impact of the Reform Act on our financial position and results of operations, if any, is not known at this time. Uncertainties regarding the economic recovery remain in the foreseeable future. As we confront the challenges of this economic environment, we continue to focus on the investment performance of our sponsored investment products and on providing high quality customer service to our clients. While we are focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop employees and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. We will continue to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker/dealer and client relationships. The success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section in Part I of this Annual Report. Results of Operations (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 2010vs. 2009 2009vs. 2008 Operating Income $ 1,958.7 $ 1,202.6 $ 2,099.0 63 % (43 )% Net Income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. 1,445.7 896.8 1,588.2 61 % (44 )% Earnings Per Share Basic $ 6.36 $ 3.87 $ 6.68 64 % (42 )% Diluted 6.33 3.85 6.62 64 % (42 )% Operating Margin1 33 % 29 % 35 % 1 Defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues. Operating income and net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. increased in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a 39% increase in investment management fee revenues, which was driven by a 29% increase in our simple monthly average assets under management. Operating income and net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. decreased in fiscal year 2009, primarily due to a 32% decrease in investment management fee revenues. Adverse market conditions during the year led to a 27% decrease in our simple monthly average assets under management. We took actions to reduce our operating expenses in response to the market conditions and resulting revenue decreases, which contributed to a 24% decrease in operating expenses for the fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year 2010, consistent with the increase in net income and a 2% decrease in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from the repurchase of shares of our common stock. Diluted earnings per share decreased in fiscal year 2009, consistent with the decrease in net income, partially offset by a 3% decrease in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from the repurchase of shares of our common stock. 40 Table of Contents Assets Under Management Assets under management by investment objective were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) as of September 30, 2010 2009 2008 2010vs. 2009 2009vs. 2008 Equity Global/international $ 204.2 $ 183.1 $ 190.3 12 % (4 )% United States 69.5 63.9 72.9 9 % (12 )% Total equity 273.7 247.0 263.2 11 % (6 )% Hybrid 110.8 98.2 93.9 13 % 5 % Fixed Income Tax free 77.7 69.6 59.7 12 % 17 % Taxable Global/international 130.7 63.3 52.7 106 % 20 % United States 45.4 38.4 30.5 18 % 26 % Total fixed income 253.8 171.3 142.9 48 % 20 % Cash Management 6.6 6.9 7.3 (4 )% (5 )% Total $ 644.9 $ 523.4 $ 507.3 23 % 3 % Simple Monthly Average for the Year1 $ 571.1 $ 442.2 $ 604.9 29 % (27 )% 1 Investment management fees from approximately 56% of our assets under management at September 30, 2010 were calculated using daily average assets under management. Our assets under management at September 30, 2010 were 23% higher than they were at September 30, 2009, driven by positive net new flows of $69.9 billion and market appreciation of $54.3 billion during the fiscal year. The net new flows were primarily due to significantly higher sales of fixed income products, while the market appreciation related to both equity and fixed income products as improved market conditions led to significant valuation increases. During fiscal year 2009, assets under management increased 3%, primarily resulting from market appreciation of $25.4 billion, which occurred predominantly in fixed income products, partially offset by net new outflows of $5.5 billion. Simple monthly average assets under management, which are generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management and fund administration services than the year over year change in ending assets under management, increased by 29% during fiscal year 2010. The simple monthly average mix of assets under management is shown below. The changes in the mix during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 reflect a continued investor shift to lower risk investments. for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Equity 44 % 47 % 57 % Hybrid 18 % 19 % 18 % Fixed income 37 % 32 % 24 % Cash management 1 % 2 % 1 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 41 Table of Contents Assets under management by sales region were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) as of September 30, 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total United States1 $ 451.7 70 % $ 389.3 74 % $ 376.6 74 % Europe2 92.2 14 % 54.7 11 % 53.6 11 % Asia Pacific3 68.4 11 % 48.3 9 % 42.9 8 % Canada 32.6 5 % 31.1 6 % 34.2 7 % Total $ 644.9 100 % $ 523.4 100 % $ 507.3 100 % 1 Approximately 67%, 70% and 63% of our operating revenues originated from our U.S. operations in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. 2 Europe sales region includes Middle East and Africa. 3 Asia Pacific sales region includes Latin America and Australia. Due to the global nature of our business operations, investment management and related services may be performed in locations unrelated to the sales region. Components of the change in our assets under management were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 2010vs. 2009 2009vs. 2008 Beginning assets under management $ 523.4 $ 507.3 $ 645.9 3 % (21 )% Long term sales 188.5 110.4 170.0 71 % (35 )% Long term redemptions (122.8 ) (115.6 ) (177.9 ) 6 % (35 )% Net cash management 4.2 (0.3 ) (1.0 ) NM (70 )% Net new flows 69.9 (5.5 ) (8.9 ) NM (38 )% Reinvested distributions 11.5 14.1 28.9 (18 )% (51 )% Net flows 81.4 8.6 20.0 847 % (57 )% Distributions (14.2 ) (17.9 ) (35.2 ) (21 )% (49 )% Appreciation (depreciation) and other 54.3 25.4 (123.4 ) 114 % NM Ending Assets Under Management $ 644.9 $ 523.4 $ 507.3 23 % 3 % 42 Table of Contents Investment Management Fee Rate The following table presents industry asset weighted average management fee rates1. Our actual effective investment management fee rates may vary from these rates. for the fiscal years ended September 30, Industry Average2010 Industry Average2009 Industry Average2008 Equity Global/international 0.64 % 0.62 % 0.60 % United States 0.47 % 0.47 % 0.47 % Hybrid 0.39 % 0.39 % 0.38 % Fixed Income Tax free 0.37 % 0.36 % 0.37 % Taxable Global/international 0.54 % 0.53 % 0.56 % United States 0.38 % 0.38 % 0.37 % Cash Management 0.17 % 0.20 % 0.22 % 1 Industry asset weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from Lipper&reg; Inc. at September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and include all U.S. registered open end funds that reported expense data to Lipper Inc. as of the funds most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. As defined by Lipper Inc., management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity products are not included. Our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management) was 0.609% for fiscal year 2010, compared to 0.566% for fiscal year 2009 and 0.609% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 (fiscal year 2008). The increase in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to higher levels of global/international assets under management. The decrease in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of assets under management from equity products toward fixed income products. Generally, investment management fees on international products are higher than fees earned on United States products as they include fees to offset higher distribution costs, and fees earned on equity products are higher than fees earned on fixed income products. Operating Revenues The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category and the percentage of total operating revenues represented by each category. Percentage Change Percentage of TotalOperating Revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 Investment management fees 39 % (32 )% 59 % 60 % 61 % Underwriting and distribution fees 45 % (30 )% 35 % 34 % 33 % Shareholder servicing fees 6 % (8 )% 5 % 6 % 5 % Other, net 208 % (73 )% 1 % % 1 % Total Operating Revenues 40 % (30 )% 100 % 100 % 100 % Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products and sub advised accounts as a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. 43 Table of Contents Investment management fees increased in fiscal year 2010 resulting from a 29% increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a higher effective investment management fee rate. Investment management fees decreased in fiscal year 2009 resulting from a 27% decrease in simple monthly average assets under management and a lower effective investment management fee rate. Underwriting and Distribution Fees We earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase. Sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor. Therefore, underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors. Globally, our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. Specifically, the majority of U.S. registered mutual funds, with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds, have adopted distribution plans under Rule 12b 1 (the Rule 12b 1 Plans) promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act). The Rule 12b 1 Plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares, such as expenses for marketing, advertising, printing and sales promotion, subject to the Rule 12b 1 Plans limitations on amounts. The individual Rule 12b 1 Plans set a percentage limit for Rule 12b 1 expenses based on average daily net assets under management of the mutual fund. Similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non U.S. registered funds and where, generally, the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions. We pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf. See the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below. Overall, underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal year 2010. Underwriting fees increased 58% primarily due to an increase in commissionable sales. Distribution fees increased 39% primarily due to a 29% increase in simple monthly average assets under management. Total underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal year 2009. Underwriting fees decreased 25% primarily due to a shift in sales from equity products to fixed income products, which typically generate lower underwriting fees, combined with a 24% decrease in gross commissionable sales. Distribution fees decreased 32% primarily due to a 27% decrease in simple monthly average assets under management and a higher mix of fixed income assets. Distribution fees are generally higher for equity products, as compared to fixed income products. Shareholder Servicing Fees We receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service, and tax reporting. These fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some instances, we charge sponsored investment products these fees based on the level of assets under management. In the United States, transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Approximately 3.2 million 44 Table of Contents accounts closed in the U.S. during calendar year 2009 were no longer billable effective July 1, 2010, as compared to approximately 2.1 million accounts closed during calendar year 2008 that were no longer billable effective July 1, 2009. Approximately 235.6 thousand accounts closed in Canada during calendar year 2009 were no longer billable effective May 1, 2010, as compared to approximately 300.0 thousand accounts closed during calendar year 2008 that were no longer billable effective May 1, 2009. Shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a 4% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts and a favorable currency impact. The account increase was predominantly related to shareholder accounts originated in the United States. The favorable currency impact mainly resulted from a 13% increase in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Shareholder servicing fees decreased in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to an unfavorable currency impact and a 1% decrease in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts. The unfavorable currency impact mainly resulted from a 14% decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The account decrease was predominantly related to shareholder accounts originated in Canada and the United States. Other, Net Other, net revenue primarily consists of revenues from the banking/finance segment as well as income from custody services. Banking/finance revenues include interest income on loans, servicing income, and realized and unrealized gains (losses) on residual interests from securitization transactions, and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for loan losses. We have consistently followed our methodology in determining our allowance for loan losses, which incorporates current economic factors. Other, net revenue also includes the net investment income of our consolidated sponsored investment products, which is primarily comprised of dividend and interest income. Other, net revenue increased in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to gains from increases in the fair value of retained interests from securitizations of $3.4 million, compared to losses from decreases in fair value in the prior period of $46.0 million. The increase was partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in net investment income from our consolidated sponsored investment products. Other, net revenue decreased in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to a $41.1 million higher loss from declines in the fair value of residual interests from securitization transactions and a $21.8 million decrease in interest income from automobile loans, partially offset by a $12.4 million decrease in interest expense on swap contracts and a $7.6 million decrease in provision for loan losses. Operating Expenses The table below presents the percentage change in each expense category and the percentage of total operating expenses represented by each category. Percentage Change Percentage of TotalOperating Expenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 Underwriting and distribution 48 % (30 )% 51 % 45 % 49 % Compensation and benefits 13 % (14 )% 28 % 32 % 28 % Information systems, technology and occupancy 8 % (15 )% 8 % 9 % 8 % Advertising and promotion 36 % (37 )% 4 % 4 % 5 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 32 % (20 )% 5 % 5 % 5 % Other 13 % (23 )% 4 % 5 % 5 % Total Operating Expenses 30 % (24 )% 100 % 100 % 100 % 45 Table of Contents Underwriting and Distribution Underwriting and distribution expenses include payments to financial advisers and other third parties for providing sales, marketing and distribution services to investors in our sponsored investment products. Underwriting and distribution expenses increased in fiscal year 2010 consistent with the 45% increase in underwriting and distribution revenues during the year and an increase in distribution expenses relating to our international products. The decrease in underwriting and distribution expenses in fiscal year 2009 was consistent with the 30% decrease in underwriting and distribution revenues during the same period. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to increases in variable compensation and commissions, partially offset by a decrease related to severance costs incurred in the prior fiscal year. Variable compensation increased $116.8 million, mainly due to higher bonus expense based on our performance. Commissions increased $28.4 million, reflecting higher levels of sponsored investment product sales. Severance costs of $38.4 million were recognized in fiscal year 2009 related to reductions to our global workforce of approximately 10%. Higher salaries, wages and benefits during fiscal year 2010 resulting from annual merit salary adjustments, unfavorable currency impacts and higher benefit costs were largely offset by the impact of reduced staffing levels. The level of our global workforce throughout most of the year was lower than in the prior fiscal year. At September 30, 2010, our global workforce had increased to approximately 7,900 employees from approximately 7,700 at September 30, 2009. Compensation and benefit expenses decreased in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to declines in salaries, wages and benefits and variable compensation. Salaries, wages and benefits decreased $115.2 million, mainly resulting from lower staffing levels and a favorable currency impact. The decrease was partially offset by severance costs of $38.4 million. Variable compensation decreased $77.1 million. We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue. Information Systems, Technology and Occupancy Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to higher technology and occupancy costs related to our owned and leased offices and approximately $6.0 million in non recurring occupancy costs related to a property sublease. Information systems, technology and occupancy costs decreased in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to lower costs incurred for external data services, technology consulting, technology supplies, and occupancy. The lower costs resulted in part from our cost reduction efforts to defer non business critical initiatives and to reduce expenditures for contractors and professional fees. Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs, which exclude occupancy costs, are shown below. (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Net carrying value at beginning of period $ 65.2 $ 66.5 $ 61.6 Additions during period, net of disposals 34.0 30.2 32.5 Amortization during period (35.3 ) (31.5 ) (27.6 ) Net Carrying Value at End of Period $ 63.9 $ 65.2 $ 66.5 46 Table of Contents Advertising and Promotion Advertising and promotion expenses increased in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a $32.8 million increase in marketing support payments to intermediaries resulting from higher product sales and assets under management. Higher levels of advertising and sales promotion activities also contributed to the increase. Advertising and promotion expenses decreased in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to a $29.5 million decrease in marketing support payments to intermediaries resulting from lower product sales and assets under management. Also contributing to the decrease were lower advertising, sales promotions and travel expenses primarily as a result of our global cost reduction initiatives. We are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities. As a result of potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Certain fund share classes sold globally, including Class C shares marketed in the United States and Class B shares marketed outside of the United States, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders, although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales. In addition, certain share classes, such as Class A shares sold in the United States, are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met, although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales. We defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from distribution and service fee revenues and contingent deferred sales charges received from shareholders of the funds upon redemption of their shares. We evaluate deferred commission assets (DCA) for recoverability on a periodic basis using undiscounted expected cash flows from the shares of mutual funds sold without a front end sales charge. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal year 2010 mainly due to higher product sales with up front commissions, primarily related to U.S. funds. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased in fiscal year 2009 mainly due to lower product sales with up front commissions, also primarily related to U.S. funds. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses primarily consist of fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, professional fees, corporate travel and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other operating expenses increased in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a $14.7 million increase in fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, which resulted from higher average assets under management, and a $6.6 million increase in corporate travel expenses. Other operating expenses decreased in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to a $17.4 million decline in fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, which resulted from lower average assets under management, and a $16.4 million decrease in corporate travel and entertainment expenses resulting from our cost reduction initiatives. 47 Table of Contents Other Income (Expenses) (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Consolidated sponsored investment products gains (losses), net $ 8.5 $ 28.8 $ (60.2 ) Investment and other income, net 119.1 61.0 225.2 Interest expense (16.5 ) (3.8 ) (15.8 ) Other income, net $ 111.1 $ 86.0 $ 149.2 Other income (expenses) includes net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) on consolidated sponsored investment products, investment and other income, net and interest expense from our investment management and related services business. Investment and other income, net is comprised primarily of income related to our investments, including interest and dividend income, realized gains and losses on sale of and other than temporary impairments of available for sale investment securities, gains (losses) from trading investments, income (losses) from equity method investees, and foreign currency exchange gains (losses). Other income (expenses) increased 29% in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to higher investment valuations. The market recovery resulted in a $61.6 million decrease in other than temporary impairments on available for sale investment securities, a $24.2 million increase in net gains from trading investment securities and a $20.2 million increase in net realized gains on sale of available for sale investment securities. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $20.3 million in net gains from securities held by our consolidated investment products, $19.0 million in interest income, $14.6 million in net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), and $12.5 million in capital gain distributions. In addition, interest expense increased by $12.7 million, primarily related to $900.0 million of long term debt issued in May 2010. During fiscal year 2010, we re evaluated our accounting for investments in mutual fund sponsored investment products, which resulted in the deconsolidation of certain funds. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we recorded $12.8 million of related net gains recognized in earnings in prior years as a reduction to other income (expenses), primarily impacting consolidated sponsored investment products gains (losses), net. See Note 5 Investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Other income (expenses) decreased 42% in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to lower investment valuations during the first half of the year. The significant decline in interest rates and the global market downturn resulted in a $68.5 million decrease in interest income, a $49.2 million increase in other than temporary impairments on available for sale investment securities, a $26.7 million decline in net realized gains on sale of available for sale investment securities, and a $10.6 million decline in income from equity method investees. These decreases were partially offset by an $89.0 million increase in net gains from securities held by our consolidated sponsored investment products, resulting from improved market conditions during the second half of the fiscal year. Our investments in sponsored investment products primarily consist of the initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings; however we may also invest in our products for other business reasons. The market conditions that impact our assets under management similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our sponsored investment product investments. Taxes on Income As a multi national corporation, we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international sponsored investment products, often managed from locations outside the United States. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the United States. The mix of pre tax income 48 Table of Contents (primarily from our investment management and related services business) subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the United States, produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing U.S. federal and state income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2010 was 29.87%, as compared to 29.82% in fiscal year 2009 and 28.84% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to an increase in tax reserves as a result of new legislation, partially offset by a valuation allowance release for state net operating losses and a favorable international tax ruling. The increase in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of pre tax income from lower tax jurisdictions to higher tax jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non U.S. earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital: (in millions) as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Balance Sheet Data Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,123.7 $ 3,104.5 $ 2,527.6 Receivables 684.2 581.8 690.4 Investments 1,876.2 2,146.3 2,225.6 Total liquid assets $ 6,684.1 $ 5,832.6 $ 5,443.6 Liabilities Debt Commercial paper $ 30.0 $ 64.2 $ 13.3 Variable funding notes 28.6 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 51.0 57.0 109.0 Long term debt 898.9 118.4 Total debt $ 979.9 $ 121.2 $ 269.3 Cash Flow Data Operating cash flows $ 1,651.0 $ 641.4 $ 1,409.2 Investing cash flows (32.7 ) 289.9 (1,096.1 ) Financing cash flows (594.9 ) (340.6 ) (1,300.0 ) Liquidity Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables, and current and certain other investments (trading, available for sale, investments in equity method investees consisting of mutual fund sponsored investment products, and other). Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, non interest bearing and interest bearing deposits with financial institutions, federal funds sold, time deposits, securities of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less at the purchase date, and other highly liquid investments, including money market funds, which are readily convertible into cash. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2010 increased primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities. The percentages of cash and cash equivalents held by our U.S. and non U.S. operations were approximately 49% and 51% at both September 30, 2010 and 2009. The increase in total debt outstanding during fiscal year 2010 primarily relates to the issuance of long term debt in May 2010, partially offset by the repayment of commercial paper. 49 Table of Contents We experienced an increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2010, primarily due to an increase in net income, a lower increase in trading securities and an increase in operating liabilities. Investing cash outflows in fiscal year 2010, as compared to investing cash inflows in the prior fiscal year, were mainly due to a decrease in liquidation of investments and an increase in loans receivable, partially offset by a decrease in purchase of investments. Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to increased dividends paid on common stock and common stock repurchases, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt. Capital Resources We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and the ability to issue debt or equity securities. In March 2008, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC as a well known seasoned issuer. Using the shelf registration statement, we may sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, our shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, debt securities, convertible securities, warrants or units. In May 2010, we completed the issuance of senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes with a face value of $900.0 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the notes are available for general corporate purposes; a portion of the proceeds was used for the repayment of previously issued commercial paper. Of the notes, $300.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 2.000% per annum and matures in 2013, $250.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 3.125% per annum and matures in 2015 and $350.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 4.625% and matures in 2020. Interest is payable semi annually. The notes were issued collectively at a discount of $1.2 million that is being amortized over the term of the notes. We incurred approximately $6.4 million in debt issuance costs, which are included in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized over the term of the notes. The notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make whole redemption price. The indenture governing the notes contains limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. The indenture also includes requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another entity. As of September 30, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenants of the notes. The banking/finance segment secures advances from the FHLB to fund its retail banking and consumer lending services. At September 30, 2010, we had $51.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding. These advances had a weighted average interest rate of 3.62% at September 30, 2010 and are subject to collateralization requirements. At September 30, 2010, we had $470.0 million of short term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program, and $14.6 million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit. Our banking/finance segment had $295.0 million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the Federal Reserve system, $192.6 million available through the secured Federal Reserve Bank short term discount window and $56.1 million available in secured FHLB short term borrowing capacity. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, 50 Table of Contents interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. Uses of Capital We expect that our main uses of cash will be to expand our core business, make strategic acquisitions, acquire shares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt. On September 16, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share payable on October 8, 2010 to stockholders of record on September 30, 2010. We maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program is affected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased 6.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $675.8 million. The common stock repurchases made as of September 30, 2010 reduced our capital in excess of par value to nil and the excess amount was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings. At September 30, 2010, approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase program is not subject to an expiration date. The funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in kind redemptions, and lines of credit. While we have no contractual obligation to do so, we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments. We believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities. (in millions) as of September 30, 2010 Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Time deposits1 $ 121.6 $ 58.4 $ 52.3 $ 0.7 $ 10.2 Non current debt1 1,187.8 33.8 381.5 310.6 461.9 Operating leases2 238.4 44.1 77.6 61.7 55.0 Purchase obligations3 140.0 64.9 57.0 18.1 Total Contractual Obligations 1,687.8 201.2 568.4 391.1 527.1 Loan origination commitments 144.1 87.5 8.8 1.8 46.0 Capital contribution commitments4 96.9 41.2 38.9 15.2 1.6 Total Contractual Obligations and Commitments $ 1,928.8 $ 329.9 $ 616.1 $ 408.1 $ 574.7 1 Time deposits and non current debt amounts include scheduled principal and interest payments. 2 Operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements totaling $13.2 million. 3 Purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be cancelled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees. 4 Capital contribution commitments relate to our agreements to fund certain of our sponsored investment products. 51 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2010, our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million, and $18.5 million of related accrued interest (see Note 13 Taxes on Income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K). The amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are $14.0 million and $5.0 million. However, because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of September 30, 2010 cannot be made. Consequently, unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the table above. Contingent Obligations We are obligated to cover shortfalls for automobile loan securitization trusts that are structured as qualified special entities in amounts due to holders of asset backed securities up to certain levels. At September 30, 2010, the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees was $6.2 million and the fair value of the guarantees recognized as banking/finance liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was not significant. At September 30, 2010, the banking/finance segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling $9.1 million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers, primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers. These standby letters of credit were fully collateralized by marketable securities at September 30, 2010. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We previously held 49% ownership interests in Lightning Finance Company Limited (LFL) and Lightning Asset Finance Limited (LAFL). Due to our significant interest in LAFL, we carried on our consolidated balance sheets the DCA generated in the United States and the financing liability for the related future revenue we previously sold to LFL, which was subsequently transferred to LAFL. We repurchased the remaining DCA from LAFL in September 2009 and reflected this transaction as a repayment of the remaining financing obligation. We liquidated our ownership interests in LFL and LAFL during fiscal year 2010. Our banking/finance segment periodically enters into automobile loan securitization transactions with entities previously considered qualified special purpose entities, which then issue asset backed securities to private investors (see Note 8 Securitization of Loans Held for Sale in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K). Our main objective in entering into these securitization transactions has been to obtain financing for automobile loan activities. Securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled $320.0 million and $551.4 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009. We did not enter into any automobile loan securitization transactions during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, and do not anticipate entering into any new securitization transactions during fiscal year 2011. Effective October 1, 2010, we will adopt a new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standard that will result in the consolidation of the securitization trusts. See Note 2 New Accounting Standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. In our role as agent or trustee, we facilitate the settlement of investor share purchase, redemption, and other transactions with affiliated mutual funds. We are appointed by the affiliated mutual funds as agent or trustee to manage, on behalf of the affiliated mutual funds, bank deposit accounts that contain only (i) cash remitted by investors to the affiliated mutual funds for the direct purchase of fund shares, or (ii) cash remitted by the affiliated mutual funds for direct delivery to the investors for either the proceeds of fund shares liquidated at the investors direction, or dividends and capital gains earned on fund shares. As of 52 Table of Contents September 30, 2010 and 2009, we held cash of approximately $351.5 million and $214.5 million off balance sheet in agency or trust for investors and the affiliated mutual funds. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position. For additional information about our accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Measurements We use a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. The three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below. Our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of each quarter. Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data. Level 2 quoted prices are obtained from independent third party brokers or dealers, including prices derived from model based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Level 3 valuations are derived primarily from model based valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the market. We record substantially all of our investments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Trading securities and securities available for sale are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We may also measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These fair value measurements generally result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting for loans held for sale or write downs of individual assets. Level 3 assets represented approximately 2.1% of total assets measured at fair value at September 30, 2010, and there were no Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value. There were immaterial transfers into and out of Level 3 during fiscal year 2010. 53 Table of Contents The following is a description of the significant assets measured at fair value, the fair value methodologies used, and the fair value hierarchy level. Investment Securities, Trading consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products held for trading purposes, securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products and residual interests and retained subordinated securities from securitization transactions. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products, and they are classified as Level 1. The fair value of securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products is determined using quoted market prices, or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. These securities are primarily classified as Level 1 or Level 2. If events occur after the close of the primary market for any security, the quoted market prices may be adjusted for the observable price movements within country specific market proxies. Consolidated sponsored investment products may also hold securities that are classified as Level 3 because their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs. In these instances, we primarily employ a market based approach, which may use prices of recent transactions, various market multiples, book values and other relevant information for the investment or related or other comparable assets to determine the fair value of the investment. In developing this fair value, we may also give consideration to an income based approach valuation, which considers anticipated future cash flows of the investment and converts those amounts into a net present value. A discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the asset. The fair value of residual interests from securitization transactions is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using unobservable inputs, and they are classified as Level 3. The residual interests consist of interest only strips receivable and cash on deposit, and are backed by prime, non prime and sub prime automobile loans issued from March 1999 to April 2008. The fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. Key inputs to the analysis include the excess cash flow discount rate, cumulative life loss rate, expected weighted average life and prepayment speed assumptions. We develop our key inputs using our actual portfolio experience and recent market activity for similar transactions. The key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of the residual interests to an immediate adverse change in those assumptions are shown in Note 8 Securitization of Loans Held for Sale in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. The fair value of retained subordinated securities is determined using independent third party broker or dealer price quotes, and these securities are classified as Level 2. The broker or dealer price quotes are evaluated for reasonableness based upon the performance of the underlying loans and comparable transaction pricing in the securitization market. Investment Securities, Available for Sale consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products and debt securities including securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, securities of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities agency residential, and other equity securities. Realized gains and losses are included in investment income using either the average cost method or specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. The fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products and they are classified as Level 1. The fair value of debt securities is determined using quoted market prices, if available, or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes, which are evaluated for reasonableness, and they are generally classified as Level 2, except for certain U.S. Treasury securities which are classified as Level 1. The fair value of other equity securities, which consist primarily of non sponsored investment products, is generally determined based on the published net asset values of the investment products and 54 Table of Contents they are classified as Level 1. We may also hold other equity securities that are classified as Level 3 because their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs. In these instances we primarily employ the market based approach described above for Level 3 securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products. While we believe the valuation methodologies described above are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value. For available for sale equity securities, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer. When an impairment of an available for sale equity security is determined to be other than temporary, we recognize the impairment in earnings. For available for sale debt securities, if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost, we record the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of its amortized cost, we separate the impairment into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The credit loss component is the difference between the securitys amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and the losses related to all other factors are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary impairment in our portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Intangible assets consist primarily of mutual fund management contracts and customer base assets resulting from business acquisitions. We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to 15 years, using the straight line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. Indefinite lived intangible assets primarily represent contracts to manage mutual fund assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period. We make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our goodwill impairment test involves a two step process. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units, and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. We have two reporting units, investment management and related services and banking/finance, which are the same as our operating segments. All goodwill has been assigned to the investment management and related services reporting unit. 55 Table of Contents Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible assets, we use valuation techniques based on an income approach under which future cash flows are discounted. Our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about revenue and assets under management growth rates, the pre tax profit margin, the average effective fee rate, the effective tax rate, and the discount rate, which is based on our weighted average cost of capital. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the assets under management growth rate and the discount rate. We performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of August 1, 2010. We estimated the discounted future cash flows using a 6.0% compounded annual growth rate of assets under management and a discount rate of 14.3%. The fair value of the investment management and related services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 100%. The fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 100%. The assumptions used in our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were developed taking into account the ongoing volatility in the capital and credit markets. As a result, the growth rate assumption used as of August 1, 2010 was lower than the historical compounded growth rates. We did not recognize any impairment because our estimates of the fair values of our reporting unit and our indefinite lived assets exceeded their respective carrying values. A hypothetical 500 basis point decline in the assets under management growth rate or a 500 basis point increase in the discount rate would not cause either the investment management and related services reporting unit or the management contracts to fail the first step of the impairment tests for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets. We subsequently monitor the market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. We consider, among other things, changes in our assets under management and pre tax profit margin amounts, which affect our revenue growth rate assumptions, by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment test as of August 1, 2010. We also monitor fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. Subsequent to August 1, 2010, there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as we determined no events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. We test definite lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In evaluating the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from these assets. Our future undiscounted cash flow projections include assumptions about revenue and assets under management growth rates, effective fee rates, investor redemptions, the pre tax profit margin, and expected useful lives. The most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the change in the amount of assets under management. The assumptions used in our impairment tests are developed taking into consideration the ongoing market conditions. If the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, we measure the impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value of the asset is determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type. 56 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2010, approximately 90% of our definite lived intangible assets related to investment management contracts of Fiduciary Trust Company International (FTCI). The undiscounted future cash flow projections for FTCI institutional and high net worth management contracts exceeded their carrying values by approximately 25% and 10%, respectively. The undiscounted future cash flow projections for the other definite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 100%. We estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for all definite lived intangible assets using assets under management growth rates ranging from 6.4% to 6.0% depending on the type of management contracts. The assumptions used in our impairment tests for definite lived intangible assets were developed taking into consideration ongoing market conditions. As of September 30, 2010, a decline in the assets under management of approximately 900 basis points could cause us to evaluate whether the fair value of our definite lived intangible assets is below the asset carrying value. While we believe that our impairment tests and the assumptions used to estimate fair value are reasonable and appropriate, if the assumptions used in our estimates of fair value change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise accelerate amortization expense. Revenues We recognize investment management fees, shareholder servicing fees and distribution fees as earned over the period in which services are rendered, except for performance based investment management fees, which are recognized when earned. We recognize underwriting commissions related to the sale of shares of our sponsored investment products on the trade date. Investment management fees are generally determined based on a percentage of assets under management, except for performance based investment management fees, which are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts. Generally, shareholder servicing fees are calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced, while distribution fees are generally based on a percentage of assets under management. Assets under management is calculated for our sponsored investment products using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or adjusted market prices or price quotes. The fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies as appropriate for each security type. Securities for which market prices are not readily available generally represent a de minimus amount of our total assets under management. The pricing of the securities held by our sponsored investment products is governed by a global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events. While recent economic conditions have increased market price volatility, the fair value of the majority of the securities held by the sponsored investment products continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. Income Taxes We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition 57 Table of Contents threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses. As a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the United States and generate earnings from our non U.S. subsidiaries. We indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries, except for income previously taxed in the U.S., subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or contractual repatriation requirements, and the excess net earnings after debt service payments and regulatory capital requirements of our Canadian and U.K. consolidated subsidiaries. As a result, we have not recognized a provision for U.S. income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on $4.1 billion of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at September 30, 2010. Changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non U.S. earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2010 to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. See also Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities We consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) for which we are considered the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. The entity that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate the VIE. We invest in various entities in the normal course of business and evaluate whether each entity is a VIE. For the entities determined to be VIEs, we assess whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Our VIEs primarily include certain sponsored investment products and certain other investment products in which we hold an equity ownership interest. Other VIEs include limited liability partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures. The form of variable interests that we have in VIEs generally includes our equity ownership interest and investment management and related service fees earned from sponsored investment products. Our evaluation of whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of VIEs is highly complex and involves significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. We generally utilize expected cash flow scenarios to determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of VIEs from our investment management and related service fees or equity ownership interests held. The key estimates and assumptions used in our analyses include the amount of assets under management, investment management and related service fee rates, the life of the investment product, and the discount rate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. For example, assets under management are impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, contributions, withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily. Also, investment management fees may be fixed or tiered based on the amount of assets under management, the life of a sponsored investment product may be finite or indefinite, and the discount rate could be affected by credit, liquidity or other risks factors. In addition, third party purchases and redemptions, which are outside of our control, need to be evaluated to determine whether they cause a reconsideration event. 58 Table of Contents Based on our evaluation, we believe we were not the primary beneficiary of VIEs and, as a result, did not consolidate these entities as of and for fiscal year 2010. While we believe that our evaluation was appropriate, future changes in estimates, judgments, and assumptions may affect whether certain entities require consolidation in our financial statements. Effective October 1, 2010, we will adopt a new FASB standard that will impact our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs. As a result, we will consolidate certain VIEs that are not currently consolidated.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk, including, but not limited to, potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation. Financial instruments include, but are not limited to, investment securities, loans, deposits and debt obligations. Management is responsible for managing market risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks. We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily through our loans, investment in debt securities, deposit liabilities and other outstanding debt. We minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities, and through diversification. We minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates. In addition, our banking/finance segment monitors the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources and, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure arising from the loans receivable portfolio. At September 30, 2010, we have considered the potential impact of a 2% movement in market interest rates on interest earning assets, net of interest bearing liabilities of our banking/finance segment, total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities. Based on our analysis, we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in the next twelve months, for each of these categories or in the aggregate. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations. While we operate primarily in the United States, we also provide services and earn revenues in The Bahamas, Asia Pacific, Canada, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized in relation to our results of operations since a significant portion of these revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the United States and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in relation to our consolidated balance sheet mostly relates to cash and cash equivalents and investments that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Euro, Pound Sterling, Indian Rupee, and Canadian Dollar. These assets accounted for approximately 12% of the total cash and cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2010. We also have exposure to foreign exchange revaluation of U.S. dollar balances held by certain non U.S. subsidiaries for which their local currency is the functional currency. These assets accounted for approximately 3% of the total cash and cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2010. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risk exposure. As a result, both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income. We are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value and securities held by sponsored investment products that we consolidate, which are also carried at fair value. 61 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the effect of a 10% increase or decrease in the carrying values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at September 30, 2010.

Our exposure to these risks is also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions, which allows us to mitigate the impact of changes in any particular market(s) or region(s).
