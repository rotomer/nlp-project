Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Statements In this section, we discuss and analyze the results of operations and financial condition of Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company). In addition to historical information, we also make statements relating to the future, called forward looking statements, which are provided under the safe harbor protection of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are generally written in the future tense and or are preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, seek, estimate, or other similar words. Moreover, statements that speculate about future events are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. You should carefully review the Risk Factors section set forth in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in any more recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), each of which describe these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail. 30Table of ContentsWhile forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. If a circumstance occurs after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, we do not have an obligation, and we undertake no obligation, to announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revisions to our forward looking statements, unless required by law. Overview We are a global investment management organization and derive substantially all of our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide through products that include registered open end and closed end funds, unregistered funds, and institutional, high net worth and separately managed accounts (collectively, our sponsored investment products). Our services include fund administration, shareholder services, transfer agency, sales, distribution, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services. Our sponsored investment products and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to the public globally under six distinct brand names: Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series, Bissett, Fiduciary and Darby. We offer a broad range of sponsored investment products under equity, hybrid, fixed income and cash management funds and accounts, including alternative investment products, that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors. We also manage certain sub advised investment products which may be sold to the public under one of our brand names or that of other companies.The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management (AUM). As noted in the Risk Factors section set forth above in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income. The level of our revenues also depends on mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. Our secondary business is banking/finance. Our banking/finance group offers select retail banking, private banking and consumer lending services through our banking and finance subsidiaries. Our banking and consumer lending activities include consumer credit and debit cards, real estate equity lines and home equity/mortgage and automobile lending. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 (fiscal year 2011), overall market returns were mixed, as evidenced by a 4% decrease in the MSCI World Index and a 1% increase in the S&P 500 Index. The global economy recovered during the first half of the fiscal year, but stalled during the third fiscal quarter amid concerns about economic growth and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. During the fourth fiscal quarter the year to date economic growth was substantially reversed and volatility significantly increased amidst negative sentiment in the global financial markets following the downgrade of the U.S. Treasury debt rating and increased concerns related to European sovereign debt, resulting in decreases of 17% and 14% in the MSCI World Index and S&P 500 Index. Our average AUM, fee revenues and operating and net income all benefited from the growth periods during the year and increased significantly from the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 (fiscal year 2010). Our total AUM at September 30, 2011 was $659.9 billion, 2% higher than at September 30, 2010. Increases from $36.4 billion of net new flows and $12.5 billion from acquisitions were largely offset by $30.5 billion in market depreciation in the current fiscal year. As the market depreciation occurred primarily during the fourth fiscal quarter, our simple monthly average AUM (average AUM) increased 22% over the prior year. Long term sales increased 17% to $220.8 billion for fiscal year 2011, with more than 50% coming from outside the U.S. The increases occurred in all investment objectives with the exception of tax free fixed income, and remained strong in our global/international fixed income and equity products. However, redemption activity also increased in all investment objectives as a result of ongoing market volatility, and included $12.0 billion from one institutional advisory account in the first quarter of 31Table of Contentsfiscal year 2011. The business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain uncertain and subject to change. The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Reform Act) may impose additional restrictions and limitations on our business. We will continue to review and evaluate the Reform Act and the extent of its impact on our business as the various rules and regulations required for implementation continue to be adopted. Uncertainties regarding economic stabilization and improvement remain in the foreseeable future. As we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our sponsored investment products and on providing high quality customer service to our clients. While we are focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop employees and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. We will continue to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker/dealer and client relationships. The success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section in Part I of this Annual Report.

Operating income increased $756.1 million and net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. increased $548.9 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a 39% increase in investment management fee revenues, which was driven by a 29% increase in average AUM and a higher effective management fee rate. Diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, consistent with the increases in net income and 2% decreases in both years in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from the repurchase of shares of our common stock. 32Table of ContentsAssets Under Management AUM by investment objective was as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) 2011vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009as of September 30, 2011 2010 2009 Equity Global/international $185.8 $204.2 $183.1 (9)% 12 %United States 68.4 69.5 63.9 (2)% 9 %Total equity 254.2 273.7 247.0 (7)% 11 %Hybrid 101.3 110.8 98.2 (9)% 13 %Fixed Income Tax free 72.0 77.7 69.6 (7)% 12 %Taxable Global/international 178.8 130.7 63.3 37 % 106 %United States 46.9 45.4 38.4 3 % 18 %Total fixed income 297.7 253.8 171.3 17 % 48 %Cash Management 6.7 6.6 6.9 2 % (4)%Total $659.9 $644.9 $523.4 2 % 23 %Average for the Year1 $694.4 $571.1 $442.2 22 % 29 % 1 Investment management fees from approximately 59% of our AUM at September 30, 2011 were calculated using daily average AUM.AUM at September 30, 2011 was 2% higher than at September 30, 2010, driven by $36.4 billion of positive net new flows and $12.5 billion from acquisitions, largely offset by $30.5 billion in market depreciation. The net new flows were primarily due to higher sales of global/international fixed income products, while the market depreciation mostly related to global/international products in both equity and fixed income investment objectives as volatile market conditions during the fourth fiscal quarter led to significant valuation decreases. During fiscal year 2010, AUM increased 23%, driven by positive net new flows of $69.9 billion, primarily due to significantly higher sales of fixed income products, and market appreciation of $54.3 billion, related to both equity and fixed income products as improved market conditions led to significant valuation increases. Average AUM, which is generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management and fund administration services than the year over year change in ending AUM, increased by 22% and 29% during fiscal year 2011 and 2010. 33Table of ContentsThe average mix of AUM by investment objective is shown below. The change in mix towards fixed income products during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 reflects investor preference for globally diversified fixed income investments, partially offset by a decrease in demand for tax free fixed income investments. for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009Equity Global/international 32% 32% 34%United States 11% 12% 13%Total equity 43% 44% 47%Hybrid 16% 18% 19%Fixed Income Tax free 10% 13% 14%Taxable Global/international 23% 17% 11%United States 7% 7% 7%Total fixed income 40% 37% 32%Cash Management 1% 1% 2%Total 100% 100% 100%Components of the change in our AUM were as follows: (dollar amounts in billions)for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009Beginning AUM $644.9 $523.4 $507.3 23 % 3 %Long term sales 220.8 188.5 110.4 17 % 71 %Long term redemptions (184.8) (122.8) (115.6) 50 % 6 %Net cash management 0.4 4.2 (0.3) (90)% NMNet new flows 36.4 69.9 (5.5) (48)% NMReinvested distributions 16.3 11.5 14.1 42 % (18)%Net flows 52.7 81.4 8.6 (35)% 847 %Distributions (19.7) (14.2) (17.9) 39 % (21)%Acquisitions 12.5 NM NMAppreciation (depreciation) and other (30.5) 54.3 25.4 NM 114 %Ending AUM $659.9 $644.9 $523.4 2 % 23 %34Table of ContentsComponents of the change in our AUM by investment objective were as follows: (in billions) Equity Fixed Income for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2011 Global/International UnitedStates Hybrid Tax Free TaxableGlobal/International Taxable United States CashManagement TotalAUM at October 1, 2010 $204.2 $69.5 $110.8 $77.7 $130.7 $45.4 $6.6 $644.9Long term sales 53.3 19.6 21.4 9.5 102.8 14.2 220.8Long term redemptions (61.0) (19.1) (29.0) (14.3) (48.5) (12.9) (184.8)Net exchanges (0.5) 0.3 0.5 (1.9) 2.4 (0.5) (0.3) Net cash management 0.4 0.4Net new flows (8.2) 0.8 (7.1) (6.7) 56.7 0.8 0.1 36.4Reinvested distributions 2.7 1.6 4.2 2.2 4.3 1.3 16.3Net flows (5.5) 2.4 (2.9) (4.5) 61.0 2.1 0.1 52.7Distributions (3.3) (1.7) (5.2) (3.2) (4.6) (1.7) (19.7)Acquisitions 12.5 12.5Appreciation (depreciation) and other (22.1) (1.8) (1.4) 2.0 (8.3) 1.1 (30.5)AUM at September 30, 2011 $185.8 $68.4 $101.3 $72.0 $178.8 $46.9 $6.7 $659.9(in billions) Equity Fixed Income for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2010 Global/International UnitedStates Hybrid Tax Free TaxableGlobal/International Taxable United States CashManagement TotalAUM at October 1, 2009 $183.1 $63.9 $98.2 $69.6 $63.3 $38.4 $6.9 $523.4Long term sales 50.5 13.4 16.7 14.3 79.5 14.1 188.5Long term redemptions (47.0) (14.1) (13.2) (9.1) (29.2) (10.2) (122.8)Net exchanges (0.6) (0.3) (0.2) (0.1) 5.4 0.3 (4.5) Net cash management 4.2 4.2Net new flows 2.9 (1.0) 3.3 5.1 55.7 4.2 (0.3) 69.9Reinvested distributions 1.5 0.7 3.8 2.0 2.3 1.2 11.5Net flows 4.4 (0.3) 7.1 7.1 58.0 5.4 (0.3) 81.4Distributions (1.5) (0.8) (4.9) (3.2) (2.3) (1.5) (14.2)Appreciation and other 18.2 6.7 10.4 4.2 11.7 3.1 54.3AUM at September 30, 2010 $204.2 $69.5 $110.8 $77.7 $130.7 $45.4 $6.6 $644.9(in billions) Equity Fixed Income for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2009 Global/International UnitedStates Hybrid Tax Free TaxableGlobal/International Taxable United States CashManagement TotalAUM at October 1, 2008 $190.3 $72.9 $93.9 $59.7 $52.7 $30.5 $7.3 $507.3Long term sales 31.6 10.3 11.8 12.4 31.5 12.8 110.4Long term redemptions (39.3) (14.2) (13.9) (9.7) (28.9) (9.6) (115.6)Net exchanges (1.0) (0.5) (0.6) (0.2) 2.2 1.0 (0.9) Net cash management (0.3) (0.3)Net new flows (8.7) (4.4) (2.7) 2.5 4.8 4.2 (1.2) (5.5)Reinvested distributions 4.6 1.4 3.7 1.8 1.5 1.1 14.1Net flows (4.1) (3.0) 1.0 4.3 6.3 5.3 (1.2) 8.6Distributions (5.0) (1.8) (4.8) (2.9) (2.0) (1.4) (17.9)Appreciation (depreciation) and other 1.9 (4.2) 8.1 8.5 6.3 4.0 0.8 25.4AUM at September 30, 2009 $183.1 $63.9 $98.2 $69.6 $63.3 $38.4 $6.9 $523.435Table of ContentsAs discussed above, AUM increased $15.0 billion or 2% during fiscal year 2011. The net increase was almost entirely due to global/international fixed income products, which had continued strong sales throughout the year, partially offset by higher redemption levels and market depreciation experienced in the fourth fiscal quarter. The increase in fixed income products was significantly offset by decreased AUM in global/international equity and hybrid products, which had net new outflows in addition to fourth quarter market depreciation. Negative sentiment in the global financial markets in the fourth quarter resulting from the downgrade of the U.S. Treasury debt rating and increased concerns related to European sovereign debt served to more than offset the market gains from the first three quarters and led to a decrease in the MSCI World Index of 4% for the fiscal year. Total net new flows decreased 48% from the prior year. Long term sales totaled $220.8 billion, a 17% increase from the prior year, led by growth in global/international fixed income products. Long term redemptions increased 50% to $184.8 billion, with increases in all investment objectives, as a result of ongoing market volatility amid investor concerns about economic growth, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and default risk associated with municipal bonds. Redemptions included $12.0 billion from one institutional advisory account in the hybrid objective and losses of a few global equity institutional accounts.AUM increased $121.5 billion or 23% during fiscal year 2010, driven by $69.9 billion of net new flows primarily in global/international fixed income products and $54.3 billion of market appreciation across all investment objectives as improved market conditions led to significant valuation increases. The overall market improvement was evidenced by increases in the MSCI World and S&P 500 indexes of 7% and 10% during the fiscal year. AUM increased $16.1 billion or 3% during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 (fiscal year 2009), primarily resulting from $25.4 billion of market appreciation predominantly in fixed income products and $11.5 million of net new flows of fixed income products, partially offset by $15.8 million of net new outflows of equity and hybrid products.The average mix of AUM by sales region is shown below.

Growth in our international business reflects strong new flows in Europe and Asia. Due to the global nature of our business operations, investment management and related services may be performed in locations unrelated to the sales region.Investment Performance OverviewOur primary focus is on the long term investment performance of our sponsored investment products. A standard measure of the performance of a large group of these products is the percentage of AUM exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians. The performance of our equity and fixed income products was generally strong during the periods presented in the table below and our global/international funds frequently outperformed the benchmarks and peer group medians. Our global/international fixed income funds generated exceptional results with over 97% of AUM exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians for the three , five and ten year periods ended September 30, 2011. Our hybrid funds performance was also exceptional with over 95% of AUM exceeding peer group medians for all periods presented below.36Table of Contents Benchmark Comparison Peer Group Comparison % of AUM Exceeding Benchmark % of AUM in Top Two QuartilesAs of September 30, 2011 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 Year 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 YearEquity Global/international 37% 50% 52% 59% 62% 54% 56% 63%United States 30% 53% 53% 76% 35% 52% 43% 47%Total equity 35% 51% 53% 64% 54% 53% 52% 58%Hybrid 2% 97% 14% 96% 96% 99% 95% 97%Fixed Income Tax free 24% 35% 0% 0% 69% 61% 89% 92%Taxable Global/international 1% 98% 97% 97% 6% 100% 98% 100%United States 46% 73% 33% 48% 10% 28% 32% 46%Total fixed income 14% 77% 61% 60% 24% 78% 86% 88%AUM measured in the benchmark and peer group rankings represents 82% and 79% of our total AUM as of September 30, 2011. The benchmark comparisons are based on each funds return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the investment objectives of the fund. The peer group rankings are sourced from Lipper, Morningstar or eVestment in each funds market and asset weighted in U.S. dollars. Private equity, strategic emerging market and real estate advisor funds, cash management and recently acquired U.K. unit trusts and Australian equity funds are not included. Certain other funds and products were also excluded because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had this data been available, the results may have been different. These results assume the reinvestment of dividends, are based on data available as of November 11, 2011 and are subject to revision. While we remain focused on achieving strong long term performance, our future benchmark and peer group rankings may vary from our past performance. Operating Revenues In fiscal year 2011, we changed the presentation of our consolidated statements of income. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Amounts for the comparative prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category and the percentage of total operating revenues represented by each category. for the fiscal years ended September 30, Percentage Change Percentage of Total Operating Revenues 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 2011 2010 2009Investment management fees 27 % 39% 63% 61% 62%Sales and distribution fees 16 % 46% 32% 33% 32%Shareholder servicing fees 6 % 6% 4% 5% 6%Other, net (6)% 208% 1% 1% 0%Total Operating Revenues 22 % 40% 100% 100% 100%Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products and the sub advised products that we manage as a percentage of the market value of AUM. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. Investment management fees increased $956.8 million in fiscal year 2011. Approximately 87% of the increase was due to a 22% increase in average AUM, which was driven by net new flows from global/international fixed income 37Table of Contentsproducts and acquisitions, as well as higher valuation levels resulting from market appreciation across most investment objectives during the first nine months of the fiscal year. The increase in fees was also impacted to a lesser extent by higher fee rates as described below.Investment management fees increased $996.1 million in fiscal year 2010. Approximately 76% of the increase was due to a 29% increase in average AUM, which was driven by net new flows primarily from global/international fixed income products, as well as higher valuation levels resulting from market appreciation in all investment objectives. The remaining increase was primarily due to a higher effective investment management fee rate as described below.Our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by average AUM) was 65.3 basis points for fiscal year 2011, as compared to 62.6 basis points for fiscal year 2010 and 58.3 basis points for fiscal year 2009. The rate increases primarily resulted from higher levels and relative weighting of international AUM, which were driven by growth in cross border products. Generally, investment management fees earned on international products are higher than fees earned on U.S. products as they include fees to offset higher distribution costs. Performance based investment management fees were $63.9 million, $30.0 million and $9.4 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 and did not have a significant impact on our effective investment management fee rates. The following table presents U.S. industry asset weighted average management fee rates1. (in basis points) Industry Averagefor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009Equity Global/international 63 64 62United States 47 47 47Hybrid 40 39 39Fixed Income Tax free 37 37 36Taxable Global/international 56 54 53United States 38 38 38Cash Management 16 17 20 1 U.S. industry asset weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from Lipper Inc. as of September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and include all U.S. registered open end funds that reported expense data to Lipper Inc. as of the funds most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. As defined by Lipper Inc., management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity products are not included. Our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the U.S. industry average rates as we actively manage our products and have a higher level of international AUM, both of which generate higher fees. Changes to our effective investment management fee rates in the U.S. have not varied significantly from changes in industry rates. During fiscal year 2011 our U.S. hybrid rate increased by approximately two basis points more than the industry rate due to the loss of a $12.0 billion institutional advisory account that had a low fee rate.Investment management fees for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012 may decrease from fiscal year 2011 as our AUM at September 30, 2011 was lower than the average AUM for fiscal year 2011.Our product offerings and global operations are diverse. As such, the impact of future changes in the market value of AUM on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of investment objective, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets.Sales and Distribution Fees We earn fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales 38Table of Contentscommission at the time of purchase (commissionable sales). Sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor. Therefore, sales fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors. Globally, our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. Specifically, the majority of U.S. registered mutual funds, with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds, have adopted distribution plans under Rule 12b 1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Rule 12b 1 Plans). The Rule 12b 1 Plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares, such as expenses for marketing, advertising, printing and sales promotion, subject to the Rule 12b 1 Plans limitations on amounts. The individual Rule 12b 1 Plans set a percentage limit for Rule 12b 1 expenses based on average daily net AUM of the mutual fund. Similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non U.S. funds where, generally, the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions. We pay a significant portion of sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf. See the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below. Overall, sales and distribution fees increased $316.4 million in fiscal year 2011. Sales fees increased 2% to $752.0 million for fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a higher mix of commissionable equity product sales, which typically generate higher sales fees than fixed income products. Total commissionable sales increased 3%, however the increase had no impact on sales fees due to a higher mix of international products, which typically generate lower fees than U.S. products. Distribution fees were $1,511.5 million for fiscal year 2011, increasing 25% over the prior year primarily due to a 22% increase in average AUM and a higher relative mix of international AUM as discussed above in the Investment Management Fees section. Distribution fees on international products are generally higher than on U.S. products.Overall, sales and distribution fees increased $614.2 million in fiscal year 2010. Sales fees increased 58% to $738.0 million primarily due to a 74% increase in total commissionable sales partially offset by a higher mix of fixed income product sales. Distribution fees increased 40% to $1,209.1 million primarily due to a 29% increase in average AUM and a higher relative mix of international AUM. Shareholder Servicing Fees We receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service, and tax reporting. These fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some instances, we charge sponsored investment products these fees based on the level of AUM. In the U.S., transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Approximately 2.2 million accounts closed in the U.S. during calendar year 2010 were no longer billable effective July 1, 2011, as compared to approximately 3.2 million accounts closed during calendar year 2009 that were no longer billable effective July 1, 2010. Approximately 0.3 million accounts closed in Canada during calendar year 2010 were no longer billable effective May 1, 2011, compared to approximately 0.2 million accounts closed during calendar year 2009 that were no longer billable effective May 1, 2010. Shareholder servicing fees increased $16.9 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to an $11.8 million increase in Europe resulting from a change in fee structures that became effective on January 1, 2011, a 15% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts originated in Europe, and a 3% increase in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Shareholder servicing fees increased $2.3 million in the U.S. mainly due to a 9% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts, partially offset by the impact of account conversions to omnibus accounts that earn lower fees.39Table of ContentsShareholder servicing fees increased $16.5 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a 4% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts, predominantly related to shareholder accounts originated in the U.S., and a favorable currency impact mainly resulted from a 13% increase in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Other, Net Other, net revenue primarily consists of revenues from the banking/finance segment, net investment income from our consolidated sponsored investment products, and income from custody services. Banking/finance revenues include interest income on loans and servicing income and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for loan losses. Net investment income of our consolidated sponsored investment products is primarily comprised of dividend and interest income. Other, net revenue decreased $3.1 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to an $11.5 million decrease in banking/finance segment revenues, which included $3.4 million of unrealized gains on residual interests from securitization transactions recognized in the prior year, $3.1 million of prior year interest income related to retained interests from securitizations that were subsequently sold, and a $2.2 million decrease in interest income on debt securities. The decrease was partially offset by a $6.7 million increase in net investment income from our consolidated sponsored investment products. Other, net revenue increased $32.1 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a $39.9 million increase in banking/finance segment revenues resulting from unrealized gains on residual interests from securitization transactions of $3.4 million, compared to unrealized losses in the prior year of $46.0 million. The increase was partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in net investment income from our consolidated sponsored investment products. Operating Expenses In fiscal year 2011, we changed the presentation of our consolidated statements of income. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Amounts for the comparative prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The table below presents the percentage change in each operating expense category and the percentage of total operating expenses represented by each category.for the fiscal years ended September 30, Percentage Change Percentage of Total Operating Expenses 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 2011 2010 2009Sales, distribution and marketing 19 % 47% 61% 59% 52%Compensation and benefits 14 % 13% 27% 28% 32%Information systems and technology 5 % 6% 4% 4% 5%Occupancy 1 % 11% 3% 3% 4%General, administrative and other (1)% 14% 5% 6% 7%Total Operating Expenses 15 % 30% 100% 100% 100% Sales, Distribution and Marketing Sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily consist of payments to financial advisers, broker/dealers and other third parties for providing services to investors in our sponsored investment products, including marketing support services. These payments are generally determined as percentages of either AUM or sales. Also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to up front commissions on shares sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders. The deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from distribution fee revenues and contingent sales charges received from shareholders of the funds upon redemption of their shares. 40Table of ContentsSales, distribution and marketing expenses by cost driver are presented below:(dollar amounts in millions) Percentage Changefor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009Asset based expenses $1,881.8 $1,418.2 $1,002.1 33 % 42%Sales based expenses 675.8 676.0 407.8 0 % 66%Amortization of deferred sales commissions 155.2 188.7 143.0 (18)% 32%Sales, Distribution and Marketing $2,712.8 $2,282.9 $1,552.9 19 % 47%Asset based expenses increased $463.6 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a $331.7 million increase in distribution expenses on international products resulting from a 41% increase in average international AUM, and a $117.0 million increase in distribution expenses on U.S. products resulting from a 14% increase in average U.S. AUM. Asset based expenses increased $416.1 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a $249.5 million increase in distribution expenses on international products resulting from a 45% increase in average international AUM, and a $145.2 million increase in distribution expenses on U.S. products resulting from a 23% increase in average U.S. AUM. Distribution expenses, which are typically higher for international products, are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to international fee structures which provide for recovery of certain distribution costs through investment management fees.Sales based expenses decreased $0.2 million in fiscal year 2011. Total commissionable sales increased 3%, however higher international product sales were substantially offset by lower U.S. product sales and resulted in essentially flat sales commission expenses. International products typically generate lower commissions than U.S. products. Sales based expenses increased $268.2 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a 74% increase in commissionable sales. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $33.5 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a $30.1 million decrease related to U.S. Class B shares, which were fully amortized during the year. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $45.7 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a $44.2 million increase related to higher sales of U.S. Class A and C shares sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefit expenses increased $150.2 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to increases in variable compensation and salaries, wages and benefits. Variable compensation increased $79.0 million, mainly due to higher bonus expense based on our performance and a $7.0 million increase related to private equity performance fees. Salaries, wages and benefits increased $74.6 million, primarily due to a $49.7 million increase in salaries and wages resulting from higher staffing levels, annual merit salary adjustments and unfavorable currency impacts, as well as an increase of $16.5 million in 401(k) plan matching contributions. At September 30, 2011, our global workforce had increased to approximately 8,500 employees from approximately 7,900 employees at September 30, 2010.Compensation and benefit expenses increased $122.5 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to increases in variable compensation and commissions, partially offset by a decrease related to severance costs incurred in the prior fiscal year. Variable compensation increased $116.8 million, mainly due to higher bonus expense based on our performance. Commissions increased $28.4 million, reflecting higher levels of sponsored investment product sales. Severance costs of $38.4 million were recognized in fiscal year 2009 related to reductions to our global workforce of approximately 10%. Higher salaries, wages and benefits during fiscal year 2010 resulting from annual merit salary adjustments, unfavorable currency impacts and higher benefit costs were largely offset by the impact of reduced staffing levels. The level of our global workforce throughout most of the year was lower than in the prior fiscal year. We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefit expenses going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue. 41Table of ContentsInformation Systems and Technology Information systems and technology costs increased $7.5 million and $8.7 million in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 primarily due to higher investments in strategic technology projects for operational and regulatory purposes.Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs are shown below.

Occupancy costs include rent and other facilities related costs including depreciation and utilities.Occupancy costs increased $1.0 million and $12.7 million in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 primarily due to facility improvement costs. Occupancy costs for fiscal year 2010 included approximately $6.0 million of non recurring costs related to a property sublease.General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other operating expenses primarily consist of fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, advertising and promotion costs, corporate travel and entertainment, professional fees, and other miscellaneous expenses. General, administrative and other operating expenses decreased $2.7 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to $38.5 million of net insurance recoveries for losses incurred in prior years, which were substantially offset by various expense increases. Fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties increased $10.6 million due to higher average AUM and consulting fees related to private equity performance fees increased $10.2 million. In addition, advertising and sales and promotion expenses increased $10.1 million and corporate travel expenses increased $5.8 million due to higher levels of business activity. General, administrative and other operating expenses increased $28.9 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, which resulted from higher average AUM, a $7.4 million increase in advertising and sales and promotion expenses, and a $6.6 million increase in corporate travel expenses. We are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities. As a result of potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues.Other Income (Expenses) (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009Investment and other income, net $37.9 $119.1 $61.0Consolidated sponsored investment products gains (losses), net (36.1) 8.5 28.8Interest expense (37.4) (16.5) (3.8)Other income (expenses), net $(35.6) $111.1 $86.0Other income (expenses) includes net investment and other income, net realized and unrealized investment gains 42Table of Contents(losses) on consolidated sponsored investment products, and interest expense from our investment management and related services business. Net investment and other income is comprised primarily of income related to our investments, including interest and dividends, gains (losses) from trading investments, realized gains (losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, gains (losses) of assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), income (losses) from equity method investees, other than temporary impairments and foreign currency exchange gains (losses). Other income (expenses) decreased $146.7 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to market valuation losses, partially offset by higher realized gains. Lower market valuations resulted in $80.0 million of net losses from the changes in fair value of the assets and liabilities of consolidated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) recognized in the current year due to implementation of new accounting guidance related to consolidation of VIEs and in $36.1 million of net losses from securities held by our consolidated sponsored investment products as compared to $8.5 million of net gains in the prior year. Lower market valuations also resulted in a $31.7 million decrease in net gains on trading investment securities, a $21.0 million decrease in income from equity method investees and a $12.1 million increase in other than temporary impairments on certain available for sale and other equity investments. In addition, interest expense increased by $20.9 million, primarily due to $900 million of long term debt issued in May 2010. These decreases were partially offset by a $47.6 million increase in realized gains on available for sale investment securities. Substantially all of the net losses of the consolidated CLOs and a significant noncontrolling percentage of the net losses from consolidated sponsored investment products are offset in nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income. Other income (expenses) increased $25.1 million in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to higher investment valuations. Recovery in the financial markets resulted in a $61.6 million decrease in other than temporary impairments on available for sale investment securities, a $24.2 million increase in net gains from trading investment securities and a $20.2 million increase in net realized gains on sale of available for sale investment securities. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $20.3 million in net gains from securities held by our consolidated investment products, $19.0 million in interest income, $14.6 million in net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), and $12.5 million in capital gain distributions. In addition, interest expense increased by $12.7 million, primarily related to the long term debt issued in May 2010. Our investments in sponsored investment products include initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings, as well as investments for other business reasons. The market conditions that impact our AUM similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our sponsored investment product investments. Taxes on Income As a multi national corporation, we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international sponsored investment products, often managed from locations outside the U.S. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the U.S. The mix of pre tax income (primarily from our investment management and related services business) subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the U.S., produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing U.S. federal and state income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2011 was 30.62% as compared to 29.87% in fiscal year 2010 and 29.82% in fiscal year 2009. The increase in fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the recognition of higher tax reserves in the prior year resulting from new legislation. The increase in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the increase in tax reserves, partially offset by a valuation allowance release for state net operating losses and a favorable international tax ruling. The effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non U.S. earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income. Changes in tax rates in these jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and earnings.43Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our cash flows and uses of capital: (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009Cash Flow Data Operating cash flows $1,621.8 $1,651.0 $641.4Investing cash flows 435.9 (32.7) 289.9Financing cash flows (968.2) (594.9) (340.6)Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2011, despite an increase in net income, due to higher purchases of trading securities, a decrease in income taxes payable and higher net gains on sales of assets, partially offset by net losses of consolidated variable interest entities. Investing cash inflows in fiscal year 2011, as compared to investing cash outflows in the prior fiscal year, were mainly due to higher liquidations of investments, net of purchases, and a decrease in loans receivable held by consolidated variable interest entities, net. Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to proceeds from issuance of debt in the prior fiscal year, repayment of debt by consolidated VIEs, and higher repurchases of common stock, substantially offset by lower dividends paid on common stock, an increase in deposits, and higher net subscriptions of noncontrolling interests.The assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs, which consist of CLOs and automobile loan securitization trusts, as well as consolidated sponsored investment products in the form of limited partnerships and similar structures, do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no right to these entities assets, beyond our direct investment in, and management fees generated from these entities, which are eliminated upon consolidation. The debt holders of these entities have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment in these entities. We bear no risks associated with these liabilities and, therefore, do not consider them to be our obligations. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs and consolidated sponsored investment products in the form of limited partnerships and similar structures are excluded from the discussion below.The following table summarizes certain key balance sheet data relating to our liquidity and debt: (in millions) as of September 30, 2011 2010 2009Assets Cash and cash equivalents $5,033.1 $4,123.7 $3,104.5Receivables 746.8 684.2 581.8Investments 2,206.6 1,876.2 2,146.3Total liquid assets $7,986.5 $6,684.1 $5,832.6Liabilities Debt Commercial paper $30.0 $30.0 $64.2Federal Home Loan Bank advances 69.0 51.0 57.0Long term debt 899.2 898.9 Total debt $998.2 $979.9 $121.2Liquidity Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables, and current and certain other investments (trading, available for sale, investments in equity method investees consisting of mutual fund sponsored investment products, and other). Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, non interest bearing and interest bearing deposits with financial institutions, federal funds sold, time deposits, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, securities of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less 44Table of Contentsat the purchase date and other highly liquid investments, including money market funds, which are readily convertible into cash. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2011 increased primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and investing activities, partially offset by net cash used in financing activities. The percentages of cash and cash equivalents held by our U.S. and non U.S. operations were 45% and 55% at September 30, 2011, as compared to 49% and 51% at September 30, 2010. We utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to fund operational and regulatory requirements and capital contributions relating to our sponsored investment products. Certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of capital which are partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents. As a result, such subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. Also, as a multi national corporation, we operate in various locations outside of the U.S. Certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or requirements. Such restrictions and requirements limit our ability to transfer cash between various international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the U.S. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated domestically, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases, or we could elect to repatriate future earnings from non U.S. jurisdictions or raise capital through debt or equity issuance. Certain of these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense or other dilution to our earnings. As of September 30, 2011 our U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $2,140.4 million and $1,933.5 million of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and capital contributions to our sponsored investment products.Capital Resources We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities. At September 30, 2011, our outstanding commercial paper had a total face value of $30.0 million and a weighted average annualized interest rate of 0.16%.The banking/finance segment secures advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) to fund its retail banking and consumer lending services. At September 30, 2011, we had $69.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding. These advances had a weighted average interest rate of 3.30% at September 30, 2011 and are subject to collateralization requirements. In May 2010, we issued senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes with a face value of $900.0 million. Of the notes, $300.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 2.000% per annum and matures in 2013, $250.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 3.125% per annum and matures in 2015, and $350.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 4.625% and matures in 2020. Interest is payable semi annually. The indenture governing the notes contains limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. As of September 30, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants of the notes. At September 30, 2011, we had $470.0 million of short term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program, and $14.3 million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit. Our banking/finance segment had $245.0 million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the Federal Reserve system, $153.2 million available through the secured Federal Reserve Bank short term discount window and $25.0 million available in secured FHLB short term borrowing capacity. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. Uses of Capital We expect that our main uses of cash will be to expand our core business, make strategic acquisitions, acquire 45Table of Contentsshares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, invest in our sponsored investment products, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt. On September 15, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share which was payable on October 14, 2011 to stockholders of record on September 30, 2011. In July 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Balanced Equity Management Pty. Limited (BEM), a specialty Australian equity manager, for $53.7 million in cash and 85,000 shares of Franklin common stock with an aggregate value of $11.4 million at the acquisition date, for a total purchase consideration of $65.1 million.In January 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Rensburg Fund Management Limited, a specialty U.K. equity manager, for $72.9 million in cash. In December 2010, we purchased an office building to be used in business operations in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $29.7 million in cash.During fiscal year 2011, we invested $264.0 million, net of redemptions, in our sponsored investment products.We maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. During fiscal year 2011, we repurchased 8.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $954.2 million. The common stock repurchases made as of September 30, 2011 reduced our capital in excess of par value to nil and the excess amount was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings. At September 30, 2011, approximately 4.7 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase program is not subject to an expiration date. The funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in kind redemptions, and lines of credit. While we have no contractual obligation to do so, we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. 46Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments. We believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities.

The debt holders of consolidated sponsored investment products have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment in these entities. On October 1, 2010, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to the consolidation of VIEs. The adoption of the guidance resulted in the consolidation of VIEs that were not previously consolidated with long term debt of $1,278.1 million as of October 1, 2010. The debt holders of the VIEs have recourse only to the corresponding collateralized assets of the VIEs. See Note 2 New Accounting Guidance, Note 6 Variable Interest Entities, and Note 13 Debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K.As of September 30, 2011, our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $99.7 million, and related accrued interest of $20.3 million (see Note 14 Taxes on Income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K). The amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are $16.7 million and $6.4 million. However, because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of September 30, 2011 cannot be made. Consequently, unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the table above. Contingent Obligations We are obligated to cover shortfalls for the consolidated automobile loan securitization trusts in amounts due to the holders of asset backed securities up to certain levels. At September 30, 2011, the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees was $3.8 million and the fair value of the guarantees recognized as banking/finance liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was not significant. At September 30, 2011, the banking/finance segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling $9.7 47Table of Contentsmillion on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers, primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers. These standby letters of credit were fully collateralized by marketable securities at September 30, 2011. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In our role as agent or trustee, we facilitate the settlement of investor share purchase, redemption, and other transactions with affiliated mutual funds. We are appointed by the affiliated mutual funds as agent or trustee to manage, on behalf of the affiliated mutual funds, bank deposit accounts that contain only (i) cash remitted by investors to the affiliated mutual funds for the direct purchase of fund shares, or (ii) cash remitted by the affiliated mutual funds for direct delivery to the investors for either the proceeds of fund shares liquidated at the investors direction, or dividends and capital gains earned on fund shares. As of September 30, 2011 and 2010, we held cash of approximately $124.5 million and $351.5 million off balance sheet in agency or trust for investors and the affiliated mutual funds. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position. For additional information about our accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Consolidation We consolidate our subsidiaries and sponsored investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest. We are generally considered to have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in an entity. We also consolidate VIEs for which we are considered the primary beneficiary and non VIE limited partnerships and similar structures for which we are deemed to have control.A VIE is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. We provide investment management services to various investment entities that we sponsor in the normal course of business. We also invest in various entities in the normal course of business. Certain of these entities are considered to be VIEs.The assessment of whether an entity is a VIE or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure by structure basis. When performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entitys legal organization and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. A limited partnership or similar structure entity for which we are the general partner or managing member, our aggregate investment is not substantive and the limited partners or other investors do not have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member or to otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity is a VIE. Otherwise the entity is a VOE and we are presumed to control the entity unless the limited partners or other investors have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member or to otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity.We use two different models for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of VIEs. For all investment entities with the exception of CLOs, we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership. For all other VIEs, including CLOs, we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.The variable interests that we have in investment entity VIEs, other than CLOs, generally consist of our equity ownership interest in and investment management and related service fees earned from these VIEs. We use expected cash flow scenarios to determine if our investment management and related service fees and or equity ownership 48Table of Contentsinterests provide us with a majority of the VIEs expected losses or residual returns. Based on our evaluation, we determined we were not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and, as a result, did not consolidate these entities as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2011.We provide collateral management services to CLOs which are considered VIEs. These CLOs are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of assets, primarily corporate loans and, to a lesser extent, high yield bonds. We generally earn management fees in the form of senior and subordinated management fees from the CLOs based on the par value of outstanding investments and, in certain instances, may also receive performance based fees. In addition, we hold equity interests in certain of these investment vehicles. We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the CLOs as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the CLOs economic performance in our role as collateral manager and hold a variable interest for which we have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the CLOs.In previous years we entered into automobile loan securitization transactions with securitization trusts, which then issued asset backed securities to private investors. We retained certain interests as part of the securitization transactions, which consist of interest only strips receivable and cash on deposit. We also retained servicing responsibilities for the securitization trusts and receive annual servicing fees. Our services primarily consist of the management, service and administration of the loans, collection and posting of payments, and maintenance of accounts for the benefit of, and making distributions to, the holders of the asset backed securities. We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization trusts as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the securitization trusts economic performance in our role as servicer and hold a variable interest for which we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the securitization trusts. The securitization trusts were not subject to consolidation under the accounting guidance in effect prior to October 1, 2010.Our evaluation of whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of VIEs is highly complex and involves significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. The key estimates and assumptions used in our analyses may include the amount of AUM, investment management and related service fee rates, the life of the investment product, and the discount rate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. For example, AUM is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, contributions, withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily. In addition, third party purchases and redemptions, which are outside of our control, can impact our evaluation. Collateralized assets of CLOs and securitization trusts are impacted by market volatility and prepayment rates. There is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.While we believe that our evaluation is appropriate, future changes in estimates, judgments, and assumptions may affect the determination of primary beneficiary status and the resulting consolidation of VIEs in our consolidated financial statements.Fair Value Measurements We use a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. The three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below. Our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of each quarter. 49Table of Contents Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as non binding quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data. Level 2 quoted prices are generally obtained from two independent third party brokers or dealers, including prices derived from model based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data. Quoted prices are validated through price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of third party vendors. Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Level 3 valuations are derived primarily from model based valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the market.We record the majority of our investments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Trading securities and securities available for sale are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We may also measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These fair value measurements generally result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write downs of individual assets. Fair values are estimated for disclosure purposes for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value.As of September 30, 2011, Level 3 assets represented 16.6% of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to consolidated sponsored investment products investments in equity and secured and unsecured debt securities of entities in emerging markets which are not traded in active markets. Level 3 liabilities, comprised of long term debt of consolidated VIEs, represented 9.3% of total liabilities measured at fair value at September 30, 2011. Transfers into and out of Level 3 during fiscal year 2011 were immaterial. The following is a description of the significant assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the fair value methodologies used, and the fair value hierarchy level. Investment Securities, Trading consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products held for trading purposes and securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products. Changes in the fair value of trading securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products, and they are classified as Level 1. The fair value of securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products is primarily determined using quoted market prices, or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. These securities are primarily classified as Level 1 or Level 2. If events occur after the close of the primary market for any security, the quoted market prices may be adjusted for the observable price movements within country specific market proxies. Consolidated sponsored investment products may also hold securities that are classified as Level 3 because their fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs. In these instances, we primarily employ a market based valuation method, which may use prices of recent transactions, various market multiples, book values and other relevant information for the investment or related or other comparable assets to determine the fair value of the investment. In developing this fair value, we may also give consideration to an income based valuation method, which considers anticipated future cash flows of the investment and converts those amounts into a net present value. A discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the asset. Investment Securities, Available for Sale consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products and debt securities including securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, securities of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, and other equity securities. Realized gains and losses are included in investment income using either the average cost method or specific identification method. 50Table of ContentsUnrealized gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. The fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products and they are classified as Level 1. The fair value of debt securities is determined using quoted market prices, if available, or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes, which are evaluated for reasonableness, and they are generally classified as Level 2, except for certain U.S. Treasury securities which are classified as Level 1. The fair value of other equity securities, which consist primarily of non sponsored investment products, is generally determined based on the published net asset values of the investment products and they are classified as Level 1. We may also hold other equity securities that are classified as Level 3 because their fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs. In these instances we primarily employ the market based valuation method described above for Level 3 securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products. Investment securities, available for sale are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value. For available for sale equity securities, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer. When an impairment of an available for sale equity security is determined to be other than temporary, the impairment is recognized in earnings. For available for sale debt securities, if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings. If we do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of its amortized cost, the impairment is separated into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The credit loss component is the difference between the securitys amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and the losses related to all other factors are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary impairment in our portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Investments of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products consist primarily of direct investments in equity and secured and unsecured debt securities of entities in emerging markets, which are generally not traded in active markets. The fair value of these investments is generally determined using significant unobservable inputs and they are classified as Level 3. In these instances, we employ a market based method, using purchase multiples observed for comparable third party transactions, projected operating results of the investment, valuations of comparable companies, and subsequent financing transactions entered into by the investee entities. If the market based method is not available, we utilize an income based method, which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the investment. A discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investment.Investments and Long term Debt of Consolidated VIEs consist of the assets and liabilities of consolidated CLOs. These CLOs are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of assets, primarily corporate loans and, to a lesser extent, high yield bonds. We elected the fair value option for all assets and liabilities of the consolidated CLOs. The fair values of investments and debt held by the consolidated CLOs are primarily obtained from independent third party broker or dealer price quotes and they are classified as Level 2. The CLOs also hold securities and have issued debt that are classified as Level 3 because their fair values are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In these instances, we primarily employ a market based valuation method, which uses prices of recent transactions, various market multiples, book values and other relevant information for the instrument or related or other comparable instruments to determine the fair value. If the market based valuation method is not available, we utilize an income based valuation method, which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the instrument. A discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the instrument.While we believe the valuation methodologies described above are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. 51Table of ContentsIntangible assets consist primarily of mutual fund management contracts and customer base assets resulting from business acquisitions. We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to 15 years, using the straight line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. Indefinite lived intangible assets primarily represent contracts to manage mutual fund assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period. We make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our goodwill impairment test involves a two step process. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units, and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. We have two reporting units, investment management and related services and banking/finance, which are the same as our operating segments. All goodwill has been assigned to the investment management and related services reporting unit. Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible assets, we use valuation techniques based on an income approach under which future cash flows are discounted. Our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about revenue and AUM growth rates, the pre tax profit margin, the average effective fee rate, the effective tax rate, and the discount rate, which is based on our weighted average cost of capital. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate and the discount rate. We performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of August 1, 2011. We did not recognize any impairment because our estimates of the fair values of our reporting unit and our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The fair value of the investment management and related services reporting unit and over 90% of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 100%. The assumptions used in our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were developed taking into account the ongoing volatility in the capital and credit markets. As a result, the growth rate assumptions used as of August 1, 2011 were lower than the historical compounded growth rates. We estimated the discounted future cash flows using a 6.0% compounded annual AUM growth rate for goodwill and over 90% of our indefinite lived intangible assets, and a discount rate of 12.4%. We subsequently monitor the market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. We consider, among other things, changes in our AUM and weighted average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment tests as of August 1, 2011. We also monitor fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. Subsequent to August 1, 2011, there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as we determined no events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. We test definite lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value 52Table of Contentsof the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In evaluating the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from these assets. Our future undiscounted cash flow projections include assumptions about revenue and AUM growth rates, effective fee rates, investor redemptions, the pre tax profit margin, and expected useful lives. The most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the change in the amount of AUM. The assumptions used in our impairment tests are developed taking into consideration the ongoing market conditions. If the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, we measure the impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the asset is determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type. As of September 30, 2011, $37.3 million, or 71% of our definite lived intangible assets related to investment management contracts of Fiduciary Trust Company International (FTCI). The undiscounted future cash flow projections for FTCI institutional and high net worth management contracts exceeded their carrying values by 15% and 24%, respectively. The remaining balance primarily consists of assets acquired in July 2011 in connection with our acquisition of BEM. No events occurred or circumstances changed since the acquisition date that would indicate that these assets might be impaired.We estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for the FTCI definite lived intangible assets using AUM growth rates ranging from 0% to 5.0%. The assumptions used in the impairment tests for definite lived intangible assets were developed taking into consideration ongoing market conditions. As of September 30, 2011, a decline in AUM of approximately 13% could cause us to evaluate whether the fair value of the FTCI definite lived intangible assets is below the carrying value. While we believe that our impairment tests and the assumptions used to estimate fair value are reasonable and appropriate, if the assumptions used in our estimates of fair value change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise accelerate amortization expense. Revenues We recognize investment management fees, shareholder servicing fees and distribution fees as earned over the period in which services are rendered, except for performance based investment management fees, which are recognized when earned. We recognize sales commissions related to the sale of shares of our sponsored investment products on the trade date. Investment management fees are generally determined based on a percentage of AUM, except for performance based investment management fees, which are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts. Generally, shareholder servicing fees are calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced, while distribution fees are generally based on a percentage of AUM. AUM is calculated for our sponsored investment products using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. The fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies which incorporate unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type. The pricing of the securities held by our sponsored investment products is governed by a global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events. As of September 30, 2011, our total AUM by fair value hierarchy level was 30.4% Level 1, 68.3% Level 2 and 1.3% Level 3.As substantially all of our AUM is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our AUM. While recent economic conditions have increased market price volatility, the fair value of substantially all of the securities held by sponsored investment products continues to be derived from observable market inputs. Income Taxes We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities 53Table of Contentsand the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses. As a multi national corporation, we operate in various locations outside the U.S. and generate earnings from our non U.S. subsidiaries. We indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries, except for income previously taxed in the U.S., subject to regulatory or legal repatriation restrictions or requirements, and the excess net earnings reduced by cash needs for operational and regulatory capital requirements, capital management plans and capital expenditure plans of our Canadian and U.K. consolidated subsidiaries. As a result, we have not recognized a provision for U.S. income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on $4.9 billion of cumulative undistributed non U.S. earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at September 30, 2011. Changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non U.S. earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2011 to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount.

Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk, including, but not limited to, potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation. Financial instruments include, but are not limited to, investment securities, loans, deposits and debt obligations. Management is responsible for managing market risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess, and manage market and other risks. We are also exposed to market risk through our investment management and distribution fees, which are generally calculated as a percentage of the market value of AUM. Changes in equity market prices, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or a combination of these factors could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment management and distribution fees.We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily through our loans, investment in debt securities, and outstanding debt. We minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities, and through diversification. We minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates. In addition, our banking/finance segment monitors the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure arising from the loans receivable portfolio. As of September 30, 2011, we have considered the potential impact of a 200 basis point movement in market interest rates on our interest earning assets, net of interest bearing liabilities, total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities. Based on our analysis, we do not expect that such a change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in the next twelve months, for each of these categories or in the aggregate. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations. While we operate primarily in the U.S., we also provide services and earn revenues in The Bahamas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Australia, the Middle East and Africa. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized in relation to our results of operations since a significant portion of these revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the U.S. and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in relation to our consolidated balance sheet mostly relates to cash and cash equivalents and investments that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Euro, Indian Rupee, Pound Sterling, and Canadian Dollar. These assets accounted for approximately 11% of the total cash and cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2011. We also have exposure to foreign exchange revaluation of U.S. dollar balances held by certain non U.S. subsidiaries for which their local currency is the functional currency. These assets accounted for approximately 4% of the total cash and cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2011. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risk exposure. As a result, both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income. We are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value and securities held by sponsored investment products that we consolidate, which are also carried at fair value. To mitigate the risks we maintain a diversified investment portfolio and, from time to time, we may enter into derivative agreements. Our exposure to these risks is also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions, which allows us to mitigate the impact of changes in any particular market(s) or region(s). 57Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of the effect of a 10% increase or decrease in the carrying values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at September 30, 2011.(in thousands) Carrying Value CarryingValueAssuming a10% Increase CarryingValueAssuming a10% DecreaseAssets Current Assets Investment securities, trading $889,686 $978,655 $800,717Investment securities, available for sale 990,976 1,090,074 891,878Investments of consolidated VIEs, at fair value 10,994 12,093 9,895Total current assets $1,891,656 $2,080,822 $1,702,490Banking/Finance Assets Investment securities, available for sale $345,486 $380,035 $310,937Non Current Assets Investments of consolidated sponsored investment products $584,608 $643,069 $526,147Investments of consolidated VIEs, at fair value 811,618 892,780 730,456Total Assets $3,633,368 $3,996,706 $3,270,030Liabilities Current Liabilities Current maturities of long term debt of consolidated VIEs, at fair value $24,858 $27,344 $22,372Non Current Liabilities Long term debt of consolidated VIEs, at fair value $846,369 $931,006 $761,732Total Liabilities $871,227 $958,350 $784,104Our cash, cash equivalents and investments portfolio by investment objective at September 30, 2011 was as follows:(dollar amounts in thousands) Total Portfolio Percent of Total Portfolio Trading Securities Included in Portfolio Percent of Total Trading SecuritiesCash and Cash Equivalents $5,198,613 55%$ 0%Investment Securities Equity Global/international 474,699 5% 164,470 18%United States 28,873 0% 323 0%Total equity 503,572 5% 164,793 18%Hybrid 101,005 1% 0%Fixed Income Tax free 148,780 2% 0%Taxable Global/international 1,120,899 12% 290,435 33%United States 1,759,112 19% 434,458 49%Total fixed income 3,028,791 33% 724,893 82%Total Investment Securities 3,633,368 39% 889,686 100%Other Investments 557,370 6% 0%Total Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments $9,389,351 100% $889,686 100% 58Table of ContentsInvestments categorized as investment securities, trading in our consolidated balance sheets include securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products.
