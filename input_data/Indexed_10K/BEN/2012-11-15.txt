Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Statements In this section, we discuss and analyze the results of operations and financial condition of Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company). In addition to historical information, we also make statements relating to the future, called forward looking statements, which are provided under the safe harbor protection of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are generally written in the future tense and or are preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, seek, estimate, or other similar words. Moreover, statements that speculate about future events are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. You should carefully review the Risk Factors section set forth in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in any more recent filings 33Table of Contentswith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), each of which describe these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail. While forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. If a circumstance occurs after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, we do not have an obligation, and we undertake no obligation, to announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revisions to our forward looking statements, unless required by law. Overview We are a global investment management organization and derive our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide through products that include investment funds and institutional, high net worth and separately managed accounts (collectively, our sponsored investment products or SIPs). In addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales, distribution, shareholder services, transfer agency, trustee, custodial and other fiduciary services, as well as select private banking services. Our sponsored investment products and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to the public globally under seven distinct brand names: Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series, Bissett, Fiduciary Trust, Darby and Balanced Equity Management. We offer a broad range of SIPs under equity, hybrid, fixed income and cash management funds and accounts, including alternative investment products, that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors. We also manage certain sub advised investment products which may be sold to the public under one of our brand names or those of other companies or on a co branded basis.Effective July 1, 2012, we have one operating segment, investment management and related services. Previously, we had a secondary operating segment, banking/finance, which offered select retail banking, private banking and consumer lending services. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 (fiscal year 2012), we significantly reduced these services and now only offer select private banking services to investment management clients. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management (AUM). As noted in the Risk Factors section set forth above in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income. The level of our revenues also depends on mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. The fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our SIPs or our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. During fiscal year 2012, global financial markets produced strong positive returns, evidenced by a 22% increase in the MSCI World Index, a 30% increase in the S&P 500 Index, and a 5% increase in the Barclays Global Aggregate Index. The markets recovered from the significant volatility and negative sentiment experienced during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 (fiscal year 2011), but remained volatile throughout the year amid continued investor concerns related to the European sovereign debt crisis and the global economy. In this environment our simple monthly average AUM (average AUM) and earnings per share increased slightly from fiscal year 2011.Our total AUM at September 30, 2012 was $749.9 billion, 14% higher than at September 30, 2011. The increase was almost entirely due to $96.4 billion in market appreciation as the strong market returns resulted in valuation increases in all investment objectives. The increase in average AUM was lower, at 2%, due to market volatility and depreciation experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. Long term sales decreased 23% to $170.8 billion for fiscal year 2012, primarily due to reduced demand for global/international fixed income and equity products. Redemption activity decreased 7% to $172.7 billion, as global/international equity and tax free fixed income product redemptions declined, but were partially offset by an increase in redemptions in global/international fixed income products. 34Table of ContentsThe business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. In the U.S., the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Reform Act) imposes additional restrictions and limitations on our business, and we expect that the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) will cause us to incur significant administrative and compliance costs. We are also subject to numerous regulations by U.S. and non U.S. regulators that add further complexity to our ongoing global compliance operations.Uncertainties regarding economic stabilization and improvement remain in the foreseeable future. As we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our SIPs and on providing high quality customer service to our clients. While we are focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop employees and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. We will continue to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker/dealer and client relationships. The success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section in Part I of this Annual Report.

Net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. increased $7.8 million as higher investment and other income, net more than offset the decrease in operating income.Operating income increased $701.1 million and net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. increased $477.9 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a 27% increase in investment management fee revenues, which was driven by a 22% increase in average AUM and a higher effective management fee rate. Diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year 2012 despite the minimal increase in net income due to a 3% decrease in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from the repurchase of shares of our common stock. Diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year 2011 consistent with the increase in net income and a 2% decrease in diluted average common shares outstanding. 35Table of ContentsAssets Under Management AUM by investment objective was as follows: (dollar amounts in billions) 2012vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010as of September 30, 2012 2011 2010 Equity Global/international $214.9 $185.8 $204.2 16 % (9)%United States 82.2 68.4 69.5 20 % (2)%Total equity 297.1 254.2 273.7 17 % (7)%Hybrid 110.1 101.3 110.8 9 % (9)%Fixed Income Tax free 83.2 72.0 77.7 16 % (7)%Taxable Global/international 196.4 178.8 130.7 10 % 37 %United States 56.7 46.9 45.4 21 % 3 %Total fixed income 336.3 297.7 253.8 13 % 17 %Cash Management 6.4 6.7 6.6 (4)% 2 %Total $749.9 $659.9 $644.9 14 % 2 %Average for the Year $705.7 $694.4 $571.1 2 % 22 %AUM at September 30, 2012 increased 14% from September 30, 2011, almost entirely due to $96.4 billion in market appreciation as strong positive returns in global markets resulted in valuation increases in all investment objectives. AUM increased 2% during fiscal year 2011, driven by $36.4 billion of net new flows and $12.5 billion from acquisitions, largely offset by $30.5 billion in market depreciation as volatile market conditions led to valuation decreases. Average AUM, which is generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management and fund administration services than the year over year change in ending AUM, increased by 2% and 22% during fiscal years 2012 and 2011. 36Table of ContentsThe average mix of AUM by investment objective is shown below. The change in mix towards fixed income products during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 reflects investor preference for globally diversified fixed income investments.

Strong positive returns in global markets, evidenced by increases in the MSCI World, S&P 500 and Barclays Global Aggregate indexes of 22%, 30% and 5%, resulted in market appreciation across all investment objectives. Long term sales decreased 23% to $170.8 billion, primarily due to reduced demand for global/international fixed income and equity products as a result of ongoing investor concerns related to the European sovereign debt crisis and the strength of the global economic recovery. Long term redemptions decreased 7% to $172.7 billion, as global/international equity and tax free fixed income product redemptions declined, but were partially offset by an increase in redemptions in global/international fixed income products. Redemptions included $11.1 billion from an institutional advisory account in the hybrid objective.AUM increased $15.0 billion or 2% during fiscal year 2011, driven by $36.4 billion of net new flows and $12.5 billion from acquisitions, largely offset by $30.5 billion in market depreciation. Net new flows decreased 48% from the prior year, despite a 17% increase in long term sales led by growth in global/international fixed income products, as long term redemptions increased 50%, with increases in all investment objectives as a result of persistent market volatility amid investor concerns about economic growth, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and default risk associated with municipal bonds. The negative sentiment in the global financial markets, evidenced by a decrease in the MSCI World Index of 4%, also resulted in significant market depreciation in global/international equity and fixed income products. Redemptions included $12.0 billion from an institutional advisory account in the hybrid objective and losses of a few global equity institutional accounts.The average mix of AUM by sales region is shown below.

Due to the global nature of our business operations, investment management and related services may be performed in locations unrelated to the sales region.Investment Performance OverviewA key driver of our overall success is the long term investment performance of our SIPs. A standard measure of the performance of these investment products is the percentage of AUM exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians. The long term investment performance of our fixed income products has been strong with AUM frequently outperforming the benchmarks and peer group medians for the three , five and ten year periods ended September 30, 2012. Our global/international fixed income funds generated exceptional results with at least 87% of AUM exceeding the benchmarks and peer group medians for all periods presented, as did our hybrid products with at least 94% of AUM exceeding the peer group median for all periods. In addition, at least 95% of AUM of our tax free fixed income products exceeded the peer group medians for the five and ten year periods. The long term performance of our equity products has also been solid with AUM regularly exceeding the peer group medians for the three , five and ten year periods.39Table of ContentsThe performance of our products against benchmarks and peer group medians is presented in the table below.

The benchmark comparisons are based on each funds return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the investment objectives of the fund. The peer group rankings are sourced from Lipper, Morningstar or eVestment in each funds market and were based on an absolute ranking of returns as of September 30, 2012. For products with multiple share classes, rankings for the primary share class are applied to the entire product. Private equity, certain privately offered emerging market and real estate funds and cash management are not included. Certain other funds and products were also excluded because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had this data been available, the results may have been different. These results assume the reinvestment of dividends, are based on data available as of October 16, 2012 and are subject to revision. While we remain focused on achieving strong long term performance, our future benchmark and peer group rankings may vary from our past performance. Operating Revenues The table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category and the percentage of total operating revenues represented by each category. for the fiscal years ended September 30, Percentage Change Percentage of Total Operating Revenues 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 2012 2011 2010Investment management fees (2)% 27 % 63% 63% 61%Sales and distribution fees 0 % 16 % 32% 32% 33%Shareholder servicing fees 1 % 6 % 4% 4% 5%Other, net 82 % (7)% 1% 1% 1%Total Operating Revenues (1)% 22 % 100% 100% 100%Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our SIPs and the sub advised products that we manage as a percentage of the market value of AUM. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. Rates for products sold outside of the U.S. are generally higher than for U.S. products because they are structured to compensate for certain distribution costs.40Table of ContentsInvestment management fees decreased $72.7 million in fiscal year 2012. The decrease in fees was primarily due to a lower effective fee rate as described below, partially offset by a 2% increase in average AUM which originated from non U.S. products, primarily in the global/international fixed income objective.Investment management fees increased $956.8 million in fiscal year 2011. Approximately 87% of the increase was due to a 22% increase in average AUM, which was driven by net new flows from global/international fixed income products and acquisitions, as well as higher valuation levels resulting from market appreciation across most investment objectives during the first nine months of the fiscal year. The increase in fees was also impacted to a lesser extent by higher effective fee rates.Our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by average AUM) was 63.2 basis points for fiscal year 2012, as compared to 65.3 basis points for fiscal year 2011 and 62.6 basis points for fiscal year 2010. The rate decrease in fiscal year 2012 primarily resulted from lower levels and weighting of global/international equity AUM, which generally carry the highest fee rates, and lower performance based fees, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. hybrid rate due to the loss of an $11.1 billion institutional advisory account that had a low fee rate. The rate increase in fiscal year 2011 primarily resulted from higher levels and relative weighting of international AUM, which were driven by growth in cross border products. Performance based investment management fees were $13.6 million, $63.9 million, and $30.0 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010. U.S. industry asset weighted average management fee rates were as follows1.

As defined by Lipper Inc., management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity products are not included. Our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the U.S. industry average rates as we actively manage our products and have a higher level of international AUM, both of which generate higher fees. Changes to our effective investment management fee rates in the U.S. have not varied significantly from changes in industry rates. During fiscal years 2012 and 2011, our U.S. hybrid rate increased by approximately five basis points more than the industry rate due to losses of institutional advisory accounts of $11.1 billion and $12.0 billion that had low fee rates.Our product offerings and global operations are diverse. As such, the impact of future changes in the market value of AUM on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of investment objective, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets.41Table of ContentsSales and Distribution Fees We earn fees from the sale of certain classes of SIPs on which investors pay a commission at the time of purchase (commissionable sales). Sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor. Therefore, sales fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors. Globally, our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. Specifically, the majority of U.S. registered mutual funds, with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds, have adopted distribution plans under Rule 12b 1 (the Rule 12b 1 Plans) promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Rule 12b 1 Plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares, such as expenses for marketing, advertising, printing and sales promotion, subject to the Rule 12b 1 Plans limitations on amounts. The individual Rule 12b 1 Plans set a percentage limit for Rule 12b 1 expenses based on average daily net AUM of the mutual fund. Similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non U.S. funds where, generally, the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions. We pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our SIPs to the public on our behalf. See the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below. Sales and distribution fees by revenue driver are presented below:(dollar amounts in millions) Percentage Changefor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010Asset based fees $1,522.8 $1,511.5 $1,209.1 1 % 25%Sales based fees 725.7 737.0 724.8 (2)% 2%Contingent sales charges 10.8 15.0 13.2 (28)% 14%Sales and Distribution Fees $2,259.3 $2,263.5 $1,947.1 0 % 16%Asset based distribution fees increased $11.3 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to a 2% increase in average AUM and a higher mix of international AUM, partially offset by a higher mix of fixed income AUM. Asset based distribution fees increased $302.4 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a 22% increase in average AUM and a higher mix of international AUM. Equity products typically generate higher distribution fees than fixed income products, and international products typically generate higher distribution fees than U.S. products. Distribution fees as a percentage of average AUM were 0.22% for fiscal years 2012 and 2011, and 0.21% for fiscal year 2010.Sales based fees decreased $11.3 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to an 8% decrease in total commissionable sales and a higher mix of commissionable fixed income product sales, substantially offset by a higher mix of U.S. product sales. Sales fees increased $12.2 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a higher mix of commissionable equity product sales. Total commissionable sales increased 3% in fiscal year 2011, however the increase had no impact on sales fees due to a higher mix of international products. Equity products typically generate higher sales fees than fixed income products, and U.S. products typically generate higher sales fees than international products. Sales fees as a percentage of commissionable sales were 3.4%, 3.1% and 3.2% for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010. Commissionable sales represented 13%, 11% and 12% of total sales for fiscal years 2012 , 2011 and 2010.Contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a certain contracted period of time. These charges are levied only on certain shares sold without a front end sales charge, and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares.Shareholder Servicing Fees We receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service, and tax reporting. These fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. In some 42Table of Contentsinstances, we charge SIPs these fees based on the level of AUM. In the U.S., transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year. In Canada, such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. Accordingly, the level of fees will vary with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. Approximately 4.3 million accounts closed in the U.S. during calendar year 2011 were no longer billable effective July 1, 2012, as compared to approximately 2.2 million accounts closed during calendar year 2010 that were no longer billable effective July 1, 2011. Approximately 0.2 million accounts closed in Canada during calendar year 2011 were no longer billable effective May 1, 2012, compared to approximately 0.3 million accounts closed during calendar year 2010 that were no longer billable effective May 1, 2011. Other services include tax planning and return preparation for individual and trust clients, for which fees are primarily account based, and trustee services, for which fees are based on the level of AUM.Shareholder servicing fees increased $1.7 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in other service fees, mainly resulting from higher tax planning and return preparation fee rates and levels of trust AUM. Transfer agency service fees decreased $1.8 million primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts from the stronger U.S. dollar in all regions and an 8% decrease in billable shareholder accounts in Canada, partially offset by increases in Europe from a change in fee structures that became effective on January 1, 2011 and a 2% increase in billable shareholder accounts. Shareholder servicing fees increased $16.9 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to an $11.8 million increase in Europe resulting from the change in fee structures, a 15% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts and a 3% increase in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Shareholder servicing fees increased $2.3 million in the U.S. mainly due to a 9% increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts, partially offset by the impact of account conversions to omnibus accounts that earn lower fees.Other, Net Other, net revenue primarily consists of dividend and interest income from consolidated SIPs. It also includes interest income and expense and provisions for loan losses from lending activities.Other, net revenue increased $36.2 million in fiscal year 2012, primarily due to a $51.4 million increase in income from consolidated SIPs, including $30.4 million related to limited partnerships and similar structures that were consolidated as of September 30, 2011 or during fiscal year 2012. The increase was partially offset by a $13.1 million decrease in net revenue from banking/finance services due to a significant reduction in these services during the year. We no longer offer retail banking or consumer lending services, but continue to provide private banking services to investment management clients.Other, net revenue decreased $3.1 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to an $11.5 million decrease in net revenue from banking/finance services resulting from reduced activities, partially offset by a $6.7 million increase in income from consolidated SIPs. 43Table of ContentsOperating Expenses The table below presents the percentage change in each operating expense category and the percentage of total operating expenses represented by each category.for the fiscal years ended September 30, Percentage Change Percentage of Total Operating Expenses 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 2012 2011 2010Sales, distribution and marketing 1 % 19 % 60% 61% 59%Compensation and benefits 2 % 14 % 27% 27% 28%Information systems and technology 6 % 5 % 4% 4% 4%Occupancy (1)% 1 % 3% 3% 3%General, administrative and other 20 % (1)% 6% 5% 6%Total Operating Expenses 2 % 15 % 100% 100% 100%Sales, Distribution and Marketing Sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily consist of payments to financial advisers, broker/dealers and other third parties for providing services to investors in our SIPs, including marketing support services. Sales expenses are determined as percentages of sales and are incurred from the same commissionable sales transactions that generate sales fee revenues. Distribution expenses are determined as percentages of AUM and are incurred from assets that generate either distribution fees or higher levels of investment management fees. Marketing support expenses are based on sales, AUM or a combination thereof. Also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to up front commissions on shares sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders. The deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from distribution fee revenues and contingent sales charges received from shareholders of the funds upon redemption of their shares. Sales, distribution and marketing expenses by cost driver are presented below:(dollar amounts in millions) Percentage Changefor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010Asset based expenses $1,946.9 $1,881.8 $1,418.2 3 % 33 %Sales based expenses 662.9 675.8 676.0 (2)% 0 %Amortization of deferred sales commissions 129.9 155.2 188.7 (16)% (18)%Sales, Distribution and Marketing $2,739.7 $2,712.8 $2,282.9 1 % 19 %Asset based expenses increased $65.1 million in fiscal year 2012 due to a $35.2 million increase in distribution expenses on non U.S. products primarily resulting from a 3% increase in the related average international AUM, a $25.2 million increase in distribution expenses on U.S. products resulting from a 2% increase in the related average U.S. AUM and a higher mix of Class C assets, which have higher expense rates than other U.S. product classes, and a $4.7 million increase in marketing support expenses resulting from a higher mix of the expenses that are based on AUM. Asset based expenses increased $463.6 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a $331.7 million increase in distribution expenses on non U.S. products resulting from a 41% increase in average international AUM, and a $117.0 million increase in distribution expenses on U.S. products resulting from a 14% increase in average U.S. AUM. Asset based expenses as a percentage of average AUM were 0.28%, 0.27% and 0.25% for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010. Distribution expenses, which are typically higher for non U.S. products, are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to international fee structures which provide for recovery of certain distribution costs through investment management fees.44Table of ContentsSales based expenses decreased $12.9 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to an 8% decrease in total commissionable sales, substantially offset by a higher mix of U.S. product sales, which typically generate higher commissions than non U.S. products. Sales based marketing support expenses contributed $4.3 million to the decrease due to a lower mix of the expenses that are based on sales. Sales based expenses decreased $0.2 million in fiscal year 2011, as total commissionable sales increased 3%, but higher non U.S. product sales were substantially offset by lower U.S. product sales and resulted in essentially flat sales commission expenses. Sales based expenses as a percentage of sales based fees were 91%, 92% and 93% for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010.Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $25.3 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to a $17.3 million decrease related to lower sales of U.S. Class A and C shares sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders, and a $5.7 million decrease related to U.S. Class B shares which were fully amortized in the prior year. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $33.5 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to the full amortization of the U.S. Class B shares. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefit expenses increased $24.3 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefits, partially offset by decreases in commission and variable compensation. Salaries, wages and benefits increased $38.4 million, primarily due to a $25.1 million increase in salaries and wages resulting from higher staffing levels and annual merit salary adjustments that were effective December 1, 2011 and a $9.5 million increase in severance benefits related to various employee terminations. Commissions decreased $11.5 million, reflecting the 23% decrease in long term sales. Variable compensation decreased $1.8 million, as an $8.8 million decrease related to private equity performance fees was substantially offset by higher bonus expense based on our performance. Compensation and benefit expenses as a percentage of operating revenues were 18%, 17% and 18% for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010. At September 30, 2012, our global workforce had increased to approximately 8,600 employees from approximately 8,500 employees at September 30, 2011.Compensation and benefit expenses increased $150.2 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to increases in variable compensation and salaries, wages and benefits. Variable compensation increased $79.0 million, mainly due to higher bonus expense based on our performance and a $7.0 million increase related to private equity performance fees. Salaries, wages and benefits increased $74.6 million, primarily due to a $49.7 million increase in salaries and wages resulting from higher staffing levels, annual merit salary adjustments and unfavorable currency impacts, as well as an increase of $16.5 million in 401(k) plan matching contributions. We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our SIPs or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefit expenses going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue. Information Systems and Technology Information systems and technology costs increased $9.8 million and $7.5 million in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 primarily due to higher investments in strategic technology projects for operational purposes.Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs are shown below. (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010Net carrying value at beginning of year $67.9 $63.9 $65.2Additions, net of disposals 54.9 40.4 34.0Amortization (32.5) (36.4) (35.3)Net Carrying Value at End of Year $90.3 $67.9 $63.945Table of ContentsOccupancy We conduct our worldwide operations using a combination of leased and owned facilities. Occupancy costs include rent and other facilities related costs including depreciation and utilities.Occupancy costs decreased $1.1 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to lower building repairs and maintenance costs. Occupancy costs increased $1.0 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to facility improvement costs. General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other operating expenses primarily consist of fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties, advertising and promotion costs, corporate travel and entertainment, professional fees, and other miscellaneous expenses. General, administrative and other operating expenses increased $45.7 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to $38.5 million of net insurance recoveries during fiscal year 2011 for losses incurred in previous years, $12.9 million in current year expenses of limited partnerships and similar structures that were consolidated as of September 30, 2011 and an $8.8 million increase in professional fees mainly related to acquisition activities and changes to our banking/finance business. The increases were partially offset by a $13.6 million decrease in consulting fees related to private equity performance fees.General, administrative and other operating expenses decreased $2.7 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to $38.5 million of net insurance recoveries for losses incurred in prior years, which were substantially offset by various expense increases. Fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties increased $10.6 million due to higher average AUM and consulting fees related to private equity performance fees increased $10.2 million. In addition, advertising and sales and promotion expenses increased $10.1 million and corporate travel expenses increased $5.8 million due to higher levels of business activity. We are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities. As a result of potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues.Other Income (Expenses) (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010Investment and other income, net $199.7 $1.8 $127.6Interest expense (36.7) (37.4) (16.5)Other income (expenses), net $163.0 $(35.6) $111.1Other income (expenses) consists of net investment and other income and interest expense, excluding interest income and expense from banking/finance activities. Net investment and other income consists primarily of gains (losses) on trading investment securities, investments of consolidated SIPs and assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs); realized gains (losses) on sale of available for sale investment securities; income (losses) from equity method investees; dividend and interest income; other than temporary impairments and foreign currency exchange gains (losses). Other income (expenses) increased $198.6 million in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to market valuation gains. Higher market valuations resulted in $25.6 million of net gains from the changes in fair value of the assets and liabilities of consolidated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) as compared to $80.0 million of net losses in the prior year. Recovery in the financial markets also resulted in a $69.7 million increase in income from equity method investees, a $36.0 million increase in net gains on trading investment securities, and a $20.2 million decrease in net losses from securities held by consolidated SIPs. These increases were partially offset by a $24.5 million decrease in realized gains on available for sale investment securities and a $13.2 million decrease in dividend income. 46Table of ContentsOther income (expenses) decreased $146.7 million in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to market valuation losses, partially offset by higher realized gains. Lower market valuations resulted in $80.0 million of net losses from the changes in fair value of the assets and liabilities of consolidated CLOs following implementation of new accounting guidance related to consolidation of VIEs, and in $36.1 million of net losses from securities held by consolidated SIPs as compared to $8.5 million of net gains in the prior year. Lower market valuations also resulted in a $31.6 million decrease in net gains on trading investment securities, a $21.0 million decrease in income from equity method investees, and a $12.1 million increase in other than temporary impairments on certain available for sale and other equity investments. In addition, interest expense increased by $20.9 million, primarily due to $900 million of long term debt issued in May 2010. These decreases were partially offset by a $47.6 million increase in realized gains on available for sale investment securities. Substantially all of the net gains (losses) of consolidated CLOs and limited partnerships and similar structures, and a significant noncontrolling percentage of the net gains (losses) from other consolidated SIPs are offset in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income. Our investments in SIPs include initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings, as well as investments for other business reasons. The market conditions that impact our AUM similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our SIPs investments.

Other investments include $424.1 million of investments in equity method investees that hold securities which primarily have a global/international equity investment objective, are subject to market valuation risks and are readily marketable. 47Table of ContentsTaxes on Income As a multi national corporation, we often provide our services from locations outside the U.S. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the U.S. The mix of pre tax income subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the U.S., produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing U.S. federal and state income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2012 was 28.5% as compared to 30.6% in fiscal year 2011 and 29.9% in fiscal year 2010. The decrease in fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to changes in state tax legislation and lower net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The increase in fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the recognition of higher tax reserves in the prior year resulting from new legislation. The effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non U.S. earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable income. Changes in tax rates in these jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows were as follows: (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010Cash Flow Data Operating cash flows $1,066.2 $1,621.8 $1,651.0Investing cash flows 873.4 435.9 (32.7)Financing cash flows (1,084.9) (968.2) (594.9)Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2012, despite an increase in net income, primarily due to higher purchases of trading securities, net gains of consolidated VIEs compared to net losses in the prior year, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Net cash provided by investing activities increased mainly due to cash recognized due to consolidation of a VIE, proceeds from sale of loans, higher liquidations of investments, net of purchases, and prior year acquisitions, partially offset by lower collections of loans receivable by consolidated VIEs. Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to a decrease in deposits and higher dividends paid on common stock, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of senior notes and lower repurchases of common stock.Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2011, despite an increase in net income, due to higher purchases of trading securities, a decrease in income taxes payable and higher net gains on sales of assets, partially offset by net losses of consolidated VIEs. Investing cash inflows in fiscal year 2011, as compared to investing cash outflows in the prior fiscal year, were mainly due to higher liquidations of investments, net of purchases, and a decrease in loans receivable held by consolidated VIEs. Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to proceeds from issuance of debt in the prior fiscal year, repayment of debt by consolidated VIEs, and higher repurchases of common stock, substantially offset by lower dividends paid on common stock, an increase in deposits, and higher net subscriptions of noncontrolling interests.The assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs and consolidated SIPs attributable to third party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no right to these consolidated entities assets, other than our direct equity investment in them, and management fees earned from them. The debt holders of these consolidated entities have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no risks associated with the entities liabilities. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs and consolidated SIPs, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below.48Table of ContentsOur liquid assets and debt consisted of the following: (in millions) as of September 30, 2012 2011 2010Assets Cash and cash equivalents $5,784.3 $5,028.9 $4,119.7Receivables 823.8 745.9 671.8Investments 2,266.7 1,952.0 2,024.0Total liquid assets $8,874.8 $7,726.8 $6,815.5Liabilities Debt Commercial paper $ $30.0 $30.0Federal Home Loan Bank advances 69.0 69.0 51.0Senior notes 1,497.1 899.2 898.9Total debt $1,566.1 $998.2 $979.9Liquidity Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and certain investments. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions, money market funds, securities of U.S. government sponsored enterprises and the U.S. Treasury, and time deposits. Liquid investments consist of trading and available for sale securities, investments in equity method investees consisting of mutual fund SIPs, direct investments in redeemable consolidated SIPs, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months.Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2012 increased primarily due to net cash provided by operating and investing activities, partially offset by net cash used in financing activities. The percentages of cash and cash equivalents held by our U.S. and non U.S. operations were 46% and 54% at September 30, 2012, and 45% and 55% at September 30, 2011. We utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to fund operational and regulatory requirements and capital contributions relating to our SIPs. Certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of capital which are partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents. As a result, such subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. Also, as a multi national corporation, we operate in various locations outside of the U.S. Certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or requirements. Such restrictions and requirements limit our ability to transfer cash between various international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the U.S. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated domestically, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases, or we could elect to repatriate future earnings from non U.S. jurisdictions or raise capital through debt or equity issuance. Certain of these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense or other dilution to our earnings. At September 30, 2012 our U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $2,094.3 million and $1,988.8 million of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and capital contributions to our SIPs, as compared to approximately $2,140.4 million and $1,933.5 million held at September 30, 2011.Capital Resources We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities. In September 2012, we issued senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes with a total face value of $600.0 million. The notes consist of $300.0 million issued at a fixed interest rate of 1.375% per annum which mature in September 2017 and $300.0 million issued at a fixed rate of 2.800% per annum which mature in September 2022. Net proceeds 49Table of Contentsfrom the issuance of the notes were used in October 2012 to redeem our 2.000% senior notes due in May 2013 at a make whole redemption price of $305.4 million, and in November 2012 to finance the acquisition of a majority interest in K2 Advisors Holdings LLC for $182.9 million in cash; the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.In May 2010, we issued senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes with a total face value of $900.0 million. Of the notes, $300.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 2.000% per annum and matures in 2013, $250.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 3.125% per annum and matures in 2015, and $350.0 million was issued at a fixed interest rate of 4.625% per annum and matures in 2020. Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for general corporate purposes.Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. The notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make whole redemption price. The indentures governing the notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. The indentures also include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity. As of September 30, 2012, we were in compliance with the covenants of the notes. In prior years, we secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) to fund our banking services. At September 30, 2012, we had $69.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.30%. FHLB advances are subject to collateralization requirements. At September 30, 2012, we had $500.0 million of short term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since April 2012, $270.0 million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the Federal Reserve system, $117.8 million available through the secured Federal Reserve Bank short term discount window, $15.3 million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit and $12.3 million available in secured FHLB short term borrowing capacity. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. Uses of Capital We expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business, acquire shares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, invest in our SIPs, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt. We declare and pay dividends on a quarterly basis. We declared regular cash dividends of $1.08 per share ($0.27 per share per quarter) and a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share in fiscal year 2012, and regular cash dividends of $1.00 per share ($0.25 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2011. We currently expect to continue paying comparable regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors. We maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. During fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we repurchased 7.5 million and 8.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $797.4 million and $954.2 million. At September 30, 2012, approximately 7.2 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program, which is not subject to an expiration date. During fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we invested $365.0 million and $264.0 million, net of redemptions, in our SIPs.50Table of ContentsIn July 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Balanced Equity Management Pty. Limited, a specialty Australian equity manager, for $53.7 million in cash and 85,000 shares of Franklin common stock with an aggregate value of $11.4 million at the acquisition date, for a total purchase consideration of $65.1 million.In January 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Rensburg Fund Management Limited, a specialty U.K. equity manager, for $72.9 million in cash. In December 2010, we purchased an office building to be used in business operations in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $29.7 million in cash.The funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in kind redemptions, and lines of credit. While we have no contractual obligation to do so, we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments. We believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities.

Purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be canceled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees.3. Committed capital contributions primarily relate to discretionary commitments to invest in planned SIP launches. The debt holders of consolidated VIEs and consolidated SIPs have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investments, therefore we bear no risks associated with these entities liabilities. See Note 13 Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K.At September 30, 2012, our consolidated balance sheet includes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $101.3 million and related accrued interest of $14.6 million (see Note 14 Taxes on Income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K). The amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are de minimus. However, because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of September 30, 2012 cannot be made. Consequently, unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the table above. 51Table of ContentsOff Balance Sheet Arrangements In our role as agent or trustee, we facilitate the settlement of investor share purchase, redemption, and other transactions with affiliated mutual funds. We are appointed by the affiliated mutual funds as agent or trustee to manage, on their behalf, bank deposit accounts that contain only (i) cash remitted by investors to the affiliated mutual funds for the direct purchase of fund shares, or (ii) cash remitted by the affiliated mutual funds for direct delivery to the investors for either the proceeds of fund shares liquidated at the investors direction, or dividends and capital gains earned on fund shares. As of September 30, 2012 and 2011, we held cash of approximately $202.4 million and $124.5 million off balance sheet in agency or trust for investors and the affiliated mutual funds. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our results of operations and financial position. For additional information about our accounting policies, see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. Consolidation We consolidate our subsidiaries and SIPs in which we have a controlling financial interest. We are generally considered to have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in an entity. We also consolidate VIEs for which we are considered the primary beneficiary and non VIE limited partnerships and similar structures for which we are deemed to have control.A VIE is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. The assessment of whether an entity is a VIE or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure by structure basis. When performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entitys legal organization and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. A limited partnership or similar structure entity for which we are the general partner or managing member, our aggregate investment is not substantive and the limited partners or other investors do not have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member, liquidate the entity or otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity is a VIE. Otherwise the entity is a VOE and we are presumed to control the entity unless the limited partners or other investors have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member, liquidate the entity or otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity.We use two models for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of VIEs. For all investment entities with the exception of CLOs, we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the majority of the risks or rewards of ownership. For all other VIEs, including CLOs, we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.The variable interests that we have in investment entity VIEs consist of our equity ownership interest in and or investment management and related service fees earned from these VIEs. We use expected cash flow scenarios to determine if our investment management and related service fees and or equity ownership interests provide us with a majority of the VIEs expected losses or residual returns. Based on our evaluation, we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.We provide collateral management services to our sponsored CLOs, which are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of corporate debt securities, and are considered VIEs. We generally earn senior and subordinated management fees from the CLOs based on the par value of outstanding debt securities and, in certain instances, may also receive performance based fees. In addition, we hold equity interests in certain of these entities. We determined 52Table of Contentsthat we are the primary beneficiary of the CLOs as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the CLOs economic performance in our role as collateral manager and hold a variable interest for which we have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the CLOs.Our evaluation of whether we are the primary beneficiary of VIEs is highly complex and involves significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. The key estimates and assumptions used in our analyses may include the amount of AUM, investment management and related service fee rates, the life of the investment product, and the discount rate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. For example, AUM is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, contributions, withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily. In addition, third party purchases and redemptions, which are outside of our control, can impact our evaluation. Collateralized assets of CLOs are impacted by market volatility and prepayment rates. There is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.While we believe that our evaluation is appropriate, future changes in estimates, judgments, and assumptions may affect the determination of primary beneficiary status and the resulting consolidation of VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements We use a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. The three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below. Our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of each quarter. Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as non binding quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data. Level 2 quoted prices are generally obtained from two independent third party brokers or dealers, including prices derived from model based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data. Quoted prices are validated through price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of third party vendors. Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Level 3 valuations are derived primarily from model based valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the market.The fair values for Level 3 assets and liabilities are determined using various methodologies in accordance with our global pricing policy which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type. When available, we measure fair value based on the reported net asset value of underlying investments or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes. These inputs are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures which include due diligence reviews of the third parties, price comparisons across pricing vendors, stale price reviews and subsequent sales testing. If these inputs are not available, we primarily employ a market based method, using purchase multiples observed for comparable third party transactions, valuations of comparable entities, projected operating results of the investee entity or subsequent financing transactions entered into by the investee entity. If the inputs for a market based method are not available, we utilize an income based method, which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the investment. A discount may be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investment. We review and approve the market based and income based methods on a periodic basis for changes that would impact the unobservable inputs incorporated into the valuation process. The fair value measurements from these methods are further validated through price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing and market comparable sales.53Table of ContentsWe record the majority of our investments at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. We may also measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These fair value measurements generally result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write downs of individual assets. Fair values are estimated for disclosure purposes for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value.As of September 30, 2012, Level 3 assets represented 20% of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to investments of consolidated SIPs in equity and secured and unsecured debt securities of entities in emerging markets which are not traded in active markets. Level 3 liabilities, comprised of long term debt of consolidated VIEs, represented 6% of total liabilities measured at fair value at September 30, 2012. Transfers into and out of Level 3 during fiscal year 2012 were immaterial. Following are descriptions of the significant assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including the fair value methodologies used and hierarchy levels. Investment Securities, Trading consist of non consolidated SIPs. Changes in the fair value of trading securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair value of these securities is determined based on their published net asset values and they are classified as Level 1. Investment Securities, Available for Sale consist primarily of non consolidated SIPs, debt securities including securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, securities of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, and other equity securities. Realized gains and losses are included in investment income using either the average cost method or specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. The fair value of SIPs is determined based on their published net asset values and they are classified as Level 1. The fair value of debt securities is determined using quoted market prices, if available, or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes, which are evaluated for reasonableness, and they are generally classified as Level 2, except for certain U.S. Treasury securities which are classified as Level 1. The fair value of other equity securities, which consist primarily of non sponsored investment products, is generally determined based on their published net asset values, and they are classified as Level 1. Investment securities, available for sale are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value. For equity securities, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer. When an impairment of an equity security is determined to be other than temporary, the impairment is recognized in earnings. For debt securities, if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings. If we do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of its amortized cost, the impairment is separated into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The credit loss component is the difference between the securitys amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows, and is recognized in earnings. Losses related to all other factors are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. While we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary impairment in our investment portfolio, different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Investments of Consolidated SIPs consist of trading securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets. Changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair value of the trading securities is determined using quoted market prices, or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. These securities are primarily classified as Level 1 or Level 2. If events occur after the close of the primary market for any security, the quoted market prices may be adjusted for the observable price movements within country specific market proxies. 54Table of ContentsThe investments that are not generally traded in active markets primarily consist of equity and secured and unsecured debt securities of entities in emerging markets. The fair value of these securities is generally determined using significant unobservable inputs and they are classified as Level 3. In these instances, we employ a market based approach, using purchase multiples observed for comparable third party transactions, projected operating results of the investment, valuations of comparable companies, and subsequent financing transactions entered into by the investee entities. If the market based approach is not available, we utilize an income based approach, which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the investment. A discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investment. Investments that are not generally traded in active markets also include fund products for which the fair value is estimated using net asset value as a practical expedient and are classified as Level 3. Investments and Debt of Consolidated VIEs consist of corporate debt securities held and debt issued by CLOs. We elected the fair value option for all assets and liabilities of our consolidated CLOs. The fair values of the corporate debt securities and debt are primarily obtained from independent third party broker or dealer price quotes and they are classified as Level 2. The CLOs may also hold securities and have issued debt that are classified as Level 3 because the fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs. In these instances, we primarily employ the market based approach described above for Level 3 securities held by consolidated SIPs. While we believe the valuation methodologies described above are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets consist primarily of mutual fund management contracts and customer base assets resulting from business acquisitions. We amortize these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to 15 years, using the straight line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. Indefinite lived intangible assets primarily represent contracts to manage mutual fund assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period. We make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit below its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test involves a two step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In the second step, impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill. We have one reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with our single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned. PriorIndefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible assets, we use valuation techniques based on an income approach under which future cash flows are discounted. Our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about revenue and AUM growth rates, the pre tax profit margin, the average effective fee rate, the effective tax rate, and the discount rate, which is based on our weighted average cost of capital. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate and the discount rate. 55Table of ContentsWe performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of August 1, 2012. We did not recognize any impairment because our estimates of the fair values of our reporting unit and our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The fair value of the investment management and related services reporting unit and over 86% of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 100%. The assumptions used in our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were developed taking into account the ongoing volatility in the capital and credit markets. As a result, the growth rate assumptions used as of August 1, 2012 were lower than the historical compounded growth rates. We estimated the discounted future cash flows using a 6.0% compounded annual AUM growth rate for goodwill and over 86% of our indefinite lived intangible assets, and a discount rate of 12.7%. We subsequently monitor the market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. We consider, among other things, changes in our AUM and weighted average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment tests as of August 1, 2012. We also monitor fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. Subsequent to August 1, 2012, there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as we determined no events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. We test definite lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In evaluating the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from these assets. Our future undiscounted cash flow projections include assumptions about revenue and AUM growth rates, effective fee rates, investor redemptions, the pre tax profit margin, and expected useful lives. The most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the change in the amount of AUM. The assumptions used in our impairment tests are developed taking into consideration the ongoing market conditions. If the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the asset is determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type. As of September 30, 2012, the undiscounted future cash flow projections for $30.9 million, or 70%, of our definite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 35%. We estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for these assets using AUM growth rates ranging from 5% to 6%. The assumptions used in the impairment tests for definite lived intangible assets were developed taking into consideration current market conditions. As of September 30, 2012, a decline in AUM of approximately 27% could cause us to evaluate whether their fair value is below the carrying value. There was no impairment of definite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2012. While we believe that our impairment tests and the assumptions used to estimate fair value are reasonable and appropriate, if the assumptions used in our estimates of fair value change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise accelerate amortization expense. Revenues Investment management, shareholder servicing and distribution fees are recognized as earned over the period in which services are rendered, except for performance based investment management fees, which are recognized when earned. Sales commissions related to the sale of shares of SIPs are recognized on trade date. Investment management fees are generally determined based on a percentage of AUM, except for performance based investment management fees, which are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts. Shareholder servicing fees are generally calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced while distribution fees are generally based on a percentage of AUM. 56Table of ContentsAUM of SIPs is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. The fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies which incorporate unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type. The pricing of the securities held by SIPs is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events. As of September 30, 2012, our total AUM by fair value hierarchy level was 50.5% Level 1, 48.3% Level 2 and 1.2% Level 3.As substantially all of our AUM is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our AUM. While recent economic conditions have resulted in ongoing market price volatility, the fair value of substantially all of the securities held by SIPs continues to be derived from observable market inputs. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses. As a multi national corporation, we operate in various locations outside the U.S. and generate earnings from our non U.S. subsidiaries. We indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries, except for income previously taxed in the U.S., subject to regulatory or legal repatriation restrictions or requirements, and the excess net earnings reduced by cash needs for operational and regulatory capital requirements, capital management plans and capital expenditure plans of our Canadian and U.K. consolidated subsidiaries. As a result, we have not recognized a provision for U.S. income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on $5.6 billion of cumulative undistributed non U.S. earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at September 30, 2012. Changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non U.S. earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. In managements opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2012 to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount.

Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk, including, but not limited to, potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation. Financial instruments include, but are not limited to, investment securities, loans, deposits and debt obligations. Management is responsible for managing market risk. 58Table of ContentsOur Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess, and manage market and other risks. Our market risk from assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and consolidated SIPs is limited to that of our direct investments in, and management fees earned from, these entities. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs and consolidated SIPs are excluded from the discussion below.AUM Market Price RiskWe are exposed to market risk through our investment management and distribution fees, which are generally calculated as a percentage of the market value of AUM. Changes in equity market prices, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or a combination of these factors could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment management and distribution fees. Our exposure to these risks is minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions, which serves to mitigate the impact of changes in any particular market(s) or region(s). Interest Rate RiskWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily through our investments in debt securities, loans receivable, deposits and debt obligations. At September 30, 2012, we had exposure from $1,782.7 million of investments in debt securities and SIPs that invest in debt securities, $254.4 million of net loans receivable and $522.3 million of interest bearing deposits. We minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities, and through diversification, ensuring an appropriate mix of fixed rate and floating rate investments. Our exposure to the risks from investments in SIPs is also minimized by our broad range of products in various global jurisdictions, mitigating the impact of changes in any particular market(s) or region(s). We minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates. At September 30, 2012, all of our outstanding debt was issued at fixed rates. In addition, we monitor the interest rates and average maturities of our loan and deposit portfolios. As of September 30, 2012, we have considered the potential impact of a 100 basis point movement in market interest rates on our interest earning cash and cash equivalents, portfolio of debt securities, loans receivable, deposits and debt obligations. Based on our analysis, we do not expect that such a change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in the next twelve months, for any of these categories or in the aggregate. Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations. While we operate primarily in the U.S., we also provide services and earn revenues in The Bahamas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Canada, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized in relation to our results of operations since a significant portion of these revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the U.S. and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase. The exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in our consolidated balance sheet mostly relates to cash and cash equivalents and investments that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Euro, Indian Rupee, Pound Sterling, and Canadian Dollar. These assets accounted for approximately 10% of total cash and cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2012. We also have exposure to foreign exchange revaluation of U.S. dollar balances held by certain non U.S. subsidiaries for which their local currency is the functional currency. These assets accounted for approximately 6% of total cash and cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2012. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risk exposure. As a result, both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income.Market Valuation RiskWe are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value. To mitigate the risks we maintain a diversified investment portfolio and, from time to time, we may enter into derivative agreements. 59Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of the effect of a 10% increase or decrease in the carrying values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at September 30, 2012.(in millions) Carrying Value CarryingValueAssuming a10% Increase CarryingValueAssuming a10% DecreaseInvestment securities, trading $1,130.6 $1,243.7 $1,017.5Investment securities, available for sale 870.0 957.0 783.0Direct investments in consolidated VIEs and consolidated SIPs 405.5 446.1 365.0Total $2,406.1 $2,646.8 $2,165.560Table of Contents
