Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act) provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statement. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Act. This report, as well as other verbal or written statements or reports made by or on the behalf of the Company, may contain or may incorporate material by reference which includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Statements, other than those based on historical facts, which address activities, events, or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), business strategy, expansion and growth of the Companys business and operations, and other similar matters are forward looking statements, which are based upon a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Although the Company believes the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business, actual events and results may materially differ from anticipated results described in such statement. The Companys ability to achieve such results is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, any one, or a combination, of which could materially affect the results of the Companys operations. These factors include: sourcing and purchasing merchandise, the cost of the merchandise, economic and weather conditions which affect buying patterns of the Companys customers, changes in consumer spending and consumer debt levels, inflation, the Companys ability to anticipate buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies, continued availability of capital and financing, competitive pressures and pricing pressures, and other risks described from time to time in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consequently, all of the forward looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or that they will have the expected effects on the Company or its business or operations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements contained in this report, or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Business Operations The Company is the nations largest broadline closeout retailer. The Companys goal is to build upon its leadership position in closeout retailing, a growing segment of the retailing industry, by expanding its market presence in both existing and new markets. The Company believes that the combination of its strengths in merchandising, purchasing, site selection, distribution, and cost containment has made it a low cost value retailer well positioned for future growth. FORM 10 K Page 13 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At February 2, 2002, the Company operated a total of 1,335 stores operating as BIG LOTS, BIG LOTS FURNITURE, PIC N SAVE, and MAC FRUGALS BARGAINS CLOSEOUTS. Wholesale operations are conducted through BIG LOTS WHOLESALE, CONSOLIDATED INTERNATIONAL, WISCONSIN TOY, and with online shopping at biglotswholesale.com. The following table compares components of the statements of operations of the Company as a percentage of net sales. Results for 2001 include the impact of a $50.4 million (after tax) non cash charge described elsewhere herein. Fiscal Year 2001 2000 1999 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 39.1 42.3 43.1 Selling and administrative expenses 39.9 36.6 37.3 Operating profit (loss) (0.8 ) 5.7 5.8 Interest expense 0.6 0.7 0.6 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (1.4 ) 5.0 5.2 Income tax expense (benefit) (0.6 ) 2.0 2.0 Income (loss) from continuing operations (0.8 ) 3.0 3.2 Discontinued operations 0.2 (14.6 ) 0.1 Net income (loss) (0.6 )% (11.6 )% 3.3 % The Company has historically experienced, and expects to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations, with a significant percentage of its net sales and operating profit being realized in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, the Companys quarterly results can be affected by the timing of store openings and closings, the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores, and the timing of certain holidays. Name Change and Reincorporation On May 16, 2001, the Company announced that it had changed its name to Big Lots, Inc. and its ticker symbol to NYSE: BLI. The name change was approved at the Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 15, 2001. Also approved was a proposal to change the state of the Companys incorporation from Delaware to Ohio. This change was affected by merging Consolidated Stores Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Consolidated (Delaware)), with and into the Company (the Merger). At the effective time of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Consolidated (Delaware) ceased, and the Company succeeded to all business, properties, assets, and liabilities of Consolidated (Delaware). The shares of common stock of Consolidated (Delaware) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger were, by virtue of the Merger, converted into an equal number of shares of fully paid and non assessable common shares of the Company. In connection with this change, all stores under the names of Odd Lots, Mac Frugals, and Pic N Save are being converted to Big Lots over a two year period. Through February 2, 2002, 205 stores had been successfully converted to the Big Lots name. As of the end of fiscal 2001, 1,167 of the Companys 1,335 stores were under the Big Lots name. The Company expects that the remaining stores will be converted to the Big Lots name during 2002. In connection with this process, the Company has made certain improvements to the converted sites. The improvements made vary by location and include, among other things, painting, lighting retrofits, new signage (interior and exterior), new flooring, and updated restrooms. The Company believes that Big Lots is its most recognizable brand name and that this change offers numerous opportunities to increase brand awareness among FORM 10 K Page 14 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) customers, suppliers, investors, and the general public. The Company believes the change will also allow it to leverage future television advertising and other expenses. On August 22, 2001, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had unanimously voted to redeem the preferred stock rights issued under the Companys Rights Agreement, sometimes referred to as a poison pill. The redemption was a direct result of the Companys redomestication into Ohio, as approved by its shareholders at the Companys 2001 Annual Meeting. At the 2000 Annual Meeting, a non binding shareholder proposal passed seeking the termination of the Companys Rights Agreement. The Board believes that the statutory protections offered by the Companys new state of incorporation provide adequate safeguards to permit the Board and the Companys shareholders to fully and fairly evaluate any takeover offer, whether coercive or not. Accordingly, the Board found it to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to redeem the preferred stock rights issued under the Rights Agreement. Sale of Division On June 27, 2000, the Company announced its decision to separate the toy and closeout businesses by divesting the Companys KB Toy Division. The financial statements and notes have been reclassified for all applicable periods presented to reflect the toy segment as a discontinued operation. On December 7, 2000, the Company closed the sale of its KB Toy Division to an affiliate of Bain Capital, Inc. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded an after tax loss of $479.0 million consisting of a $48.2 million after tax loss from operations and a $430.8 million after tax loss on the disposal of the KB Toy Division. The buyer purchased the business in conjunction with KB Toys management, who were retained to lead the KB Toy business. Gross proceeds totaled approximately $305 million, consisting primarily of $258 million in cash, a note with a face amount of $45 million, and a warrant to acquire common stock of the buyers parent. The note receivable matures on December 7, 2010 and bears interest at a rate of 8 percent. The interest is payable in annual installments to be paid by issuing additional notes with substantially identical terms as the original note. The warrant provides that the Company is entitled to purchase up to 2.5 percent of the common stock of the buyers parent for a stated per share price. The stock can be purchased any time prior to December 7, 2005. The note and warrant are being accounted for on the cost basis. Proceeds from the sale were used primarily to pay down existing borrowings under the Companys Prior Revolver (defined elsewhere herein). The Company has, as part of the sale agreement, retained the responsibility for certain KB insurance claims incurred through the date of closing of the sale (December 7, 2000). During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the estimate for the related insurance reserves exceeded the expected liability. Accordingly, a portion of the insurance reserves established in connection with the sale of the KB Toy Division were adjusted and recorded as income from discontinued operations on the Companys statement of operations. This adjustment resulted in $8.5 million of after tax income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2001. Non Cash 2001 Fourth Quarter Charge In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a non cash charge of $50.4 million (after tax), or $0.44 per diluted share. The charge represented a) costs to modify the Companys product assortment and exit certain merchandise categories ($6.1 million after tax), b) adjustments to the estimated capitalized freight costs related to inbound imported inventories in response to better systems and information ($15.0 million after tax), c) adjustments to inventory related costs that were identified as a result of the completion of a significant multi year conversion to a detailed stock keeping unit level* inventory management system ($16.7 million after tax), FORM 10 K Page 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and d) changes in estimates and estimating methodology related to insurance reserves ($12.6 million after tax). These charges are included in the Companys 2001 fourth quarter financial statements. A critical element of the Companys overall business strategy has been a multi year initiative to improve its information systems, the final phase of which was completed in fiscal 2001. The new systems have given the Company the ability to track and manage inventories at the SKU level with improved visibility and data. The new systems have also provided better information on inventory balances, and have given management the capability to assess profitability and financial returns down to the SKU level. Based on an analysis of SKU level information, the Company decided to modify its product assortment and exit certain categories of merchandise. This decision allowed the Company to expand its consumables and home dcor categories, both of which management believes have superior financial returns. The markdowns associated with these discontinued products, all of which were taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, accounted for approximately $6.1 million (after tax) of the charge described above. The Company believes this action will result in a more productive assortment and a greater emphasis on the every day consumable items that help drive repeat store traffic. The second component of the charge related to the estimated capitalized import freight costs, which are incurred in connection with inbound inventories sourced from outside the United States. New information systems have improved the Companys ability to manage merchandise flow and freight costs. These improved systems have also provided better information and tools for determining the proper amount of capitalized import freight costs to be recorded on the balance sheet. Accordingly, based on this new information, the Company has revised its estimates and methodology, resulting in a $15.0 million (after tax) charge. The third component of the charge pertained to inventory related costs that had not been allocated to the cost of merchandise in the Companys detailed inventory stock ledger and, accordingly, were not being fully allocated to cost of goods sold. The Company identified this issue in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the conversion to the new SKU based systems, resulting in a $16.7 million (after tax) charge. The fourth and final component of the charge related to insurance reserves. At the end of fiscal 2001, the Company analyzed its insurance reserve accounts and implemented a new methodology that provided better actuarial estimates of future claims. This new methodology, combined with an upward trend in 2001 claims, resulted in a $12.6 million (after tax) charge to increase the Companys insurance reserves. This charge consisted of two elements. The first related to the adjustment of reserves established in connection with the sale of the KB Toy Division, which resulted in $8.5 million (after tax) income from discontinued operations. The second element of the charge was $21.1 million (after tax) to increase reserves related to continuing operations. * Hereinafter the term stock keeping unit is referred to as SKU. FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000 Net Sales Net sales increased to $3,433.3 million for the fifty two week fiscal year 2001 from $3,277.1 million for the fifty three week fiscal 2000, an increase of $156.2 million, or 4.8%. This increase was attributable to sales from 78 new stores, offset in part by the closing of 33 stores, and a comparable store sales increase of 2.0%. Customer transactions increased 0.3% and the value of the average basket increased 1.7%. Comparable store sales growth FORM 10 K Page 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) was driven primarily by sales of consumables, home dcor, and furniture along with incremental volume from conversion stores. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased $44.6 million, or 3.2% in fiscal 2001 to $1,341.1 million from $1,385.7 million in fiscal 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 39.1% in fiscal 2001 compared to 42.3% in the previous year. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to a non cash fourth quarter charge of $37.8 million after tax ($62.4 million before tax). This charge represented the cost to modify the Companys product assortment and exit certain categories, adjustments to the estimated capitalized import freight balances, and inventory related costs that were identified as a result of the completion of a significant multi year conversion to a detailed SKU level inventory management system. The remaining decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to aggressive markdowns and promotions taken to sell through seasonal merchandise and apparel. The decline was also impacted by a shift in product mix as customers increased purchases of lower margin consumable goods and reduced spending on more discretionary, higher margin items. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $168.1 million in fiscal 2001 from $1,200.3 million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 39.9% in fiscal 2001 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2000. The major cause of the increase was due to a $21.1 million after tax ($34.9 million before tax) non cash fourth quarter charge resulting from a change in estimate relating to insurance reserves, combined with an upward trend in 2001 claims. The remaining selling and administrative rate increase was primarily driven by the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales combined with planned strategic initiatives, including increased advertising, store maintenance, and customer service investments. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $20.2 million in fiscal 2001 from $22.9 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in interest expense reflects favorable effective interest rates and a lower average debt balance. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of the Company was 39.5% in both fiscal 2001 and 2000. FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999 Net Sales Net sales increased to $3,277.1 million for the fifty three week fiscal year 2000 from $2,933.7 million for the fifty two week fiscal 1999, an increase of $343.4 million, or 11.7%. This increase was attributable to sales from 83 new stores, offset in part by the closing of 23 stores, and a comparable store sales increase of 3.7% that was driven primarily by sales of seasonal goods and furniture. Customer transactions decreased 2.1% while the value of the average basket increased 5.8%. FORM 10 K Page 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Gross Profit Gross profit increased $120.6 million, or 9.5%, in fiscal 2000 to $1,385.7 million from $1,265.1 million in fiscal 1999. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.3% in 2000 compared to 43.1% in the previous year. The decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to increased markdowns taken in the fourth quarter to drive customer traffic during the holiday season and sell through seasonal merchandise, as well as a shift in the level of consumable merchandise available throughout the year. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $104.8 million in fiscal 2000 from $1,095.5 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 36.6% in fiscal 2000 compared to 37.3% in 1999. Fiscal 2000 selling and administrative rate improvement was primarily attributable to more effective leveraging of fixed expenses in the first two quarters of the year combined with more efficient distribution and transportation throughout the year. Additionally, the Company benefited from the fifty third week of sales in fiscal 2000 as its relatively fixed expense base could be leveraged with the extra week of sales. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $22.9 million in fiscal 2000 from $16.4 million in fiscal 1999. The change in interest expense reflects higher average borrowing levels and higher effective interest rates. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of the Company was 39.5% in both fiscal 2000 and 1999. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY On May 8, 2001, the Company entered into a $512.5 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of financial institutions, which consists of a $358.75 million three year revolving credit facility and a $153.75 million 364 day facility, renewable annually. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the Companys $500 million senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Prior Revolver) that was due to expire on May 6, 2002. The average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Agreement during fiscal 2001 was 5.41 percent. Also on May 8, 2001, the Company completed a $204 million private placement of unsecured senior notes (Senior Notes) with maturities ranging from four to six years. The Senior Notes were issued with a weighted average yield of 7.71 percent and rank parri passu with the Companys Revolving Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issue were used to pay down the Prior Revolver. Both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain specified fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios as well as a minimum level of net worth. On October 30, 2001, the financial covenants of the Revolving Credit Agreement were amended to provide the Company with increased operating flexibility. On February 25, 2002, both the Revolving Credit Agreement and Senior Note Agreement were amended to exclude the non cash 2001 fourth quarter charge, described elsewhere herein, from the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio financial covenant calculations. As part of the FORM 10 K Page 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) amendments, the Company provided collateral, consisting principally of its inventories, as security for both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements, and agreed to certain changes in other terms. The second amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement imposed certain limitations on the extent to which the Company may borrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Companys borrowing base will fluctuate monthly based on the value of the Companys inventory, as determined in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company believes that the value of its inventory, while it will vary seasonally, is sufficient to provide it with the liquidity to meet its borrowing needs. The primary sources of liquidity for the Company have been cash flow from operations, proceeds from the Senior Notes, and as necessary, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Working capital at February 2, 2002, was $672.2 million and for the year then ended net cash provided by operations was $150.9 million. The Company had no direct borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002. At such date, the Company was contingently liable for outstanding letters of credit totaling $32.8 million, and had $17.5 million of invested funds. Capital expenditures were $107.6 million in fiscal 2001, $114.8 million in fiscal 2000, and $83.1 million in fiscal 1999. Capital expenditures in 2001 were primarily driven by investments in strategic initiatives in conjunction with the Companys strategic repositioning, as well as new store openings and the completion of a new distribution center in Tremont, Pennsylvania. Capital expenditures in 1999 and 2000 were primarily driven by new store openings and additional distribution center capacity. Capital expenditure requirements in 2002 are anticipated to be approximately $100 million, primarily to convert remaining stores to the Big Lots name, invest in new stores and store expansions, as well as the continued construction of a new distribution facility in Durant, Oklahoma. The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing, investing, and cash management activities. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates in 2002 to have a material effect on income or cash flows; however, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change. The Company continues to believe that it has, or if necessary has the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses, development of new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on the liquidity, capital resources, financial position or results of operations of the Company. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES As disclosed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement. The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has certain accounting policies which are described below. FORM 10 K Page 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Merchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis, primarily on the retail method. Certain assumptions are made to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market, based on historical experience and current information. Long lived assets. The Company has long lived assets which consist primarily of property and equipment. The Company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets, the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flow of the related long lived assets is calculated and compared to the carrying value on the Companys books. Management believes that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives are appropriate. Insurance reserves. The Company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical benefit claims. The Company has purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to significant claims. Accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. Income taxes. The Company has generated deferred tax assets or liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company records income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations. Pension liabilities. Pension and other retirement benefits, including all relevant assumptions required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, are evaluated each year. Due to the technical nature of retirement accounting, outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations. Since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in retirement benefits, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expenses and obligations. Legal obligations. In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgement on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process, however, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than managements estimates, and adjustments to income could be required. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the Companys accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, with no need for managements judgement in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See the Companys audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At February 2, 2002, the Company operated a total of 1,335 stores operating as BIG LOTS, BIG LOTS FURNITURE, PIC N SAVE, and MAC FRUGALS BARGAINS CLOSEOUTS. Wholesale operations are conducted through BIG LOTS WHOLESALE, CONSOLIDATED INTERNATIONAL, WISCONSIN TOY, and with online shopping at biglotswholesale.com. The following table compares components of the statements of operations of the Company as a percentage of net sales. Results for 2001 include the impact of a $50.4 million (after tax) non cash charge described elsewhere herein. Fiscal Year 2001 2000 1999 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 39.1 42.3 43.1 Selling and administrative expenses 39.9 36.6 37.3 Operating profit (loss) (0.8 ) 5.7 5.8 Interest expense 0.6 0.7 0.6 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (1.4 ) 5.0 5.2 Income tax expense (benefit) (0.6 ) 2.0 2.0 Income (loss) from continuing operations (0.8 ) 3.0 3.2 Discontinued operations 0.2 (14.6 ) 0.1 Net income (loss) (0.6 )% (11.6 )% 3.3 % The Company has historically experienced, and expects to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations, with a significant percentage of its net sales and operating profit being realized in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, the Companys quarterly results can be affected by the timing of store openings and closings, the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores, and the timing of certain holidays. Name Change and Reincorporation On May 16, 2001, the Company announced that it had changed its name to Big Lots, Inc. and its ticker symbol to NYSE: BLI. The name change was approved at the Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 15, 2001. Also approved was a proposal to change the state of the Companys incorporation from Delaware to Ohio. This change was affected by merging Consolidated Stores Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Consolidated (Delaware)), with and into the Company (the Merger). At the effective time of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Consolidated (Delaware) ceased, and the Company succeeded to all business, properties, assets, and liabilities of Consolidated (Delaware). The shares of common stock of Consolidated (Delaware) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger were, by virtue of the Merger, converted into an equal number of shares of fully paid and non assessable common shares of the Company. In connection with this change, all stores under the names of Odd Lots, Mac Frugals, and Pic N Save are being converted to Big Lots over a two year period. Through February 2, 2002, 205 stores had been successfully converted to the Big Lots name. As of the end of fiscal 2001, 1,167 of the Companys 1,335 stores were under the Big Lots name. The Company expects that the remaining stores will be converted to the Big Lots name during 2002. In connection with this process, the Company has made certain improvements to the converted sites. The improvements made vary by location and include, among other things, painting, lighting retrofits, new signage (interior and exterior), new flooring, and updated restrooms. The Company believes that Big Lots is its most recognizable brand name and that this change offers numerous opportunities to increase brand awareness among FORM 10 K Page 14 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) customers, suppliers, investors, and the general public. The Company believes the change will also allow it to leverage future television advertising and other expenses. On August 22, 2001, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had unanimously voted to redeem the preferred stock rights issued under the Companys Rights Agreement, sometimes referred to as a poison pill. The redemption was a direct result of the Companys redomestication into Ohio, as approved by its shareholders at the Companys 2001 Annual Meeting. At the 2000 Annual Meeting, a non binding shareholder proposal passed seeking the termination of the Companys Rights Agreement. The Board believes that the statutory protections offered by the Companys new state of incorporation provide adequate safeguards to permit the Board and the Companys shareholders to fully and fairly evaluate any takeover offer, whether coercive or not. Accordingly, the Board found it to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to redeem the preferred stock rights issued under the Rights Agreement. Sale of Division On June 27, 2000, the Company announced its decision to separate the toy and closeout businesses by divesting the Companys KB Toy Division. The financial statements and notes have been reclassified for all applicable periods presented to reflect the toy segment as a discontinued operation. On December 7, 2000, the Company closed the sale of its KB Toy Division to an affiliate of Bain Capital, Inc. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded an after tax loss of $479.0 million consisting of a $48.2 million after tax loss from operations and a $430.8 million after tax loss on the disposal of the KB Toy Division. The buyer purchased the business in conjunction with KB Toys management, who were retained to lead the KB Toy business. Gross proceeds totaled approximately $305 million, consisting primarily of $258 million in cash, a note with a face amount of $45 million, and a warrant to acquire common stock of the buyers parent. The note receivable matures on December 7, 2010 and bears interest at a rate of 8 percent. The interest is payable in annual installments to be paid by issuing additional notes with substantially identical terms as the original note. The warrant provides that the Company is entitled to purchase up to 2.5 percent of the common stock of the buyers parent for a stated per share price. The stock can be purchased any time prior to December 7, 2005. The note and warrant are being accounted for on the cost basis. Proceeds from the sale were used primarily to pay down existing borrowings under the Companys Prior Revolver (defined elsewhere herein). The Company has, as part of the sale agreement, retained the responsibility for certain KB insurance claims incurred through the date of closing of the sale (December 7, 2000). During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the estimate for the related insurance reserves exceeded the expected liability. Accordingly, a portion of the insurance reserves established in connection with the sale of the KB Toy Division were adjusted and recorded as income from discontinued operations on the Companys statement of operations. This adjustment resulted in $8.5 million of after tax income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2001. Non Cash 2001 Fourth Quarter Charge In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a non cash charge of $50.4 million (after tax), or $0.44 per diluted share. The charge represented a) costs to modify the Companys product assortment and exit certain merchandise categories ($6.1 million after tax), b) adjustments to the estimated capitalized freight costs related to inbound imported inventories in response to better systems and information ($15.0 million after tax), c) adjustments to inventory related costs that were identified as a result of the completion of a significant multi year conversion to a detailed stock keeping unit level* inventory management system ($16.7 million after tax), FORM 10 K Page 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and d) changes in estimates and estimating methodology related to insurance reserves ($12.6 million after tax). These charges are included in the Companys 2001 fourth quarter financial statements. A critical element of the Companys overall business strategy has been a multi year initiative to improve its information systems, the final phase of which was completed in fiscal 2001. The new systems have given the Company the ability to track and manage inventories at the SKU level with improved visibility and data. The new systems have also provided better information on inventory balances, and have given management the capability to assess profitability and financial returns down to the SKU level. Based on an analysis of SKU level information, the Company decided to modify its product assortment and exit certain categories of merchandise. This decision allowed the Company to expand its consumables and home dcor categories, both of which management believes have superior financial returns. The markdowns associated with these discontinued products, all of which were taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, accounted for approximately $6.1 million (after tax) of the charge described above. The Company believes this action will result in a more productive assortment and a greater emphasis on the every day consumable items that help drive repeat store traffic. The second component of the charge related to the estimated capitalized import freight costs, which are incurred in connection with inbound inventories sourced from outside the United States. New information systems have improved the Companys ability to manage merchandise flow and freight costs. These improved systems have also provided better information and tools for determining the proper amount of capitalized import freight costs to be recorded on the balance sheet. Accordingly, based on this new information, the Company has revised its estimates and methodology, resulting in a $15.0 million (after tax) charge. The third component of the charge pertained to inventory related costs that had not been allocated to the cost of merchandise in the Companys detailed inventory stock ledger and, accordingly, were not being fully allocated to cost of goods sold. The Company identified this issue in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the conversion to the new SKU based systems, resulting in a $16.7 million (after tax) charge. The fourth and final component of the charge related to insurance reserves. At the end of fiscal 2001, the Company analyzed its insurance reserve accounts and implemented a new methodology that provided better actuarial estimates of future claims. This new methodology, combined with an upward trend in 2001 claims, resulted in a $12.6 million (after tax) charge to increase the Companys insurance reserves. This charge consisted of two elements. The first related to the adjustment of reserves established in connection with the sale of the KB Toy Division, which resulted in $8.5 million (after tax) income from discontinued operations. The second element of the charge was $21.1 million (after tax) to increase reserves related to continuing operations. * Hereinafter the term stock keeping unit is referred to as SKU. FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000 Net Sales Net sales increased to $3,433.3 million for the fifty two week fiscal year 2001 from $3,277.1 million for the fifty three week fiscal 2000, an increase of $156.2 million, or 4.8%. This increase was attributable to sales from 78 new stores, offset in part by the closing of 33 stores, and a comparable store sales increase of 2.0%. Customer transactions increased 0.3% and the value of the average basket increased 1.7%. Comparable store sales growth FORM 10 K Page 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) was driven primarily by sales of consumables, home dcor, and furniture along with incremental volume from conversion stores. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased $44.6 million, or 3.2% in fiscal 2001 to $1,341.1 million from $1,385.7 million in fiscal 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 39.1% in fiscal 2001 compared to 42.3% in the previous year. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to a non cash fourth quarter charge of $37.8 million after tax ($62.4 million before tax). This charge represented the cost to modify the Companys product assortment and exit certain categories, adjustments to the estimated capitalized import freight balances, and inventory related costs that were identified as a result of the completion of a significant multi year conversion to a detailed SKU level inventory management system. The remaining decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to aggressive markdowns and promotions taken to sell through seasonal merchandise and apparel. The decline was also impacted by a shift in product mix as customers increased purchases of lower margin consumable goods and reduced spending on more discretionary, higher margin items. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $168.1 million in fiscal 2001 from $1,200.3 million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 39.9% in fiscal 2001 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2000. The major cause of the increase was due to a $21.1 million after tax ($34.9 million before tax) non cash fourth quarter charge resulting from a change in estimate relating to insurance reserves, combined with an upward trend in 2001 claims. The remaining selling and administrative rate increase was primarily driven by the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales combined with planned strategic initiatives, including increased advertising, store maintenance, and customer service investments. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $20.2 million in fiscal 2001 from $22.9 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in interest expense reflects favorable effective interest rates and a lower average debt balance. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of the Company was 39.5% in both fiscal 2001 and 2000. FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999 Net Sales Net sales increased to $3,277.1 million for the fifty three week fiscal year 2000 from $2,933.7 million for the fifty two week fiscal 1999, an increase of $343.4 million, or 11.7%. This increase was attributable to sales from 83 new stores, offset in part by the closing of 23 stores, and a comparable store sales increase of 3.7% that was driven primarily by sales of seasonal goods and furniture. Customer transactions decreased 2.1% while the value of the average basket increased 5.8%. FORM 10 K Page 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Gross Profit Gross profit increased $120.6 million, or 9.5%, in fiscal 2000 to $1,385.7 million from $1,265.1 million in fiscal 1999. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.3% in 2000 compared to 43.1% in the previous year. The decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to increased markdowns taken in the fourth quarter to drive customer traffic during the holiday season and sell through seasonal merchandise, as well as a shift in the level of consumable merchandise available throughout the year. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $104.8 million in fiscal 2000 from $1,095.5 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 36.6% in fiscal 2000 compared to 37.3% in 1999. Fiscal 2000 selling and administrative rate improvement was primarily attributable to more effective leveraging of fixed expenses in the first two quarters of the year combined with more efficient distribution and transportation throughout the year. Additionally, the Company benefited from the fifty third week of sales in fiscal 2000 as its relatively fixed expense base could be leveraged with the extra week of sales. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $22.9 million in fiscal 2000 from $16.4 million in fiscal 1999. The change in interest expense reflects higher average borrowing levels and higher effective interest rates. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of the Company was 39.5% in both fiscal 2000 and 1999. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY On May 8, 2001, the Company entered into a $512.5 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of financial institutions, which consists of a $358.75 million three year revolving credit facility and a $153.75 million 364 day facility, renewable annually. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the Companys $500 million senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Prior Revolver) that was due to expire on May 6, 2002. The average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Agreement during fiscal 2001 was 5.41 percent. Also on May 8, 2001, the Company completed a $204 million private placement of unsecured senior notes (Senior Notes) with maturities ranging from four to six years. The Senior Notes were issued with a weighted average yield of 7.71 percent and rank parri passu with the Companys Revolving Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issue were used to pay down the Prior Revolver. Both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain specified fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios as well as a minimum level of net worth. On October 30, 2001, the financial covenants of the Revolving Credit Agreement were amended to provide the Company with increased operating flexibility. On February 25, 2002, both the Revolving Credit Agreement and Senior Note Agreement were amended to exclude the non cash 2001 fourth quarter charge, described elsewhere herein, from the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio financial covenant calculations. As part of the FORM 10 K Page 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) amendments, the Company provided collateral, consisting principally of its inventories, as security for both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements, and agreed to certain changes in other terms. The second amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement imposed certain limitations on the extent to which the Company may borrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Companys borrowing base will fluctuate monthly based on the value of the Companys inventory, as determined in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company believes that the value of its inventory, while it will vary seasonally, is sufficient to provide it with the liquidity to meet its borrowing needs. The primary sources of liquidity for the Company have been cash flow from operations, proceeds from the Senior Notes, and as necessary, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Working capital at February 2, 2002, was $672.2 million and for the year then ended net cash provided by operations was $150.9 million. The Company had no direct borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002. At such date, the Company was contingently liable for outstanding letters of credit totaling $32.8 million, and had $17.5 million of invested funds. Capital expenditures were $107.6 million in fiscal 2001, $114.8 million in fiscal 2000, and $83.1 million in fiscal 1999. Capital expenditures in 2001 were primarily driven by investments in strategic initiatives in conjunction with the Companys strategic repositioning, as well as new store openings and the completion of a new distribution center in Tremont, Pennsylvania. Capital expenditures in 1999 and 2000 were primarily driven by new store openings and additional distribution center capacity. Capital expenditure requirements in 2002 are anticipated to be approximately $100 million, primarily to convert remaining stores to the Big Lots name, invest in new stores and store expansions, as well as the continued construction of a new distribution facility in Durant, Oklahoma. The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing, investing, and cash management activities. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates in 2002 to have a material effect on income or cash flows; however, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change. The Company continues to believe that it has, or if necessary has the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses, development of new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on the liquidity, capital resources, financial position or results of operations of the Company. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES As disclosed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement. The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has certain accounting policies which are described below. FORM 10 K Page 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Merchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis, primarily on the retail method. Certain assumptions are made to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market, based on historical experience and current information. Long lived assets. The Company has long lived assets which consist primarily of property and equipment. The Company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets, the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flow of the related long lived assets is calculated and compared to the carrying value on the Companys books. Management believes that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives are appropriate. Insurance reserves. The Company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical benefit claims. The Company has purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to significant claims. Accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. Income taxes. The Company has generated deferred tax assets or liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company records income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations. Pension liabilities. Pension and other retirement benefits, including all relevant assumptions required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, are evaluated each year. Due to the technical nature of retirement accounting, outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations. Since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in retirement benefits, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expenses and obligations. Legal obligations. In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgement on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process, however, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than managements estimates, and adjustments to income could be required. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the Companys accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, with no need for managements judgement in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See the Companys audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) customers, suppliers, investors, and the general public. The Company believes the change will also allow it to leverage future television advertising and other expenses. On August 22, 2001, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had unanimously voted to redeem the preferred stock rights issued under the Companys Rights Agreement, sometimes referred to as a poison pill. The redemption was a direct result of the Companys redomestication into Ohio, as approved by its shareholders at the Companys 2001 Annual Meeting. At the 2000 Annual Meeting, a non binding shareholder proposal passed seeking the termination of the Companys Rights Agreement. The Board believes that the statutory protections offered by the Companys new state of incorporation provide adequate safeguards to permit the Board and the Companys shareholders to fully and fairly evaluate any takeover offer, whether coercive or not. Accordingly, the Board found it to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to redeem the preferred stock rights issued under the Rights Agreement. Sale of Division On June 27, 2000, the Company announced its decision to separate the toy and closeout businesses by divesting the Companys KB Toy Division. The financial statements and notes have been reclassified for all applicable periods presented to reflect the toy segment as a discontinued operation. On December 7, 2000, the Company closed the sale of its KB Toy Division to an affiliate of Bain Capital, Inc. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded an after tax loss of $479.0 million consisting of a $48.2 million after tax loss from operations and a $430.8 million after tax loss on the disposal of the KB Toy Division. The buyer purchased the business in conjunction with KB Toys management, who were retained to lead the KB Toy business. Gross proceeds totaled approximately $305 million, consisting primarily of $258 million in cash, a note with a face amount of $45 million, and a warrant to acquire common stock of the buyers parent. The note receivable matures on December 7, 2010 and bears interest at a rate of 8 percent. The interest is payable in annual installments to be paid by issuing additional notes with substantially identical terms as the original note. The warrant provides that the Company is entitled to purchase up to 2.5 percent of the common stock of the buyers parent for a stated per share price. The stock can be purchased any time prior to December 7, 2005. The note and warrant are being accounted for on the cost basis. Proceeds from the sale were used primarily to pay down existing borrowings under the Companys Prior Revolver (defined elsewhere herein). The Company has, as part of the sale agreement, retained the responsibility for certain KB insurance claims incurred through the date of closing of the sale (December 7, 2000). During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the estimate for the related insurance reserves exceeded the expected liability. Accordingly, a portion of the insurance reserves established in connection with the sale of the KB Toy Division were adjusted and recorded as income from discontinued operations on the Companys statement of operations. This adjustment resulted in $8.5 million of after tax income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2001. Non Cash 2001 Fourth Quarter Charge In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a non cash charge of $50.4 million (after tax), or $0.44 per diluted share. The charge represented a) costs to modify the Companys product assortment and exit certain merchandise categories ($6.1 million after tax), b) adjustments to the estimated capitalized freight costs related to inbound imported inventories in response to better systems and information ($15.0 million after tax), c) adjustments to inventory related costs that were identified as a result of the completion of a significant multi year conversion to a detailed stock keeping unit level* inventory management system ($16.7 million after tax), FORM 10 K Page 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and d) changes in estimates and estimating methodology related to insurance reserves ($12.6 million after tax). These charges are included in the Companys 2001 fourth quarter financial statements. A critical element of the Companys overall business strategy has been a multi year initiative to improve its information systems, the final phase of which was completed in fiscal 2001. The new systems have given the Company the ability to track and manage inventories at the SKU level with improved visibility and data. The new systems have also provided better information on inventory balances, and have given management the capability to assess profitability and financial returns down to the SKU level. Based on an analysis of SKU level information, the Company decided to modify its product assortment and exit certain categories of merchandise. This decision allowed the Company to expand its consumables and home dcor categories, both of which management believes have superior financial returns. The markdowns associated with these discontinued products, all of which were taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, accounted for approximately $6.1 million (after tax) of the charge described above. The Company believes this action will result in a more productive assortment and a greater emphasis on the every day consumable items that help drive repeat store traffic. The second component of the charge related to the estimated capitalized import freight costs, which are incurred in connection with inbound inventories sourced from outside the United States. New information systems have improved the Companys ability to manage merchandise flow and freight costs. These improved systems have also provided better information and tools for determining the proper amount of capitalized import freight costs to be recorded on the balance sheet. Accordingly, based on this new information, the Company has revised its estimates and methodology, resulting in a $15.0 million (after tax) charge. The third component of the charge pertained to inventory related costs that had not been allocated to the cost of merchandise in the Companys detailed inventory stock ledger and, accordingly, were not being fully allocated to cost of goods sold. The Company identified this issue in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the conversion to the new SKU based systems, resulting in a $16.7 million (after tax) charge. The fourth and final component of the charge related to insurance reserves. At the end of fiscal 2001, the Company analyzed its insurance reserve accounts and implemented a new methodology that provided better actuarial estimates of future claims. This new methodology, combined with an upward trend in 2001 claims, resulted in a $12.6 million (after tax) charge to increase the Companys insurance reserves. This charge consisted of two elements. The first related to the adjustment of reserves established in connection with the sale of the KB Toy Division, which resulted in $8.5 million (after tax) income from discontinued operations. The second element of the charge was $21.1 million (after tax) to increase reserves related to continuing operations. * Hereinafter the term stock keeping unit is referred to as SKU. FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000 Net Sales Net sales increased to $3,433.3 million for the fifty two week fiscal year 2001 from $3,277.1 million for the fifty three week fiscal 2000, an increase of $156.2 million, or 4.8%. This increase was attributable to sales from 78 new stores, offset in part by the closing of 33 stores, and a comparable store sales increase of 2.0%. Customer transactions increased 0.3% and the value of the average basket increased 1.7%. Comparable store sales growth FORM 10 K Page 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) was driven primarily by sales of consumables, home dcor, and furniture along with incremental volume from conversion stores. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased $44.6 million, or 3.2% in fiscal 2001 to $1,341.1 million from $1,385.7 million in fiscal 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 39.1% in fiscal 2001 compared to 42.3% in the previous year. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to a non cash fourth quarter charge of $37.8 million after tax ($62.4 million before tax). This charge represented the cost to modify the Companys product assortment and exit certain categories, adjustments to the estimated capitalized import freight balances, and inventory related costs that were identified as a result of the completion of a significant multi year conversion to a detailed SKU level inventory management system. The remaining decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to aggressive markdowns and promotions taken to sell through seasonal merchandise and apparel. The decline was also impacted by a shift in product mix as customers increased purchases of lower margin consumable goods and reduced spending on more discretionary, higher margin items. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $168.1 million in fiscal 2001 from $1,200.3 million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 39.9% in fiscal 2001 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2000. The major cause of the increase was due to a $21.1 million after tax ($34.9 million before tax) non cash fourth quarter charge resulting from a change in estimate relating to insurance reserves, combined with an upward trend in 2001 claims. The remaining selling and administrative rate increase was primarily driven by the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales combined with planned strategic initiatives, including increased advertising, store maintenance, and customer service investments. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $20.2 million in fiscal 2001 from $22.9 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in interest expense reflects favorable effective interest rates and a lower average debt balance. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of the Company was 39.5% in both fiscal 2001 and 2000. FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999 Net Sales Net sales increased to $3,277.1 million for the fifty three week fiscal year 2000 from $2,933.7 million for the fifty two week fiscal 1999, an increase of $343.4 million, or 11.7%. This increase was attributable to sales from 83 new stores, offset in part by the closing of 23 stores, and a comparable store sales increase of 3.7% that was driven primarily by sales of seasonal goods and furniture. Customer transactions decreased 2.1% while the value of the average basket increased 5.8%. FORM 10 K Page 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Gross Profit Gross profit increased $120.6 million, or 9.5%, in fiscal 2000 to $1,385.7 million from $1,265.1 million in fiscal 1999. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.3% in 2000 compared to 43.1% in the previous year. The decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to increased markdowns taken in the fourth quarter to drive customer traffic during the holiday season and sell through seasonal merchandise, as well as a shift in the level of consumable merchandise available throughout the year. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $104.8 million in fiscal 2000 from $1,095.5 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 36.6% in fiscal 2000 compared to 37.3% in 1999. Fiscal 2000 selling and administrative rate improvement was primarily attributable to more effective leveraging of fixed expenses in the first two quarters of the year combined with more efficient distribution and transportation throughout the year. Additionally, the Company benefited from the fifty third week of sales in fiscal 2000 as its relatively fixed expense base could be leveraged with the extra week of sales. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $22.9 million in fiscal 2000 from $16.4 million in fiscal 1999. The change in interest expense reflects higher average borrowing levels and higher effective interest rates. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of the Company was 39.5% in both fiscal 2000 and 1999. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY On May 8, 2001, the Company entered into a $512.5 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of financial institutions, which consists of a $358.75 million three year revolving credit facility and a $153.75 million 364 day facility, renewable annually. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the Companys $500 million senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Prior Revolver) that was due to expire on May 6, 2002. The average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Agreement during fiscal 2001 was 5.41 percent. Also on May 8, 2001, the Company completed a $204 million private placement of unsecured senior notes (Senior Notes) with maturities ranging from four to six years. The Senior Notes were issued with a weighted average yield of 7.71 percent and rank parri passu with the Companys Revolving Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issue were used to pay down the Prior Revolver. Both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain specified fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios as well as a minimum level of net worth. On October 30, 2001, the financial covenants of the Revolving Credit Agreement were amended to provide the Company with increased operating flexibility. On February 25, 2002, both the Revolving Credit Agreement and Senior Note Agreement were amended to exclude the non cash 2001 fourth quarter charge, described elsewhere herein, from the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio financial covenant calculations. As part of the FORM 10 K Page 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) amendments, the Company provided collateral, consisting principally of its inventories, as security for both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements, and agreed to certain changes in other terms. The second amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement imposed certain limitations on the extent to which the Company may borrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Companys borrowing base will fluctuate monthly based on the value of the Companys inventory, as determined in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company believes that the value of its inventory, while it will vary seasonally, is sufficient to provide it with the liquidity to meet its borrowing needs. The primary sources of liquidity for the Company have been cash flow from operations, proceeds from the Senior Notes, and as necessary, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Working capital at February 2, 2002, was $672.2 million and for the year then ended net cash provided by operations was $150.9 million. The Company had no direct borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002. At such date, the Company was contingently liable for outstanding letters of credit totaling $32.8 million, and had $17.5 million of invested funds. Capital expenditures were $107.6 million in fiscal 2001, $114.8 million in fiscal 2000, and $83.1 million in fiscal 1999. Capital expenditures in 2001 were primarily driven by investments in strategic initiatives in conjunction with the Companys strategic repositioning, as well as new store openings and the completion of a new distribution center in Tremont, Pennsylvania. Capital expenditures in 1999 and 2000 were primarily driven by new store openings and additional distribution center capacity. Capital expenditure requirements in 2002 are anticipated to be approximately $100 million, primarily to convert remaining stores to the Big Lots name, invest in new stores and store expansions, as well as the continued construction of a new distribution facility in Durant, Oklahoma. The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing, investing, and cash management activities. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates in 2002 to have a material effect on income or cash flows; however, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change. The Company continues to believe that it has, or if necessary has the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses, development of new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on the liquidity, capital resources, financial position or results of operations of the Company. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES As disclosed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement. The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has certain accounting policies which are described below. FORM 10 K Page 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Merchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis, primarily on the retail method. Certain assumptions are made to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market, based on historical experience and current information. Long lived assets. The Company has long lived assets which consist primarily of property and equipment. The Company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets, the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flow of the related long lived assets is calculated and compared to the carrying value on the Companys books. Management believes that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives are appropriate. Insurance reserves. The Company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical benefit claims. The Company has purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to significant claims. Accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. Income taxes. The Company has generated deferred tax assets or liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company records income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations. Pension liabilities. Pension and other retirement benefits, including all relevant assumptions required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, are evaluated each year. Due to the technical nature of retirement accounting, outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations. Since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in retirement benefits, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expenses and obligations. Legal obligations. In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgement on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process, however, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than managements estimates, and adjustments to income could be required. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the Companys accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, with no need for managements judgement in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and d) changes in estimates and estimating methodology related to insurance reserves ($12.6 million after tax). These charges are included in the Companys 2001 fourth quarter financial statements. A critical element of the Companys overall business strategy has been a multi year initiative to improve its information systems, the final phase of which was completed in fiscal 2001. The new systems have given the Company the ability to track and manage inventories at the SKU level with improved visibility and data. The new systems have also provided better information on inventory balances, and have given management the capability to assess profitability and financial returns down to the SKU level. Based on an analysis of SKU level information, the Company decided to modify its product assortment and exit certain categories of merchandise. This decision allowed the Company to expand its consumables and home dcor categories, both of which management believes have superior financial returns. The markdowns associated with these discontinued products, all of which were taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, accounted for approximately $6.1 million (after tax) of the charge described above. The Company believes this action will result in a more productive assortment and a greater emphasis on the every day consumable items that help drive repeat store traffic. The second component of the charge related to the estimated capitalized import freight costs, which are incurred in connection with inbound inventories sourced from outside the United States. New information systems have improved the Companys ability to manage merchandise flow and freight costs. These improved systems have also provided better information and tools for determining the proper amount of capitalized import freight costs to be recorded on the balance sheet. Accordingly, based on this new information, the Company has revised its estimates and methodology, resulting in a $15.0 million (after tax) charge. The third component of the charge pertained to inventory related costs that had not been allocated to the cost of merchandise in the Companys detailed inventory stock ledger and, accordingly, were not being fully allocated to cost of goods sold. The Company identified this issue in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the conversion to the new SKU based systems, resulting in a $16.7 million (after tax) charge. The fourth and final component of the charge related to insurance reserves. At the end of fiscal 2001, the Company analyzed its insurance reserve accounts and implemented a new methodology that provided better actuarial estimates of future claims. This new methodology, combined with an upward trend in 2001 claims, resulted in a $12.6 million (after tax) charge to increase the Companys insurance reserves. This charge consisted of two elements. The first related to the adjustment of reserves established in connection with the sale of the KB Toy Division, which resulted in $8.5 million (after tax) income from discontinued operations. The second element of the charge was $21.1 million (after tax) to increase reserves related to continuing operations. * Hereinafter the term stock keeping unit is referred to as SKU. FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000 Net Sales Net sales increased to $3,433.3 million for the fifty two week fiscal year 2001 from $3,277.1 million for the fifty three week fiscal 2000, an increase of $156.2 million, or 4.8%. This increase was attributable to sales from 78 new stores, offset in part by the closing of 33 stores, and a comparable store sales increase of 2.0%. Customer transactions increased 0.3% and the value of the average basket increased 1.7%. Comparable store sales growth FORM 10 K Page 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) was driven primarily by sales of consumables, home dcor, and furniture along with incremental volume from conversion stores. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased $44.6 million, or 3.2% in fiscal 2001 to $1,341.1 million from $1,385.7 million in fiscal 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 39.1% in fiscal 2001 compared to 42.3% in the previous year. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to a non cash fourth quarter charge of $37.8 million after tax ($62.4 million before tax). This charge represented the cost to modify the Companys product assortment and exit certain categories, adjustments to the estimated capitalized import freight balances, and inventory related costs that were identified as a result of the completion of a significant multi year conversion to a detailed SKU level inventory management system. The remaining decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to aggressive markdowns and promotions taken to sell through seasonal merchandise and apparel. The decline was also impacted by a shift in product mix as customers increased purchases of lower margin consumable goods and reduced spending on more discretionary, higher margin items. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $168.1 million in fiscal 2001 from $1,200.3 million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 39.9% in fiscal 2001 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2000. The major cause of the increase was due to a $21.1 million after tax ($34.9 million before tax) non cash fourth quarter charge resulting from a change in estimate relating to insurance reserves, combined with an upward trend in 2001 claims. The remaining selling and administrative rate increase was primarily driven by the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales combined with planned strategic initiatives, including increased advertising, store maintenance, and customer service investments. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $20.2 million in fiscal 2001 from $22.9 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in interest expense reflects favorable effective interest rates and a lower average debt balance. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of the Company was 39.5% in both fiscal 2001 and 2000. FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999 Net Sales Net sales increased to $3,277.1 million for the fifty three week fiscal year 2000 from $2,933.7 million for the fifty two week fiscal 1999, an increase of $343.4 million, or 11.7%. This increase was attributable to sales from 83 new stores, offset in part by the closing of 23 stores, and a comparable store sales increase of 3.7% that was driven primarily by sales of seasonal goods and furniture. Customer transactions decreased 2.1% while the value of the average basket increased 5.8%. FORM 10 K Page 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Gross Profit Gross profit increased $120.6 million, or 9.5%, in fiscal 2000 to $1,385.7 million from $1,265.1 million in fiscal 1999. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.3% in 2000 compared to 43.1% in the previous year. The decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to increased markdowns taken in the fourth quarter to drive customer traffic during the holiday season and sell through seasonal merchandise, as well as a shift in the level of consumable merchandise available throughout the year. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $104.8 million in fiscal 2000 from $1,095.5 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 36.6% in fiscal 2000 compared to 37.3% in 1999. Fiscal 2000 selling and administrative rate improvement was primarily attributable to more effective leveraging of fixed expenses in the first two quarters of the year combined with more efficient distribution and transportation throughout the year. Additionally, the Company benefited from the fifty third week of sales in fiscal 2000 as its relatively fixed expense base could be leveraged with the extra week of sales. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $22.9 million in fiscal 2000 from $16.4 million in fiscal 1999. The change in interest expense reflects higher average borrowing levels and higher effective interest rates. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of the Company was 39.5% in both fiscal 2000 and 1999. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY On May 8, 2001, the Company entered into a $512.5 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of financial institutions, which consists of a $358.75 million three year revolving credit facility and a $153.75 million 364 day facility, renewable annually. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the Companys $500 million senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Prior Revolver) that was due to expire on May 6, 2002. The average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Agreement during fiscal 2001 was 5.41 percent. Also on May 8, 2001, the Company completed a $204 million private placement of unsecured senior notes (Senior Notes) with maturities ranging from four to six years. The Senior Notes were issued with a weighted average yield of 7.71 percent and rank parri passu with the Companys Revolving Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issue were used to pay down the Prior Revolver. Both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain specified fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios as well as a minimum level of net worth. On October 30, 2001, the financial covenants of the Revolving Credit Agreement were amended to provide the Company with increased operating flexibility. On February 25, 2002, both the Revolving Credit Agreement and Senior Note Agreement were amended to exclude the non cash 2001 fourth quarter charge, described elsewhere herein, from the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio financial covenant calculations. As part of the FORM 10 K Page 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) amendments, the Company provided collateral, consisting principally of its inventories, as security for both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements, and agreed to certain changes in other terms. The second amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement imposed certain limitations on the extent to which the Company may borrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Companys borrowing base will fluctuate monthly based on the value of the Companys inventory, as determined in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company believes that the value of its inventory, while it will vary seasonally, is sufficient to provide it with the liquidity to meet its borrowing needs. The primary sources of liquidity for the Company have been cash flow from operations, proceeds from the Senior Notes, and as necessary, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Working capital at February 2, 2002, was $672.2 million and for the year then ended net cash provided by operations was $150.9 million. The Company had no direct borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002. At such date, the Company was contingently liable for outstanding letters of credit totaling $32.8 million, and had $17.5 million of invested funds. Capital expenditures were $107.6 million in fiscal 2001, $114.8 million in fiscal 2000, and $83.1 million in fiscal 1999. Capital expenditures in 2001 were primarily driven by investments in strategic initiatives in conjunction with the Companys strategic repositioning, as well as new store openings and the completion of a new distribution center in Tremont, Pennsylvania. Capital expenditures in 1999 and 2000 were primarily driven by new store openings and additional distribution center capacity. Capital expenditure requirements in 2002 are anticipated to be approximately $100 million, primarily to convert remaining stores to the Big Lots name, invest in new stores and store expansions, as well as the continued construction of a new distribution facility in Durant, Oklahoma. The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing, investing, and cash management activities. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates in 2002 to have a material effect on income or cash flows; however, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change. The Company continues to believe that it has, or if necessary has the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses, development of new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on the liquidity, capital resources, financial position or results of operations of the Company. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES As disclosed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement. The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has certain accounting policies which are described below.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Gross Profit Gross profit increased $120.6 million, or 9.5%, in fiscal 2000 to $1,385.7 million from $1,265.1 million in fiscal 1999. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.3% in 2000 compared to 43.1% in the previous year.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY On May 8, 2001, the Company entered into a $512.5 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of financial institutions, which consists of a $358.75 million three year revolving credit facility and a $153.75 million 364 day facility, renewable annually. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the Companys $500 million senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Prior Revolver) that was due to expire on May 6, 2002. The average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Agreement during fiscal 2001 was 5.41 percent. Also on May 8, 2001, the Company completed a $204 million private placement of unsecured senior notes (Senior Notes) with maturities ranging from four to six years. The Senior Notes were issued with a weighted average yield of 7.71 percent and rank parri passu with the Companys Revolving Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issue were used to pay down the Prior Revolver. Both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain specified fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios as well as a minimum level of net worth. On October 30, 2001, the financial covenants of the Revolving Credit Agreement were amended to provide the Company with increased operating flexibility. On February 25, 2002, both the Revolving Credit Agreement and Senior Note Agreement were amended to exclude the non cash 2001 fourth quarter charge, described elsewhere herein, from the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio financial covenant calculations. As part of the FORM 10 K Page 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) amendments, the Company provided collateral, consisting principally of its inventories, as security for both the Revolving Credit and Senior Note Agreements, and agreed to certain changes in other terms. The second amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement imposed certain limitations on the extent to which the Company may borrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Companys borrowing base will fluctuate monthly based on the value of the Companys inventory, as determined in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company believes that the value of its inventory, while it will vary seasonally, is sufficient to provide it with the liquidity to meet its borrowing needs. The primary sources of liquidity for the Company have been cash flow from operations, proceeds from the Senior Notes, and as necessary, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Working capital at February 2, 2002, was $672.2 million and for the year then ended net cash provided by operations was $150.9 million. The Company had no direct borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002. At such date, the Company was contingently liable for outstanding letters of credit totaling $32.8 million, and had $17.5 million of invested funds. Capital expenditures were $107.6 million in fiscal 2001, $114.8 million in fiscal 2000, and $83.1 million in fiscal 1999. Capital expenditures in 2001 were primarily driven by investments in strategic initiatives in conjunction with the Companys strategic repositioning, as well as new store openings and the completion of a new distribution center in Tremont, Pennsylvania. Capital expenditures in 1999 and 2000 were primarily driven by new store openings and additional distribution center capacity. Capital expenditure requirements in 2002 are anticipated to be approximately $100 million, primarily to convert remaining stores to the Big Lots name, invest in new stores and store expansions, as well as the continued construction of a new distribution facility in Durant, Oklahoma. The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing, investing, and cash management activities. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates in 2002 to have a material effect on income or cash flows; however, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change. The Company continues to believe that it has, or if necessary has the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses, development of new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on the liquidity, capital resources, financial position or results of operations of the Company. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES As disclosed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement. The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has certain accounting policies which are described below. FORM 10 K Page 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Merchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis, primarily on the retail method. Certain assumptions are made to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market, based on historical experience and current information. Long lived assets. The Company has long lived assets which consist primarily of property and equipment. The Company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets, the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flow of the related long lived assets is calculated and compared to the carrying value on the Companys books. Management believes that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives are appropriate. Insurance reserves. The Company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical benefit claims. The Company has purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to significant claims. Accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. Income taxes. The Company has generated deferred tax assets or liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company records income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations. Pension liabilities. Pension and other retirement benefits, including all relevant assumptions required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, are evaluated each year. Due to the technical nature of retirement accounting, outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations. Since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in retirement benefits, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expenses and obligations. Legal obligations. In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgement on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process, however, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than managements estimates, and adjustments to income could be required. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the Companys accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, with no need for managements judgement in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See the Companys audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
