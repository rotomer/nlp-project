ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements for Purposes of Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act) provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statements. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Act. This report, as well as other verbal or written statements or reports made by or on the behalf of the Company, may contain or may incorporate material by reference which includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act. By their nature, all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Statements, other than those based on historical facts, which address activities, events, or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), business strategy, expansion and growth of the Companys business and operations, future earnings, store openings and new market entries, anticipated inventory turn, and other similar matters, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events, are forward looking statements, which are based upon a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. The words believe, anticipate, project, plan, expect, estimate, objective, forecast, goal, intend, and similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements. The forward looking statements are and will be based upon managements then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. Although the Company believes the expectations expressed in forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business, actual events and results may materially differ from anticipated results described in such statements. The Companys ability to achieve the results contemplated by forward looking statements is subject to a number of factors, any one, or a combination, of which could materially affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. These factors may include, but are not limited to: the Companys ability to source and purchase merchandise on favorable terms; interruptions and delays in merchandise supply from the Companys and its vendors foreign and domestic sources; risks associated with purchasing, directly or indirectly, merchandise from foreign sources, including increased import duties and taxes, imposition of more restrictive quotas, loss of most favored nation trading status, currency fluctuations, work stoppages, transportation delays, foreign government regulations, political unrest, natural disasters, war, terrorism, and trade restrictions, including retaliation by the United States against foreign practices; the ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers; the Companys ability to establish effective advertising, marketing, and promotional programs; economic and weather conditions which affect buying patterns of the Companys customers; changes in consumer spending and consumer debt levels; the Companys ability to anticipate buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies; continued availability of capital and financing on favorable terms; competitive pressures and pricing pressures, including competition from other retailers; the Companys ability to comply with the terms of its credit facilities (or obtain waivers for noncompliance); 13 significant interest rate fluctuations and changes in the Companys credit rating; the creditworthiness of the purchaser of the Companys former KB Toys business; the Companys indemnification and guarantee obligations with respect to approximately 390 KB Toys store leases and other real property leases, some or all of which may be rejected or materially modified in connection with the pending KB Toys bankruptcy proceedings, as well as other potential costs arising out of the KB Toys bankruptcy; litigation risks and changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, the interpretation and application of accounting standards, and tax laws; transportation and distribution delays or interruptions that adversely impact the Companys ability to receive and or distribute inventory; the impact on transportation costs from the driver hours of service regulations adopted by the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration that became effective in January 2004; the effect of fuel price fluctuations on the Companys transportation costs and customer purchases; interruptions in suppliers businesses; the Companys ability to achieve cost efficiencies and other benefits from various operational initiatives and technological enhancements; the costs, interruptions, and problems associated with the implementation of, or failure to implement, new or upgraded systems and technology; the effect of international freight rates and domestic transportation costs on the Companys profitability; delays and costs associated with building, opening, and modifying the Companys distribution centers; the Companys ability to secure suitable new store locations under favorable lease terms; the Companys ability to successfully enter new markets; delays associated with constructing, opening, and operating new stores; the Companys ability to attract and retain suitable employees; and other risks described from time to time in the Companys filings with the SEC, in its press releases, and in other communications. The foregoing list is not exhaustive. There can be no assurances that the Company has correctly and completely identified, assessed, and accounted for all factors that do or may affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or that it believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the Company. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Consequently, all of the forward looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or that they will have the expected effects on the Company or its business or operations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements contained in this report, or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the Company may make on related subjects in its public announcements and SEC filings. Overview The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere herein. 14 Business Operations The Company is the nations largest broadline closeout retailer. At January 29, 2005, the Company operated a total of 1,502 stores in 46 states with 1,459 stores under the name Big Lots and 43 stores under the name Big Lots Furniture. The Companys goal is to build upon its leadership position in broadline closeout retailing by expanding its market presence in both existing and new markets. The Company believes that the combination of its strengths make it a low cost value retailer well positioned for continued growth. The Companys Web site is located at www.biglots.com. Wholesale operations are conducted through Big Lots Wholesale, Consolidated International, Wisconsin Toy, with online sales at www.biglotswholesale.com. The contents of the Companys Web sites are not part of this report. The following table compares components of the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the Company as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 59.4 58.2 57.8 Gross profit 40.6 41.8 42.2 Selling and administrative expenses 36.7 36.5 36.2 Depreciation expense 2.4 2.2 2.2 Operating profit 1.5 3.1 3.8 Interest expense 0.5 0.4 0.5 Interest income (0.0 ) (0.0 ) (0.0 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1.0 2.7 3.3 Income tax expense 0.3 0.6 1.3 Income from continuing operations 0.7 2.1 2.0 Loss from discontinued operations (0.2 ) (0.2 ) 0.0 Net income 0.5 % 1.9 % 2.0 % The Company has historically experienced, and expects to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations, with a larger percentage of its net sales and operating profit being realized in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, the Companys quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores, the timing of television and circular advertising, and the timing of certain holidays. The Company purchases substantial amounts of inventory and incurs higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit by fiscal quarter: First Second Third Fourth Fiscal Year 2004 Net sales percentage of full year 23.3 % 22.7 % 22.4 % 31.6 % Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year restated (a) 20.1 (12.2 ) (40.0 ) 132.1 Fiscal Year 2003 Net sales percentage of full year 22.7 % 22.8 % 22.7 % 31.8 % Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year restated 16.0 (7.7 ) (4.1 ) 95.8 Fiscal Year 2002 Net sales percentage of full year 23.4 % 22.7 % 22.4 % 31.5 % Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year restated 17.0 6.8 (2.4 ) 78.6  (a) The first, second, and third quarters of fiscal year 2004 are restated for certain lease accounting corrections. 15 Store Remodels and Conversions In conjunction with the Companys initiative to change its name to Big Lots and operate under one brand name, approximately 430 stores were remodeled during fiscal years 2001 and 2002, including 380 stores previously operating under the names Odd Lots, MacFrugals, and Pic N Save, and 54 existing Big Lots stores located in conversion markets. As of the end of fiscal year 2002, all stores were operating under the Big Lots name. The Company believes that Big Lots is its most recognizable brand name, and this change offers numerous opportunities to increase brand awareness among customers, suppliers, investors, and the general public. The Company believes the conversion also allows it to efficiently leverage a single brand name through television advertising and other advertising programs. In connection with this conversion and remodeling process, the Company made certain improvements to the converted sites. The improvements varied by location and included, among other things, painting, lighting retrofits, new signage (interior and exterior) and advertising, new flooring, and updated restrooms. In fiscal year 2003, the Company remodeled 211 stores. These remodels included similar improvements and, in addition, included new fixtures and a new merchandise layout. In fiscal year 2004, the Company remodeled 66 stores in 12 markets. The Company also added a closeout swing area to another 74 stores. The closeout swing area is located at the front of the store and features the newest and most compelling brand name closeout merchandise the store has to offer. The selection can vary by store, and items normally only last about a week before selling out or moving to their natural location in the store. In the last four years, the Company has remodeled over 700 stores. Based on the number of stores remodeled in the last four years, the Company estimates approximately 75% of its stores have either been remodeled or opened as new stores in the last six years. The average cost of the improvements for converted and remodeled stores was approximately $0.1 million per store during fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Furniture and Distribution Facility Growth During fiscal year 2004, the Company added 224 furniture departments (net of closed departments), ranging in size from 2,000 to 5,000 square feet. The furniture category has grown over the last nine years to a level representing 12.5% of the Companys net sales in fiscal year 2004 compared to 12.1% in fiscal year 2003. The Company operated 1,069 furniture departments within existing closeout stores at the end of fiscal year 2004, in addition to 43 freestanding furniture stores. In an effort to expand the Companys furniture presence, the Redlands DC was opened in fiscal year 2004. This facility began shipping merchandise in September 2004 to approximately 300 stores principally in the western regions of the country. The majority of these stores support approximately 700 selling square feet of furniture with a limited merchandise assortment consisting principally of ready to assemble furniture, futons, and lamps. With the expansion of furniture departments in the West and a selection of ready to assemble furniture in 295 stores, the Company offered a furniture assortment in 1,364 of its 1,459 closeout stores as of the end of fiscal year 2004. Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements In light of views expressed by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC on February 7, 2005, the Company reviewed its accounting practices for operating leases. Under the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Technical Bulletin 85 3, Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases, rent expense should be amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. In prior periods, the Company had determined that the term of the lease began on the earlier of the commencement date of the lease or the store opening date, rather than at the time the Company took physical possession of the property to start construction of leasehold improvements. This had the effect of excluding the construction period of the stores from the straight line rent calculation. The Company has corrected its accounting policy to begin the lease term at the possession date. The Company has restated its previously reported financial statements to correct its accounting to include construction periods in store operating leases. 16 In addition, under FASB Technical Bulletin 88 1, Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases, lease incentives such as tenant allowances received from the landlord to cover construction costs incurred by the Company should be reflected as a deferred liability, amortized over the term of the lease and reflected as a reduction to rent expense. The Company had previously classified tenant allowances as a reduction to property and equipment instead of as a deferred lease credit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, the Company also amortized the deferred lease credit over the asset life instead of over the lease term and reflected the amortization as a reduction to depreciation expense instead of as a reduction to rent expense and reflected tenant allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within investing activities instead of a change in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company reassessed this accounting policy and has corrected its accounting policy to treat lease incentives received as a deferred liability amortized over the lease term. The Company has also restated the previously reported Consolidated Financial Statements to properly account for tenant allowances. Subsequent to the issuance of the Companys fiscal 2003 financial statements, the Companys management determined that investments in certain mutual funds and company stock associated with a non qualified deferred compensation plan were incorrectly presented as cash instead of non current assets and treasury stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Furthermore, the corresponding deferred compensation liability was incorrectly presented as a current liability instead of a non current liability and the acquisition of treasury stock was incorrectly presented as a component of operating activity instead of financing activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company evaluated the materiality of these corrections on its financial statements and concluded that the incremental impact of these corrections is not material to any quarterly or annual period; however, the cumulative effect of these corrections is material to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004. As a result, the Company has recorded the cumulative effect as of fiscal year 2000, and has restated the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 31, 2004, and the Consolidated Statements of Operations, Shareholders Equity and Cash Flows for the years ended January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003 in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company has restated the quarterly financial information for fiscal year 2002, fiscal year 2003, and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004 included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company has restated the applicable financial information for fiscal years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 in Item 6 Selected Financial Data. The Company did not amend its previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10 K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q for the restatement, and the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K all referenced amounts for prior periods and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis. The restatement primarily resulted in a decrease to net income of $1.0 million and $0.8 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. The restatement did not impact income (loss) from discontinued operations and the related per common share calculations. The cumulative effect of these accounting corrections reduced retained earnings by $2.8 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2002. Additionally, the restatement resulted in an increase in cash flows provided by operating activities of $3.9 million and $7.1 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, the restatement resulted in an increase in cash used in investing activities of $6.5 million and $7.4 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note 2 (Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of the effects of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements. This Managements Discussion and Analysis gives effect to these corrections. Investments in auction rate preferred securities and municipal auction rate securities (collectively, auction rate securities) have been reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 31, 2004. This reclassification was made because the auction rate securities had stated maturities beyond three months. The amount of auction rate securities included in short term investments was $7.5 million at January 31, 2004. There were no auction rate securities at January 29, 2005. The auction rate securities reclassification resulted in an increase of purchases of short term investments and an increase of net cash used in investing activities of $7.5 million in the fiscal year 2003 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The auction rate securities resulted in an increase of $115.1 million in purchases of short term investments and an increase of $122.6 million in the redemption of short term investments in the fiscal year 2004 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The reclassifications had no impact on the Companys results of operations or financial condition. 17 The Companys inventory of maintenance parts and certain deposits aggregating $6.1 million have been reclassified from other current assets to other long term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 31, 2004, to reflect the expected use of those assets. Self insurance reserves in the amount of $38.2 million have been reclassified from accrued liabilities to other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 31, 2004, to reflect the projected timing of payments. Deferred income tax assets of $13.1 million related to these reclassifications have been reclassified from current assets to long term assets on the Consolidated Balanced Sheet at January 31, 2004. KB Toys Matters On January 14, 2004, KB Acquisition Corporation and certain affiliated entities (collectively, KB) filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code. KB acquired the KB Toys business from the Company pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2000 (the KB Stock Purchase Agreement). The Company analyzed the information currently available regarding the effect of KBs bankruptcy filing on the various continuing rights and obligations of the parties to the KB Stock Purchase Agreement, including: a) an outstanding note from Havens Corners Corporation, a subsidiary of KB Acquisition Corporation and a party to the bankruptcy proceedings (HCC), to the Company, and an accompanying warrant to acquire common stock of KB Holdings, Inc., the ultimate parent of KB and a party to the bankruptcy proceedings (KB Holdings); b) the status of KBs indemnification obligations to the Company with respect to guarantees of KB store leases by the Company and guarantees (relating to lease and mortgage obligations) for which the Company has indemnification obligations arising out of its 1996 acquisition of the KB Toys business from Melville Corporation (now known as CVS New York, Inc., and together with its subsidiaries CVS); and c) the status of the Companys and KBs other indemnification obligations to each other with respect to general liability claims, representations and warranties, litigation, taxes, and other payment obligations pursuant to the KB Stock Purchase Agreement. When and to the extent the Company believes that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability. The Company recorded a $3.7 million charge (net of tax) in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 associated with the estimated impact of the KB bankruptcy, which was comprised of a $10.6 million benefit (net of tax) related to the partial charge off of the HCC Note and KB Warrant (as each is defined below) and a $14.3 million charge (net of tax) related to KB guarantee obligations. As discussed below, the Company recorded an additional $6.6 million charge (net of tax) in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 related to the estimated impact of additional guarantee obligations resulting from the KB bankruptcy. In connection with the sale of the KB Toys business, the Company received $258.0 million in cash and a 10 year note from HCC in the aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million. This note bears interest, on an in kind basis, at the rate of 8.0% per annum (principal and interest together known as the HCC Note). The Company also received a warrant to acquire up to 2.5% of the common stock of KB Holdings for a stated price per share (KB Warrant). At the time of the sale (the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000), the Company evaluated the fair value of the HCC Note received as consideration in the transaction and recorded the HCC Note at its then estimated fair value of $13.2 million. The estimated fair value of the HCC Note was based on several factors, including fair market evaluations obtained from independent financial advisors at the time of the sale, the Companys knowledge of the underlying KB Toys business and industry, and the risks inherent in receiving no cash payments until the HCC Note matured in 2010. During fiscal year 2002 and until KBs bankruptcy filing, the Company recorded the interest earned and accretion of the discount utilizing the effective interest rate method and provided necessary reserves against such amounts as a result of its evaluations of the carrying value of the HCC Note. As of February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, the carrying value of the HCC Note was $16.1 million. For tax purposes, the HCC Note was originally recorded at its face value of $45.0 million, and the Company incurred tax liability on the interest, which was accrued but was not payable. This resulted in the HCC Note having a tax basis that was greater than the carrying value on the Companys books. The HCC Note became immediately due and payable at the time of KBs bankruptcy filing. The Company engaged an independent investment advisory firm to assist the Company in estimating the fair value of the 18 HCC Note and KB Warrant for both book and tax purposes. As a result, the Company charged off a portion of the HCC Note and wrote down the full value of the KB Warrant resulting in a book value of the HCC Note of $7.3 million, and accordingly recorded a net charge (before tax) to continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 in the amount of $9.6 million. In addition, as a result of the bankruptcy filing and the partial charge off, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $20.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003. A substantial portion of this tax benefit reflects the charge off of the higher tax basis of the HCC Note. The book value of the HCC Note was $7.3 million at January 29, 2005, and January 31, 2004. The HCC Note is recorded as a component of long term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at January 29, 2005, and January 31, 2004. When the Company acquired the KB Toys business from CVS in May 1996, the Company provided, among other things, an indemnity to CVS with respect to any losses resulting from KBs failure to pay all monies due and owing under any KB lease or mortgage obligation guaranteed by CVS. The typical form of the CVS guarantee provides that the terms of the underlying lease may be extended, amended, modified or in any way changed without the consent of the guarantor. While the Company controlled the KB Toys business, the Company provided guarantees containing terms similar to the CVS guarantees with respect to a limited number of additional store leases. As part of the KB sale, and in accordance with the terms of the KB Stock Purchase Agreement, KB similarly agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to all lease and mortgage obligations, including those guaranteed by CVS and those guaranteed by the Company. To the Companys knowledge, the Company has guarantee or indemnification obligations, as of January 29, 2005, with respect to: a) approximately 390 KB store leases; b) two distribution center leases; c) KBs main office building lease; and d) a first mortgage on a distribution center located in Pittsfield, Massachusetts (the Pittsfield DC). In connection with the bankruptcy, KB is generally required to continue to make lease payments with respect to all non residential real estate leases until the bankruptcy court approves KBs decision to reject a lease and KB vacates the leased premises that it rejects. If KB rejects a lease that has been guaranteed by the Company or by CVS, because KB can reject its indemnification obligations to the Company, the Company could be liable for all or a portion of the lease obligations with respect to the rejected leases, subject to many factors, including the landlords duty to mitigate, and the validity of the applicable guarantee. On February 25, 2004, the Company announced that KB had rejected 389 store leases, of which the Company believes it has guarantee or indemnification obligations relating to approximately 90. The Company engaged an independent real estate valuation firm to assist in the analysis of the Companys potential liability with respect to the 90 guaranteed leases. Based upon analysis of the information then available, the Company recorded a charge to discontinued operations for rent and legal expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 in the amount of $14.3 million (net after a $9.7 million tax benefit) to reflect its best estimate of this loss contingency. On October 26, 2004, KB announced its intent to close an additional 141 to 238 underperforming stores and reject those leases by January 31, 2005. At October 30, 2004, the Company believed that KB had rejected approximately 598 store leases and that the Company has guarantee or indemnification obligations relating to approximately 162 of those leases (including 72 resulting from KBs October 26, 2004, announcement). Using the same methodology to analyze the Companys potential liability with respect to these additional guaranteed leases, the Company recorded a charge to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 in the amount of $4.9 million (net after a $3.7 million tax benefit) to reflect its best estimate of this loss contingency. Since October 30, 2004, the Company believes that KB has both rejected a limited number of additional store leases and withdrew its previous rejection of certain other store leases. KBs actions have resulted in a net increase of approximately 5 store lease rejections (bringing the total rejections to approximately 167), for which the Company believes it has guarantee or indemnification obligations. No additional charges related to the guarantee obligations have been recorded by the Company since October 30, 2004. On March 10, 2004, the Company announced that it had received notice of a default relating to a first mortgage on the Pittsfield DC. As a result of KBs bankruptcy filing, the mortgage holder declared an event of default and claimed that the loan had become immediately due and payable (the Pittsfield DC Note). The Company was informed that, as of January 14, 2004, the Pittsfield DC Note had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $6.3 million plus accrued interest of approximately $21,000. Additionally, the mortgage holder claimed that a make whole premium of approximately $1.5 million was also due and 19 payable. On November 5, 2004, the Company satisfied its indemnity obligation with respect to the Pittsfield DC Note at a cost of $8.4 million. The Company engaged an independent real estate valuation firm to assist it in the analysis of the Companys potential loss arising from the indemnification payment related to the Pittsfield DC Note. Based upon analysis of the information then available, the Company recorded a charge to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 in the amount of $1.7 million (net after a $1.0 million tax benefit) to reflect its best estimate of the difference between the subrogation rights ($6.1 million) flowing from the indemnification payment and the net realizable value of the Pittsfield DC. The Company intends to take an active role in limiting its potential liability with respect to KB store lease obligations and the Pittsfield DC Note. The Company is not aware of any additional rejections of the remaining store leases guaranteed by the Company, or a rejection of the two distribution center leases or the lease on KBs main office building. It is the Companys belief that both distribution centers have been sublet by KB to unaffiliated third parties and that KB intends to retain the lease on its main office building. In its October 26, 2004, announcement, KB stated that it believed this would be the final round of store closings before its emergence from bankruptcy. Nevertheless, due to the nature of the KB bankruptcy, the Company is unable to determine at this time whether any additional liability will result from the remaining leases guaranteed by the Company or CVS that have not yet been rejected by KB. Moreover, since the typical form of guarantee permits an extension, amendment, modification or other change, the Company is unable to estimate its maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, required to satisfy lease guarantees. In the event additional leases are rejected, any related charge would be to discontinued operations. Management does not believe that such a charge would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of continuing operations, or liquidity. In addition to including KBs indemnity of the Company with respect to lease and mortgage obligations, the KB Stock Purchase Agreement contains mutual indemnifications of KB by the Company and of the Company by KB. These indemnifications relate primarily to losses arising out of general liability claims, breached or inaccurate representations or warranties, shared litigation expenses, other payment obligations, and taxes. Under a tax indemnification provision in the KB Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company is to indemnify KB for tax losses generally related to the periods prior to the Companys sale of KB. The Company continues to assess the effect of the KB bankruptcy on such mutual indemnification obligations and has not made any provision for loss contingencies with respect to any non lease or non tax related indemnification obligations. At this time, management does not believe that such a charge would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of continuing operations, or liquidity. The following are the components of discontinued operations: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Loss on disposal of KB Toys business, net of income tax benefit of $4,672, $14,691, and $4,000 in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. $(6,648) $(9,720) $ During fiscal year 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys consolidated income tax returns for the fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000 cycle. The consolidated income tax returns for that cycle included the KB Toys business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, the fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000 IRS examination cycle was substantially resolved when the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found no exception to the IRS field examination report (for further discussion, refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The Company has also received substantial resolution with the Appeals Division of the IRS related to a KB income tax matter for fiscal year 1996 in conjunction with the MacFrugals Bargains Close outs, Inc. appeal (for further discussion, refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Discontinued operations also reflect the substantial resolution and closure of tax audit activity, the closing of the statute of limitations, and changes in the expected outcome of tax contingencies related to KB state and local non income tax matters. As a result of the substantial resolution and closure of these items, the Company has reversed previously accrued income 20 taxes of approximately $4.7 million, and sales and use taxes of approximately $1.1 million related to discontinued operations in fiscal year 2003. On February 9, 2005, the Company commenced a suit in the Delaware Chancery Court against certain of the officers, directors and shareholders of KB alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy. On March 3, 2005, the United States Bankruptcy Court District of Delaware, finding that litigating the state court action would distract KBs management and thereby hinder its ability to focus on a successful reorganization, temporarily enjoined the Companys suit until July 15, 2005, assuming KB or the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors propose a confirmable plan of reorganization by May 15, 2005. The Company intends to vigorously prosecute this action to recover its damages arising from defendants actions resulting in KBs inability to satisfy the HCC Note. Fiscal Year 2004 Compared To Fiscal Year 2003 Net Sales Net sales increased 4.8% to $4,375.1 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $4,174.4 million in fiscal year 2003. The Company attributes this increase principally to new store growth as comparable store sales were flat for fiscal year 2004. Comparable store sales for fiscal year 2004 were calculated using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of fiscal year 2004. Comparable store sales consisted of a 2.0% increase in the value of the average basket driven by strong gains in hardlines and home d&eacute;cor departments, as well as the addition of 224 new furniture departments. Average basket gains were offset by a 2.0% decrease in the number of customer transactions, which the Company believes was principally the result of the impact that macro economic pressure of higher prices for gas, home heating oil, and other commodities had on the Companys core customer which has an estimated average household income of $40,000. The Company believes that future sales growth is dependent upon an increase in the number of customer transactions as well as an increase in the dollar value of the average basket. The following table summarizes comparable store sales, customer transactions, and the value of the average basket for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 Comparable store sales 0.0 % 3.4 % Customer transactions (2.0 )% 1.7 % Value of the average basket 2.0 % 1.7 % Net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales, and the net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 were as follows: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,301,515 29.7 % $ 1,251,651 30.0 % $ 49,864 4.0 % Home 1,244,028 28.4 1,139,887 27.3 104,141 9.1 Seasonal and toys 852,967 19.5 859,597 20.6 (6,630 ) (0.8 ) Other 976,562 22.4 923,248 22.1 53,314 5.8 Net sales $ 4,375,072 100.0 % $ 4,174,383 100.0 % $ 200,689 4.8 % The Home category includes furniture, domestics, and home d&eacute;cor departments. The Other category primarily includes electronics, apparel, home maintenance, small appliances, and tools. The Company internally evaluates and externally communicates overall sales and merchandise performance based on these key merchandising categories and believes that these categories facilitate analysis of the Companys financial performance. Gross Profit Gross profit increased 1.8% to $1,777.4 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $1,746.4 million in fiscal year 2003. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 40.6% in fiscal year 2004 compared to 41.8% in fiscal 21 year 2003. This gross profit rate decline of 120 basis points was primarily due to lower sales in higher margin merchandise, such as seasonal and toys, an increased markdown rate due to a flat comparable store sales and the need for additional markdowns on seasonally sensitive categories, giftable items with low sell through rates, and selected discontinued styles in furniture. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 5.4% to $1,605.7 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $1,523.9 million in fiscal year 2003. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 36.7% in fiscal year 2004 compared to 36.5% in fiscal year 2003. Selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year 2003 primarily due to an increase in the number of stores, costs associated with higher levels of sales, and increased carton volume. The $81.8 million increase was primarily attributable to increased store payroll costs of $24.1 million, increased distribution and transportation costs of $20.1 million, and increased store occupancy related costs including rent and utilities of $27.3 million. Outbound distribution and transportation costs, which were included in selling and administrative expenses (refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K), increased 9.6% to $229.8 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $209.7 million in fiscal year 2003. Outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 5.3% in fiscal year 2004 compared to 5.0% in fiscal year 2003. The 30 basis point increase was primarily due to the de leveraging impact of the Durant DC in its first year, rising fuel rates, and increased one way carrier rates as a result of the revised driver hours of service regulations. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense for fiscal year 2004 was $104.2 million compared to $93.7 million for fiscal year 2003. The $10.5 million increase was principally related to new store growth, store remodels, and the opening of the Durant DC during the first quarter of 2004. Interest Expense Interest expense, including the amortization of obligation issuance costs, increased 51.2% to $24.8 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $16.4 million in fiscal year 2003. The $8.4 million increase in interest expense was due to the $8.9 million debt prepayment charge incurred in connection with the early termination of the Senior Notes and the $300.0 million secured revolving credit agreement entered in 2001 (the 2001 Credit Agreement). This prepayment charge was incurred in order to replace the Senior Notes, which carried a weighted average yield of 8.2%, with the variable rate 2004 Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate of the outstanding loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement at January 29, 2005, was 3.2%. Interest Income Interest income was $0.6 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $1.1 million for fiscal year 2003. Interest income was generated by interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investments. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate of the continuing operations of the Company was 29.8% for fiscal year 2004 compared to 20.7% for fiscal year 2003. The rate was substantially lower in fiscal year 2003 because of the reversal in fiscal year 2003 of a $15.0 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the partial charge off of the HCC Note. The Company anticipates the fiscal year 2005 effective income tax rate to fall within a range of 35.6% to 38.6%. The fiscal year 2005 estimate does not reflect the effect of 2005 state income tax legislation recently passed (or likely to soon be passed) as the Company is in the process of analyzing the full impact of the new legislation. In November 2003, the Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Ruling 2003 112 which clarified the definition of eligible employees for purposes of the Welfare to Work and Work Opportunity tax credits. 22 During the third quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Company filed protective refund claims for its fiscal years 1994 through 2000 based on this ruling. Claims for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 will be filed at a later date but prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Because of the contingent nature of this claim, no tax benefit has been recorded for this item. Discontinued Operations For a discussion of the discontinued operations, refer to Note 3 (KB Toys Matters) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal Year 2003 Compared To Fiscal Year 2002 Net Sales Net sales for fiscal year 2003 increased 7.9% to $4,174.4 million compared to net sales of $3,868.6 million for fiscal year 2002. This increase resulted from a comparable store sales increase of 3.4%, with the remaining increase driven primarily by sales from stores opened on or after February 4, 2001, offset by store closings. Comparable store sales for fiscal year 2003 were calculated using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of fiscal year 2003. The Company attributes its comparable store sales increase of 3.4% to an increase in the dollar value of the average basket of 1.7% and an increase in the number of customer transactions of 1.7%. The Company believes the increase in the number of customer transactions and the increase in the dollar value of the average basket for fiscal year 2003 resulted from several factors such as the launch of the Companys first national television advertising campaign covering all 1,430 stores, more productive advertising circulars, the introduction of furniture departments in 157 stores over the prior year, the allocation of additional square footage to 242 furniture departments in existing closeout stores, and improved in stock levels on everyday basic items. In terms of product categories, sales growth in fiscal year 2003 was broad based with positive comparable store sales increases across most major categories driven by gains in consumables, furniture, hardlines, and domestics, offset by declines in apparel and home d&eacute;cor. The following table summarizes comparable store sales, customer transactions, and the value of the average basket for fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002: Fiscal Year 2003 2002 Comparable store sales 3.4 % 7.7 % Customer transactions 1.7 % 2.8 % Value of the average basket 1.7 % 4.9 % Net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales, and the net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 were as follows: Fiscal Year 2003 2002 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,251,651 30.0 % $ 1,097,401 28.4 % $ 154,250 14.1 % Home 1,139,887 27.3 1,061,972 27.5 77,915 7.3 Seasonal and toys 859,597 20.6 822,425 21.3 37,172 4.5 Other 923,248 22.1 886,752 22.8 36,496 4.1 Net sales $ 4,174,383 100.0 % $ 3,868,550 100.0 % $ 305,833 7.9 % Gross Profit Gross profit increased $114.5 million, or 7.0%, in fiscal year 2003 to $1,746.4 million from $1,631.9 million in fiscal year 2002. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 41.8% in fiscal year 2003 compared to 23 42.2% in the previous year. The Company believes the 40 basis point decrease in the gross profit percentage was driven by a reduction of 60 basis points in the initial markup of merchandise due to a combination of better than expected sales in lower markup categories, such as consumables, and increased freight rates related to imported merchandise. Markdown reductions of 20 basis points over the previous year partially offset the decline in initial markup. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $122.9 million, or 8.8%, in fiscal year 2003 to $1,523.9 million from $1,401.0 million in fiscal year 2002. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 30 basis points to 36.5% in fiscal year 2003 from 36.2% in fiscal year 2002. The 30 basis point increase in the selling and administrative expense rate was primarily attributable to a partial charge off (23 basis points) of the HCC Note and the write off of the KB warrant received at the time of the sale of the KB Toys business and a charge (22 basis points) to settle California wage and hour lawsuits (for a further discussion, refer to Note 5 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Excluding these items, the selling and administrative expense rate reduction of 15 basis points was primarily attributable to the leveraging of fixed costs over a higher sales base and a reduced bonus payout, partially offset by the impact of increased outbound distribution and transportation costs and store payroll due to increased carton volume in departments such as consumables which experienced higher sales volume and declining carton values. Selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year 2002 primarily due to an increase in the number of stores; costs associated with higher levels of sales and increased carton volume; national advertising costs; a partial charge off of the HCC Note and the write off of the KB warrant; and litigation charges. The $122.9 million increase was primarily attributable to increased store payroll costs of $50.0 million, increased outbound distribution and transportation costs of $22.8 million, increased store occupancy related costs, including rent and utilities of $21.3 million, a $9.9 million increase in advertising costs, a $9.6 million partial charge off of the HCC Note and the write off of the KB warrant; and a $9.1 million charge for California wage and hour lawsuits. Outbound distribution and transportation costs, which were included in selling and administrative expenses (refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K), increased 12.2% to $209.7 million in fiscal year 2003 compared to $186.9 million in fiscal year 2002. Outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 5.0% in fiscal year 2003 compared to 4.8% in fiscal year 2002. The increase in dollars and rate was principally due to an increase in the number of cartons shipped. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense for fiscal year 2003 was $93.7 million compared to $85.7 million for fiscal year 2002. The $8.0 million increase was due to increased capital spending principally related to new store growth and remodeling of existing stores. Interest Expense Interest expense, including the amortization of debt issuance costs, was $16.4 million for fiscal year 2003 compared to $21.0 million for fiscal year 2002. As a percentage of net sales, interest expense decreased 10 basis points from 0.5% in fiscal year 2002 to 0.4% in fiscal year 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the fiscal year 2003 capitalization of $3.7 million of interest related to construction costs for the Durant DC. Interest expense for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 was primarily related to the Senior Notes with maturities ranging from four to six years as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs (for a discussion of these costs, refer to Note 4 (Long Term Obligations) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). 24 Interest Income Interest income increased slightly to $1.1 million in fiscal year 2003 compared to $0.8 million for fiscal year 2002. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate of the continuing operations of the Company was 20.7% for fiscal year 2003 compared to 39.5% for fiscal year 2002. The rate decrease was primarily related to the reversal in fiscal year 2003 of a $15.0 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the partial charge off of the HCC Note and the reversal of $3.1 million of previously accrued federal and state taxes as the result of the substantial resolution and closure of several years of federal and state income tax examinations. Discontinued Operations For a discussion of the discontinued operations, refer to Note 3 (KB Toys Matters) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital Resources On October 29, 2004, the Company paid all outstanding amounts and terminated all commitments related to the Senior Notes, and repaid all amounts outstanding and terminated all commitments under the 2001 Credit Agreement. Due to the early termination of the Senior Notes and the 2001 Credit Agreement, fiscal year 2004 interest expense included debt prepayment charges of $8.9 million. The Senior Notes carried a weighted average yield of 8.2% at the time of termination and ranked pari passu with the 2001 Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes and 2001 Credit Agreement were collateralized by inventories. All security interests in the collateral were released when the Senior Notes and 2001 Credit Agreement were terminated. Also on October 29, 2004, the Company entered into the 2004 Credit Agreement. The 2004 Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on October 28, 2009. The proceeds of the 2004 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain indebtedness of the Company, including amounts due under the 2001 Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes. The pricing and fees related to the 2004 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on the Companys debt rating. Loans made under the 2004 Credit Agreement may be prepaid by the Company without penalty. The 2004 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the 2004 Credit Agreement, which would permit the lenders to restrict the Companys ability to further access the 2004 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit, and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants at January 29, 2005. The 2004 Credit Agreement permits, at the Companys option, borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or London InterBank Offering Rate plus applicable margin. The 2004 Credit Agreement also permits, as applicable, borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by the Company and the lenders. The weighted average interest rate of the outstanding loans at January 29, 2005, was 3.2%. The Company typically repays and or borrows on a daily basis in accordance with the terms of the 2004 Credit Agreement. The daily activity is a net result of the Companys liquidity position, which is affected by: a) cash inflows such as store cash and other miscellaneous deposits; and b) cash outflows such as check clearings, wire and other electronic transactions, and other miscellaneous disbursements. In addition to revolving credit loans, the 2004 Credit Agreement includes a $30.0 million swing loan sub limit, a $50.0 million bid loan sub limit, and a $150.0 million letter of credit sub limit. At January 29, 2005, the total borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement were $159.2 million, which total amount was comprised of $129.2 million in revolving credit loans, $30.0 million in swing loans, and no bid loans. The borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement principally reflect the Companys increased 25 purchases of merchandise during the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 and those amounts used to terminate the Senior Notes. The borrowings available under the 2004 Credit Agreement, after taking into account the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $56.2 million, were $284.6 million at January 29, 2005. The Company utilizes its credit facility primarily to manage ongoing and seasonal working capital. Due to the termination of the Senior Notes, the Company expects borrowings and letters of credit through the end of May 2005 to range between $180 million and $220 million. Given the seasonality of the Companys business, the amount of borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors, including the time of year and the Companys need to acquire merchandise inventory. Liquidity The primary sources of liquidity for the Company have been cash flows from operations and, as necessary, borrowings under the 2001 Credit Agreement or the 2004 Credit Agreement, as applicable. At January 29, 2005, working capital was $622.3 million. Cash flows from operating activities were $71.3 million during fiscal year 2004 and resulted primarily from net income of $23.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $102.0 million, partially offset by an increase in inventories of $65.4 million over fiscal year 2003. The $65.4 million increase in inventories was primarily a result of decreased customer traffic and opportunistic closeout purchases. Cash flows used in investing activities of $127.8 million in fiscal year 2004, $177.9 million in fiscal year 2003, and $104.2 million in fiscal year 2002 were primarily related to capital expenditures of $135.3 million, $170.2 million, and $110.1 million in each of the respective fiscal years. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2004 were primarily driven by the re engineering of the Columbus DC, remodeling of existing stores, and new store openings. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2003 were primarily driven by the construction of the Durant DC, remodeling of existing stores, and new store openings. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2002 were primarily driven by new store openings, investments in store remodels, and the commencement of the construction of the Durant DC. Capital expenditure requirements in fiscal year 2005 are anticipated to range between $80 million and $90 million focused on new store openings, completing the re engineering project in the Columbus DC, and normal maintenance needs of the Companys distribution network and fleet of over 1,500 existing stores. Cash flows used in financing activities were $115.0 million in fiscal year 2004. The $115.0 million related primarily to repayments of $1,493.0 million, offset by borrowings of $1,448.2 million. Of the total borrowings and repayments, $204.0 million and $153.3 million were attributable to the early termination of the Senior Notes and the 2001 Credit Agreement, respectively. The Company also used $75.0 million for the share repurchase program during the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. The remaining borrowings and repayments were a result of activity associated with daily cash needs of the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has, or, if necessary, has the ability to obtain adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures, development of new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments, or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on the Companys capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 26 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes payments due under the Companys contractual obligations at January 29, 2005: Payments Due by Period (1) Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years Total (In thousands) Long term debt obligations (2) $ $ $ 159,200 $ $ 159,200 Operating lease obligations (3) (4) 257,169 426,713 270,542 198,339 1,152,763 Purchase obligations (4) (5) 721,959 174,830 65,662 157,682 1,120,133 Total contractual obligations (6) $ 979,128 $ 601,543 $ 495,404 $ 356,021 $ 2,432,096  (1) The disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that the Company believes to be reasonable as of the date of this report. Those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate; consequently, the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that the Company ultimately incurs. Variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include, but are not limited to: the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration; fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation; the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by the Company as of the date of this report; fluctuations in third party fees, governmental charges or market rates that the Company is obligated to pay under contracts it has with certain vendors; and the exercise of renewal options under or the automatic renewal of contracts that provide for the same. (2) Long term debt obligations include total borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement, of which the total amount was comprised of $129.2 million in revolving credit loans, $30.0 million in swing loans, and no bid loans. Borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement are permitted under various interest rate options based on the prime rate or London InterBank Offering Rate plus applicable margin, as well as borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by the Company and the lenders. The Company also had outstanding letters of credit totaling $56.2 million at January 29, 2005. Approximately $46 million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and the Company does not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit; accordingly, they have been excluded from the preceding table. The remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in Purchase Obligations. The table assumes that the 2004 Credit Agreement is paid at maturity. For a further discussion, refer to Note 4 (Long Term Obligations) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (3) Operating lease obligations include, among other items, leases for the Companys retail stores, warehouse space, offices, and certain office equipment. The future minimum commitments for store, warehouse space, and office operating leases are $863.6 million. For a discussion of leases, refer to Note 8 (Leases) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Many of the store lease obligations require the Company to pay for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. The Company estimates that future obligations for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance are $266.1 million at January 29, 2005. The Company has made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for its contractual obligations relative to CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Those assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: extrapolation of historical data to estimate the Companys future obligations; calculation of the Companys obligations based on per square foot averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold; and assumptions related to certain increases over historical data where the Companys obligation is a prorated share of all lessees obligations within a particular property. The remaining $23.1 million relates primarily to the operating leases of certain office equipment with remaining terms of less than one year or a month to month basis. (4) For purposes of the operating lease and purchase obligation disclosures, the Company has assumed that it will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a 27 determinable expiration date, and the Company disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement of the Company and its vendor, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension. Where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term, the Company disclosed its minimum commitment under such obligation, such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term, due to the uncertainty of the length of the eventual term. (5) Purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for retail merchandise issued in the ordinary course of the Companys business that are valued at $448.8 million, the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of January 29, 2005. Purchase obligations also include a commitment for future inventory purchases totaling $307.3 million at January 29, 2005. While the Company is not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment, for purposes of this tabular disclosure, the Company has included the value of the purchases that it anticipates making during each of the reported periods, as purchases will count toward its fulfillment of the aggregate obligation. The remaining $364.0 million is primarily related to distribution and transportation commitments and future advertising services. (6) The obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities, guarantees, and indemnities related to KB Toys. For a discussion of the discontinued operations, refer to Note 3 (KB Toys Matters) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Companys accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP are also described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The items listed below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the Companys accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for managements judgment in the principles application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The Company has certain critical accounting policies and accounting estimates, which are described below. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price. Under the retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics, and is stated at its current retail selling value. Inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department. Cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity. The retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross profit. These assumptions are based on historical experience and current information. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, and seasonal trends. Permanent markdowns are recorded as a gross profit reduction in the period of managements decision to initiate price reductions with the intent not to return the price to regular retail. Promotional markdowns are recorded as a gross profit reduction in the period the merchandise is sold. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the fiscal year. Such estimates are based on experience and the most recent physical inventory results. 28 While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, the Company has loss prevention programs and policies that it believes will minimize shrinkage. Due to the nature of the Companys purchasing practices for closeout and deeply discounted merchandise, vendors and merchandise suppliers generally do not offer the Company incentives such as slotting fees, cooperative advertising allowances, buy down agreements, or other forms of rebates that could materially reduce its cost of sales. Property and Equipment Property and equipment for the Companys general office, stores, regional offices, information technology services, and outbound distribution and transportation services are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense are recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the lease term. The estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows: Land improvements 15 years Buildings and leasehold improvements 540 years Fixtures and equipment 515 years Transportation equipment 37 years Capitalized interest was $0.6 million, $3.7 million, and $0.1 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Impairment The Company has long lived assets that consist primarily of property and equipment. The Company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends. Impairment is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows. The Companys assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods. The Company estimates the fair value of its long lived assets using readily available market information for similar assets. Insurance Reserves The Company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical benefit claims, and the Company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit significant exposure in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. Such amounts are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account known trends and projections of future results. Actual claims experience can impact these calculations and, to the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from estimates, future earnings could be impacted and the impact could be material. Income Taxes The Companys income tax accounts reflect estimates of the outcome or settlement of various asserted and unasserted income tax contingencies including tax audits and administrative appeals. At any point in time, several tax years may be in various stages of audit or appeal or could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. This requires a periodic identification and evaluation of significant doubtful or controversial issues. The results of the audits, appeals, or expiration of the statute of limitations are reflected in the income tax accounts accordingly. The Company has generated deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized. 29 The effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income (loss) before income taxes, the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income (loss), changes in the income tax laws (which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year), changes in the expected outcome or settlement of an income tax contingency, changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance, and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates. Pension Liabilities Pension and other retirement benefits, including all relevant assumptions required by GAAP, are evaluated each year. Due to the technical nature of retirement accounting, outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations. Since there are many assumptions used to estimate future retirement benefits, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expense and obligations. Certain actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate and expected long term rate of return, have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic pension cost and the related benefit obligations. The Company reviews external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return. The Companys objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date. In making this estimate, the Company reviews rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits. This process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of Aa or better. The discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for fiscal year 2004 was 6.1%. A 0.5% increase in the discount rate would reduce the net periodic pension cost by $0.2 million. A 0.5% reduction in the discount rate would increase the net periodic pension cost by $0.4 million. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets, the Company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the current or anticipated future allocation of the pension portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 8.5% long term rate of return on assets for fiscal year 2004. A 1.0% increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease the net periodic pension cost by $0.4 million. A 1.0% decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase the net periodic pension cost by $0.4 million. Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is subject to various legal actions and claims. In connection with such actions and claims, the Company must make estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal counsel to assist in the estimating process; however, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be materially different from managements estimates and adjustments to income could be required. The assumptions used by management are based on the requirements of FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The Company will record, if material, a liability when it has determined that the occurrence of a loss contingency is probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated, and it will disclose the related facts in the notes to its financial statements. If the Company determines that the occurrence of a loss contingency is reasonably possible or that it is probable but the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company will, if material, disclose the nature of the loss contingency and the estimated range of possible loss or include a statement that no estimate of loss can be made. The Company makes these determinations in consultation with its attorneys. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise. All sales are net of discounts and returns and exclude sales tax. The reserve for retail merchandise returns is based on the Companys prior experience. Wholesale sales are recognized in accordance with the shipping terms agreed upon in the purchase order. Wholesale sales are predominantly recognized under FOB origin where title and risk of loss pass to the buyer when the merchandise leaves the Companys distribution facility. However, when the shipping terms are FOB destination, recognition of sales revenue is delayed until completion of delivery to the designated location. 30 The Company recognizes gift card sales revenue at the time of redemption. The liability for the gift cards is established for the cash value at the time of purchase. The liability for outstanding gift cards is recorded in accrued liabilities. The Company offers price hold contracts on selected furniture merchandise. Revenue for price hold contracts is recognized when the customer makes the final payment and takes possession of the merchandise. In the event that a sale is not consummated, liquidated damages are recorded as the lesser of: a) $25; b) 10% of the merchandise purchase price (exclusive of sales tax); or c) the amounts deposited by the customer. Cash paid by the customers is recorded in accrued liabilities. Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise (including related inbound freight to the Companys distribution centers, duties, and commissions), markdowns, and inventory shrinkage, net of cash discounts and rebates. The Company classifies outbound distribution and transportation costs as selling and administrative expenses. Due to this classification, the Companys gross profit rates may not be comparable to those of other retailers that include outbound distribution and transportation costs in cost of sales. Selling and Administrative Expenses The Company includes store expenses (such as payroll and occupancy costs), outbound distribution and transportation costs to the Companys stores, advertising, purchasing, insurance, and overhead costs in selling and administrative expenses. Selling and administrative expense rates may not be comparable to those of other retailers that include outbound distribution and transportation costs in cost of sales. Rent Expense Rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease. The Company recognizes minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred incentive rent. The Company also receives tenant allowances, which are recorded in deferred incentive rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. Deferred incentive rent is reflected in other liabilities. The Companys straight line rent expense calculation is consistent with GAAP as recently clarified by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC. Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception. These contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level. These amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Discontinued Operations The reserve for discontinued operations includes managements estimate of the Companys potential liability under its lease and mortgage obligations which have been rejected by KB as part of its bankruptcy proceeding. For a discussion of the discontinued operations, refer to Note 3 (KB Toys Matters) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments. This standard supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) requires the use of the fair value method and eliminates the Companys ability to account for share based compensation using the intrinsic method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which was 31 permitted under SFAS No. 123, as originally issued. This standard will apply to all awards granted, modified, cancelled, or repurchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this standard and will begin expensing stock options in fiscal year 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing. This standard provides clarification that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, this standard requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of abnormal. This standard is effective for the Company in fiscal year 2006. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Commitments For a discussion of commitments, refer to Note 3 (KB Toys Matters), Note 4 (Long term Obligations), Note 5 (Commitments and Contingencies), and Note 8 (Leases) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates associated with the 2004 Credit Agreement. The Company had no fixed rate long term debt at January 29, 2005. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity; however, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change. The Company does not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in interest rates would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company purchases approximately 30% of its product directly from overseas suppliers, all of which are purchased in U.S. dollars. 32
