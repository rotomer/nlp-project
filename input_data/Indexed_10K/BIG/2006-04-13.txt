ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related Notes. Please refer to Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Whats Important Now (WIN) Strategy In 2005, the Company initiated a strategic assessment of its operations. Specifically, the Company is focusing on opportunities for improved financial performance as a result of a continuing detailed analysis of real estate, operating expenses, and merchandising. This strategic assessment is resulting in specific initiatives collectively referred to by the Company as its WIN Strategy. We believe that the tactical plans for 2006 have been set. Fiscal year 2006 will also be a year of significant testing activity to help develop a long term strategic direction for the Company. The following is a discussion of these specific initiatives. Real Estate As part of the real estate analysis, on October 6, 2005, the Company announced its decision to close approximately 126 underperforming stores in addition to the 40 stores previously planned for closure in fiscal year 2005. The Company completed its evaluation of underperforming stores in the fourth quarter and, as a result, 174 stores were closed during fiscal year 2005. The Company does not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of each store after closure. To determine if cash flows of each closed store met the Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 144 criteria for reporting each store in discontinued operations, resulting in their elimination from ongoing operations, the Company evaluated a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including: proximity to remaining open stores, physical location within a metropolitan or non metropolitan area, and expected transferability of sales between open and closed stores. Based on these criteria, the Company determined that the results of 130 stores should be reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company has included in discontinued operations the net sales and associated costs which were directly related to and specifically identifiable in relation to these 130 stores. Certain costs such as general office, field operations, national advertising, fixed distribution costs, and interest expense were not allocated to discontinued operations because these costs were not specifically identifiable at the store level. The table below identifies the significant components of income (loss) from discontinued operations related to these closed stores for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net sales $ 215,154 $ 225,820 $ 231,730 Gross margin 74,109 90,299 95,829 Operating income (loss) (41,130 ) (1,662 ) 6,617 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (25,381 ) $ (1,021 ) $ 4,029 16 The Companys results of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 include pretax losses in the amount of $41.1 million as the result of the 130 stores reported in discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005, including $43.6 million of exit related pretax costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the reversal of pretax charges of $0.4 million associated with the KB Toys business and a pretax non cash impairment charge of $0.7 million and other related charges of $0.3 million associated with the reclassification of the Pittsfield DC as held for sale and the related write down of its carrying value to fair value less selling cost. The table below summarizes the type and amount of charges recorded as a result of the store closures and identifies remaining obligations as of January 28, 2006: Write down of Property,Inventory,and DeferredRent SeveranceandBenefits LeaseTerminationCosts Total (In thousands) Charges $ 19,600 $ 3,300 $ 20,700 $ 43,600 Payments (1,539 ) (2,499 ) (4,038 ) Non cash reductions (19,600 ) (19,600 ) Remaining Obligations at January 28, 2006 $ $ 1,761 $ 18,201 $ 19,962 Asset write downs include assets used in normal operations of retail stores and remaining unrecoverable net book values of fixtures, equipment, and signs. The inventory write downs above are specific to the markdowns associated with liquidation sales conducted at the closed stores, which qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment. The Company records markdowns throughout the year in the normal course of business. The markdowns associated with the liquidation sales are the only markdowns included in the table above. Future cash outlays related to store closure obligations are anticipated to be $10.3 million in fiscal year 2006, $5.2 million in fiscal year 2007, $3.1 million in fiscal year 2008, and $1.4 million thereafter. Operating Expenses The Companys review of its operating expenses resulted in personnel reductions in the general office, field operations, and distribution centers. Realignments of resources were made based on the store closings and lower expected store growth in the near term. Additionally, some redundancies between the closeout store operations and the furniture store operations were eliminated. Merchandising As part of a review of its merchandising strategy, the Company in fiscal year 2005: 1) closed its stand alone furniture stores; 2) executed a series of markdowns lowering in store inventory levels in certain categories and improving inventory turnover; and 3) exited the frozen food business. The Company is continuing to develop its merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per square foot and increasing gross margin dollars. The Company has performed customer research and found that brand names, treasure hunt, price, value and savings are most important to its customers. The Company has taken this research and is working with its existing vendors and developing relationships with new vendors to produce a merchandising plan for each category. Certain elements of these plans will be tested and executed in fiscal year 2006. The Company will monitor the results of these tests to modify future merchandising plans as necessary to achieve its goals. KB Toys and Pittsfield Distribution Center Update Although the KB Toys business emerged from bankruptcy in fiscal year 2005, the claims process associated with the bankruptcy remains open. As a result of uncertainties associated with the continuance of the bankruptcy claims process, the Company believes it is possible that it will continue to receive in fiscal year 2006 demands from landlords for guarantees related to the KB Lease Obligations. The Company is an unsecured creditor of the bankruptcy trust with respect to losses it has incurred in connection with KB Lease Obligations and is unable to estimate the timing or amount of any recovery it can expect to receive upon resolution of these claims. Accordingly, no recoveries related to the KB Toys bankruptcy have been recorded 17 by the Company. In addition, the typical KB Lease Obligation provides that the terms of the underlying lease may be extended, amended or modified without the consent of the guarantor. The Company has concluded that its reserve for the KB Lease Obligations is adequate at January 28, 2006. Based on the uncertainties related to the KB Lease Obligations, the Company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves as dictated by the facts and circumstances available to the Company at each future reporting period. In the event additional liability arises from future defaults on the KB Lease Obligations, any related charge would be to discontinued operations. In fiscal year 2005, the Company initiated plans to dispose of the Pittsfield DC, which was acquired by the Company as a result of an indemnification of a mortgage guarantee satisfied by the Company in fiscal year 2004. The property is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is actively being marketed by a reputable broker. The Company has no intention of using this property in its current operations. As a result, at January 28, 2006, the Pittsfield DC has been classified as held for sale, as defined by SFAS No. 144, and accordingly, its carrying value at January 28, 2006 has been adjusted to its estimated fair value less applicable selling costs, resulting in a pretax non cash impairment charge of $0.7 million and other related charges of $0.3 million included in loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005. As partial consideration for the sale of the KB Toys business, the Company received a 10 year note from Havens Corners Corporation (HCC), a subsidiary of KB Acquisition Corporation and a party to the bankruptcy proceedings, in the aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million (principal and interest together known as the HCC Note). Upon receipt of the HCC Note in fiscal year 2000, the Company evaluated its fair value and recorded it at an estimated fair value of $13.2 million. The note bears interest, on an in kind basis, at the rate of 8.0% per annum; however, the Company discontinued the accrual of interest on the HCC Note in fiscal year 2003 as a result of the KB Toys bankruptcy. Under the KB Toys bankruptcy plan, the Company expects to receive $0.9 million as satisfaction of the HCC Note. In fiscal year 2005, the Company partially charged off the HCC Note in the amount of $6.4 million in order to reflect a remaining balance receivable of $0.9 million. This partial charge off was reported in selling and administrative expenses. For a discussion of these matters and other matters related to the KB Toys business, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Amendment to the 2004 Credit Agreement On October 25, 2005, the Company and its lenders entered into an amendment to the 2004 Credit Agreement in order to eliminate the impact on the covenant calculations of the charges related to the store closing plan discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Share Repurchase Program On February 22, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of the Companys common shares. The Company expects the purchases to be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with such purchases to be completed within one year of the announcement. Common shares acquired through the repurchase program will be available for general corporate purposes. 18 Results of Operations The following table compares components of the consolidated statements of operations of the Company as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 60.9 59.3 58.1 Gross margin 39.1 40.7 41.9 Selling and administrative expenses 36.0 36.6 36.5 Depreciation expense 2.5 2.4 2.3 Operating profit 0.6 1.7 3.1 Interest expense 0.1 0.6 0.4 Interest income (0.0 ) (0.0 ) (0.0 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 0.5 1.1 2.7 Income tax expense 0.1 0.3 0.5 Income from continuing operations 0.4 0.8 2.2 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (0.6 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Net income (loss) (0.2 )% 0.6 % 2.0 % The Company has historically experienced, and expects to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations, with a larger percentage of its net sales and operating profit being realized in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, the Companys quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores, the timing of television and circular advertising, and the timing of certain holidays. The Company purchases substantial amounts of inventory and incurs higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit by fiscal quarter: First Second Third Fourth Fiscal Year 2005 Net sales percentage of full year 23.5 % 22.6 % 22.4 % 31.5 % Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year 46.6 (66.5 ) (113.7 ) 233.6 Fiscal Year 2004 Net sales percentage of full year 23.3 % 22.7 % 22.4 % 31.6 % Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year 18.3 (10.3 ) (35.8 ) 127.8 Furniture Growth During fiscal year 2005, the Company continued to add furniture departments ranging in size from 2,000 to 5,000 square feet to its closeout stores. The furniture department net sales have grown over the last ten years to a level representing 13.5% of the Companys net sales in fiscal year 2005 compared to 11.7% in fiscal year 2004 and 11.1% in fiscal year 2003. The Company offered a furniture assortment within 1,320 of its 1,401 existing closeout stores at the end of fiscal year 2005. Fiscal Year 2005 Compared To Fiscal Year 2004 Net Sales Net sales increased 6.8% to $4,429.9 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $4,149.3 million in fiscal year 2004. This increase is due to new stores opened in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and the comparable store sales increase of 1.8% for fiscal year 2005. Comparable store sales are calculated by the Company using all stores 19 that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of fiscal year 2005. This calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable stores sales based on other methods. Fiscal year 2005 comparable store sales were driven by a 4.6% increase in the value of the average basket partially offset by a 2.8% decline in customer transactions. Customer transactions, which declined 2.8%, continue to be challenging across the discount sector. From a merchandise perspective, Home, which includes furniture, was the best performing category. As part of the Companys merchandising initiatives, clearance markdowns, primarily in the fourth quarter, benefited net sales and comparable store sales and were initiated to reduce inventory levels on slower moving items or classifications. The following table summarizes comparable store sales, customer transactions, and the value of the average basket for fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 Comparable store sales 1.8 % 0.0 % Customer transactions (2.8 ) % (2.0 ) % Value of the average basket 4.6 % 2.0 % The Company internally evaluates and externally communicates overall sales and merchandise performance based on the following key merchandising categories and believes these categories facilitate analysis of the Companys financial performance. Net sales by product category, net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 were as follows: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,275,851 28.8 % $ 1,247,207 30.1 % $ 28,644 2.3 % Home 1,333,602 30.1 1,153,297 27.8 180,305 15.6 Seasonal and toys 830,526 18.7 814,661 19.6 15,865 1.9 Other 989,926 22.4 934,087 22.5 55,839 6.0 Net sales $ 4,429,905 100.0 % $ 4,149,252 100.0 % $ 280,653 6.8 % The Consumables category includes sales increases in plastics, paper, and food, partially offset by a decrease in health and beauty. The Home category includes strong performance in furniture and home decor. Seasonal and toys includes sales increases for lawn & garden and toys, partially offset by decreases in trim a tree and harvest. The Other category includes strong performances in electronics, home appliances, and tools. Gross Margin Gross margin dollars increased 2.6% to $1,731.7 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1,687.1 million in fiscal year 2004. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 39.1% in fiscal year 2005 compared to 40.7% in fiscal year 2004. This gross margin rate decline of 160 basis points was primarily due to clearance related markdowns, higher inbound freight costs, and certain initial markup related cost pressures such as higher resin based material costs. Inbound freight costs are higher as a result of higher fuel costs and transportation capacity constraints. The Company continues to develop its merchandising strategy focused on increasing gross margin dollars through improved buying decisions, better pricing strategies, and a focus on improving inventory turnover. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 5.1% to $1,596.1 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1,518.6 million in fiscal year 2004. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 36.0% in fiscal year 2005 compared to 36.6% in fiscal year 2004. Selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year 2004 primarily due to costs associated with higher levels of sales and increased carton volume. The $77.5 million increase was primarily attributable to 20 increased store payroll costs of $20.9 million, increased store occupancy related costs, including rent and utilities, of $23.0 million, increased general office costs of $11.7 million, the partial charge off of the HCC Note of $6.4 million, increased advertising costs of $6.0 million, and increased distribution and transportation costs of $5.1 million. The increase in general office is primarily resulting from an increase in wage and benefit related costs. Outbound distribution and transportation costs, which were included in selling and administrative expenses (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) increased 2.3% to $223.8 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $218.7 million in fiscal year 2004. Outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 5.1% in fiscal year 2005 compared to 5.3% in fiscal year 2004. The 20 basis point decrease was primarily due to improved efficiency at the distribution centers, particularly the Durant DC. In addition, productivity has improved at the Columbus DC after two years of re engineering efforts. Partially offsetting these cost savings were higher diesel fuel costs incurred on outbound freight and higher utility costs at the distribution centers. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense for fiscal year 2005 was $108.7 million compared to $99.4 million for fiscal year 2004. The $9.3 million increase was principally related to new store growth. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 74.6% to $6.3 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $24.8 million in fiscal year 2004. The $18.5 million decrease in interest expense was due to the $8.9 million debt prepayment charge incurred in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the repayment of the $204.0 million in senior notes privately placed in 2001 (the Senior Notes) and the retirement of the $300.0 million secured revolving credit agreement entered into in 2001 (the 2001 Credit Agreement), lower average borrowings in fiscal year 2005, and a lower effective interest rate in fiscal year 2005. The prepayment charge was incurred in order to replace the Senior Notes, which carried a weighted average yield of 8.2%, and the 2001 Credit Agreement with the variable rate 2004 Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate of the outstanding loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement at January 28, 2006, was 5.1%. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate of the continuing operations of the Company was 24.8% for fiscal year 2005 compared to 30.1% for fiscal year 2004. The rate was lower in fiscal year 2005 because of 1) proportionately larger jurisdictional losses in entities with higher marginal income tax rates; 2) the adjustment of loss contingencies to recognize the expiration of the statute of limitations; offset by 3) the write down of deferred income tax assets as a result of state tax law changes (including Ohio tax reform enacted in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005). The Company anticipates the fiscal year 2006 effective income tax rate to fall within a range of 36.0% to 40.0%. Discontinued Operations The Company recorded a pretax loss of $41.7 million from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 compared to a pretax loss of $13.0 million in fiscal year 2004. The Companys results of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 include pretax losses in the amount of $41.1 million as the result of 130 stores reported in discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 which include $43.6 million of exit related pretax costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the reversal of pretax charges of $0.4 million associated with the KB Toys business and pretax charges of $1.0 million associated with the reclassification of the Pittsfield DC as held for sale and the related write down of its carrying value to fair value less selling cost. The Companys discontinued operations in fiscal year 2004 relate to pretax losses in the amount of $1.7 million as the result of the 130 stores reported in discontinued operations and pretax charges of $11.3 million associated with the KB Toys business. 21 Fiscal Year 2004 Compared To Fiscal Year 2003 Net Sales Net sales increased 5.2% to $4,149.3 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $3,942.7 million in fiscal year 2003. The Company attributes this increase principally to new store growth as comparable store sales were flat for fiscal year 2004. Comparable store sales consisted of a 2.0% increase in the value of the average basket driven by strong gains in hardlines and home d&eacute;cor departments, as well as the addition of 224 new furniture departments. Average basket gains were offset by a 2.0% decrease in the number of customer transactions, which the Company believes was principally the result of the impact that macro economic pressure of higher prices for gas, home heating oil, and other commodities had on the Companys core customer. The following table summarizes comparable store sales, customer transactions, and the value of the average basket for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 Comparable store sales 0.0 % 3.4 % Customer transactions (2.0 ) % 1.7 % Value of the average basket 2.0 % 1.7 % Net sales by product category, net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales, and the net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 were as follows: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,247,207 30.1 % $ 1,196,414 30.3 % $ 50,793 4.2 % Home 1,153,297 27.8 1,046,617 26.6 106,680 10.2 Seasonal and toys 814,661 19.6 819,004 20.8 (4,343 ) (0.5 ) Other 934,087 22.5 880,618 22.3 53,469 6.1 Net sales $ 4,149,252 100.0 % $ 3,942,653 100.0 % $ 206,599 5.2 % The Consumables category includes sales increases in food, health and beauty, paper, and pet. The Home category includes strong performance in furniture, domestics, and stationery. Seasonal and toys includes sales weakness in holiday oriented departments partially offset by growth in toys and lawn & garden. The Other category includes sales increases in electronics, home appliances, and jewelry partially offset by a decrease in apparel. Gross Margin Gross margin dollars increased 2.2% to $1,687.1 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $1,650.5 million in fiscal year 2003. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 40.7% in fiscal year 2004 compared to 41.9% in fiscal year 2003. This gross margin rate decline of 120 basis points was primarily due to lower sales in higher margin merchandise, such as holiday oriented departments in Seasonal and toys, an increased markdown rate due to a flat comparable store sales and the need for additional markdowns on seasonally sensitive categories, giftable items with low sell through rates, and selected discontinued styles in furniture. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 5.5% to $1,518.6 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $1,439.4 million in fiscal year 2003. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 36.6% in fiscal year 2004 compared to 36.5% in fiscal year 2003. Selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year 2003 primarily due to an increase in the number of stores, costs associated with higher levels of sales, and increased carton volume. The $79.2 million increase was primarily attributable to increased store payroll costs of $23.5 million, increased distribution and 22 transportation costs of $19.9 million, and increased store occupancy related costs, including rent and utilities, of $26.2 million. Outbound distribution and transportation costs, which were included in selling and administrative expenses increased 10.0% to $218.7 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $198.8 million in fiscal year 2003. Outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 5.3% in fiscal year 2004 compared to 5.0% in fiscal year 2003. The 30 basis point increase was primarily due to the de leveraging impact of the Durant DC in its first year, rising fuel rates, and increased one way carrier rates as a result of the revised driver hours of service regulations. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense for fiscal year 2004 was $99.4 million compared to $89.0 million for fiscal year 2003. The $10.4 million increase was principally related to new store growth, store remodels, and the opening of the Durant DC during the first quarter of 2004. Interest Expense Interest expense, including the amortization of obligation issuance costs, increased 51.2% to $24.8 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $16.4 million in fiscal year 2003. The $8.4 million increase in interest expense was due to the $8.9 million debt prepayment charge incurred in connection with the early repayment of the Senior Notes and the 2001 Credit Agreement. This prepayment charge was incurred in order to replace the Senior Notes, which carried a weighted average yield of 8.2%, and the 2001 Credit Agreement with the variable rate 2004 Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement at January 29, 2005 was 3.2%. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate of the continuing operations of the Company was 30.1% for fiscal year 2004 compared to 19.5% for fiscal year 2003. The rate was substantially lower in fiscal year 2003 because of the reversal in fiscal year 2003 of a $15.0 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the partial charge off of the HCC Note. In November 2003, the Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Ruling 2003 112 which clarified the definition of eligible employees for purposes of the Welfare to Work and Work Opportunity tax credits. The Company has filed protective refund claims for its fiscal years 1994 through 2001 based on this ruling. Claims for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 will be filed at a later date but prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Because of the contingent nature of this claim, no tax benefit has been recorded for this item. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations resulted in a pretax loss of $13.0 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to a pretax loss of $17.8 million in fiscal year 2003. The Companys discontinued operations in fiscal year 2004 include pretax losses in the amount of $1.7 million for the results of 130 stores reported in discontinued operations and pretax charges of $11.3 million associated with the KB Toys business. The Companys discontinued operations in fiscal year 2003 include pretax income in the amount of $6.6 million for the results of the 130 stores reported in discontinued operations and pretax charges of $24.4 million associated with the KB Toys business. Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital Resources On October 29, 2004, the Company entered into the 2004 Credit Agreement which is scheduled to mature on October 28, 2009. The proceeds of the 2004 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain indebtedness of the Company, including all amounts that were outstanding under the 2001 Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes. The pricing and fees related to the 23 2004 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on the Companys debt rating. Loans made under the 2004 Credit Agreement may be prepaid by the Company without penalty. The 2004 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens, and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the 2004 Credit Agreement, which would permit the lenders to restrict the Companys ability to further access the 2004 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit, and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement. On October 25, 2005, the Company and the lenders entered into an amendment to the 2004 Credit Agreement in order to eliminate the impact on the covenant calculations of the charges related to the store closings discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company was in compliance with its amended financial covenants under the 2004 Credit Agreement at January 28, 2006. The 2004 Credit Agreement permits, at the Companys option, borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or London InterBank Offering Rate plus applicable margin. The 2004 Credit Agreement also permits, as applicable, borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by the Company and the lenders. The weighted average interest rate of the outstanding loans at January 28, 2006, was 5.1%. The Company typically repays and or borrows on a daily basis in accordance with the terms of the 2004 Credit Agreement. The daily activity is a net result of the Companys liquidity position, which is generally affected by: 1) cash inflows such as store cash and other miscellaneous deposits; and 2) cash outflows such as check clearings, wire and other electronic transactions, and other miscellaneous disbursements. In addition to revolving credit loans, the 2004 Credit Agreement includes a $30.0 million swing loan sub limit, a $50.0 million bid loan sub limit, and a $150.0 million letter of credit sub limit. At January 28, 2006, the total borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement were $5.5 million, all in swing loans. The borrowings available under the 2004 Credit Agreement, after taking into account the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $65.0 million, were $429.5 million at January 28, 2006. The Company utilizes its credit facility primarily to manage ongoing and seasonal working capital. Given the seasonality of the Companys business, the amount of borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors, including the time of year and the Companys need to acquire merchandise inventory. The Company anticipates borrowings and letters of credit through the end of May 2006 to range between $50.0 million and $75.0 million, excluding any impact resulting from the execution of the $150.0 million share repurchase authorized by the Board of Directors in February 2006. Liquidity The primary source of liquidity for the Company is cash flows from operations and, as necessary, borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement. At January 28, 2006, working capital was $557.2 million. Cash provided by operating activities was $213.0 million during fiscal year 2005 and resulted primarily from net loss of $(10.1) million, depreciation and amortization expense of $114.6 million and a decrease in net assets of $102.1 million over fiscal year 2004. The $102.1 million decrease in net assets was primarily a result of lower inventory of $58.9 million, higher accounts payable of $11.7 million, higher accrued operating expenses of $22.0 million, and higher other liabilities of $25.0 million. The reduction in inventory is primarily a result of fewer stores open at the end of fiscal year 2005 compared to prior year and the impact of the markdown clearance sales. The higher accrued operating expenses are primarily due to the increased current portion of lease obligation resulting from the closure of certain stores before their full lease term expired. The increase in other liabilities is primarily due to the non current portion of the lease obligation associated with the closed stores and an increase in the non current portion of insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liability. Cash provided by operating activities was $71.3 million during fiscal year 2004 and resulted primarily from net income of $23.8 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $101.9 million partially offset by an increase in net assets of $70.0 million. The impact of closing the underperforming stores and the series of markdowns taken on slower moving inventory had the effect of significantly strengthening the Companys balance sheet in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004. 24 Cash used in investing activities of $66.7 million in fiscal year 2005 and $127.8 million in fiscal year 2004 was primarily related to capital expenditures of $68.5 million and $135.3 million in each of the respective fiscal years. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2005 were primarily due to opening 73 new stores. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2004 were primarily driven by the re engineering of the Columbus DC, remodeling 66 existing stores, and opening 103 new stores. Capital expenditure requirements in fiscal year 2006 are anticipated to range between $50 million and $55 million, focused on maintaining existing property and equipment along with a limited number of new store openings and information technology enhancements. Cash used in financing activities was $147.1 million in fiscal year 2005 and related primarily to the net repayment of borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement. Cash used in financing activities was $115.0 million in fiscal year 2004 including net repayments of debt of $44.8 million and acquisition of treasury stock costing $75.0 million. The Company announced a share repurchase program of $150.0 million on February 22, 2006, which it expects to complete within one year of the announcement. The amount of the repurchase program was based in part on the level of cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2005. The Company continues to believe that it has, or, if necessary, has the ability to obtain adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments, or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on the Companys capital resources or liquidity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes payments due under the Companys contractual obligations at January 28, 2006: Payments Due by Period (1) Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years Total (In thousands) Long term debt obligations (2) $ $ $ 5,500 $ $ 5,500 Operating lease obligations (3) (4) 265,320 430,184 255,895 177,211 1,128,610 Purchase obligations (4) (5) 560,629 189,920 86,631 120,007 957,187 Total contractual obligations (6) $ 825,949 $ 620,104 $ 348,026 $ 297,218 $ 2,091,297  (1) The disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that the Company believes to be reasonable as of the date of this report. Those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate; consequently, the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that the Company ultimately incurs. Variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include, but are not limited to: the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration; fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation; the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by the Company as of the date of this report; fluctuations in third party fees, governmental charges or market rates that the Company is obligated to pay under contracts it has with certain vendors; and the exercise of renewal options under or the automatic renewal of contracts that provide for the same. (2) Long term debt obligations consist of the total borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement are permitted under various interest rate options based on the prime rate or London InterBank Offering Rate plus applicable margin, as well as borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by the Company and the lenders. The Company also had outstanding letters of credit totaling $65.0 million at January 28, 2006. Approximately $57.2 million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and the Company does not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit; accordingly, they have been excluded from the preceding table. The remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in Purchase Obligations. The table assumes that the 2004 Credit Agreement is paid at maturity. For a further discussion, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 25 (3) Operating lease obligations include, among other items, leases for the Companys retail stores, warehouse space, offices, and certain office equipment. The future minimum commitments for store, warehouse space, and office operating leases are $824.3 million. For a discussion of leases, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Many of the store lease obligations require the Company to pay for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. The Company estimates that future obligations for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance are $280.6 million at January 28, 2006. The Company has made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for its contractual obligations relative to CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Those assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: extrapolation of historical data to estimate the Companys future obligations; calculation of the Companys obligations based on per square foot averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold; and assumptions related to certain increases over historical data where the Companys obligation is a prorated share of all lessees obligations within a particular property. The remaining $23.7 million relates primarily to the operating leases of certain office equipment with remaining terms of less than one year or a month to month basis. (4) For purposes of the operating lease and purchase obligation disclosures, the Company has assumed that it will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date, and the Company disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement of the Company and its vendor, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension. Where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term, the Company disclosed its minimum commitment under such obligation, such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term, due to the uncertainty of the length of the eventual term. (5) Purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for retail merchandise issued in the ordinary course of the Companys business that are valued at $389.5 million, the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of January 28, 2006. Purchase obligations also include a commitment for future inventory purchases totaling $263.3 million at January 28, 2006. While the Company is not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment, for purposes of this tabular disclosure, the Company has included the value of the purchases that it anticipates making during each of the reported periods, as purchases will count toward its fulfillment of the aggregate obligation. The remaining $304.4 million is primarily related to distribution and transportation commitments. (6) The obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities, guarantees, and indemnities related to KB Toys. For further discussion, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 28, 2006, the Company has approximately 167 KB Lease Obligations. The relevant guarantees were issued prior to January 1, 2003, and are not subject to the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45. The typical KB Lease Obligation provides that the terms of the underlying lease may be extended, amended, or modified without the consent of the guarantor. As a result, the Company is unable to estimate any potential range of loss in the event of non performance or non performance by KB Toys, as applicable. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of KB Toys matters. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long lived assets, insurance reserves, income taxes, contingencies, leases, and pension. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 26 circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to reporting its results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the Companys accounting policies. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price. Under the average cost retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics, at its current retail selling value. Inventory retail selling values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department. Cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity. The average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross margin. These assumptions are based on historical experience and current information. Permanent markdowns are recorded as a gross margin reduction in the period of managements decision to initiate price reductions with the intent not to return the price to regular retail. Promotional markdowns are recorded as a gross margin reduction in the period the merchandise is sold. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, and seasonal trends. Shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories and gross margin and is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period. Such estimates are based on the Companys actual experience and the Companys most recent physical inventory results. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, the Company has loss prevention programs and policies that it believes minimize shrinkage. Long Lived Assets Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment are recorded on a straight line basis using estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis using the shorter of their estimated service lives or the lease term. When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated service life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated service life. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major repairs that extend service lives are capitalized. The estimated service lives by major asset category are as follows: Land improvements 15 years Buildings and leasehold improvements 540 years Fixtures and equipment 515 years Computer software costs 5 years Transportation equipment 320 years Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived asset are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. The Companys assumptions related to valuation of long lived assets include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results, and projected cash flows. The Company estimates the fair value of its long lived assets using readily available market information for similar assets. 27 When material, the Company classifies the results of operations of closed stores as discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the stores have been (or will be) eliminated from ongoing operations and the Company no longer has any significant continuing involvement in the operations associated with the stores after closure. The Company generally meets the second criteria on all closed stores as, upon closure, operations cease and the Company has no continuing involvement. To determine if cash flows have been (or will be) eliminated from ongoing operations, the Company evaluates a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to, proximity to remaining open stores and estimates of sales migration from the closed store to any stores remaining open. The estimated sales migration is based on the Companys historical estimates of sales migration upon opening a new store in a similar market. For purposes of reporting the operations of stores meeting the criteria for discontinued operations, the Company reports net sales, gross margin, and related operating costs that are directly related to and specifically identifiable with respect to those stores operations as discontinued operations. Certain corporate level charges, such as general office cost, field operations, national advertising, fixed distribution costs, and interest cost, are not allocated to discontinued operations because the Company believes that these costs are not specific to the stores operations. Insurance Reserves The Company is self insured for certain losses relating to property, general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical and dental benefit claims, a portion of which is paid by employees. The Company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit significant exposure in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimated accruals are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account known trends and projections of future results. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at the Companys estimate of their net present value while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted. Actual future claims experience can impact these calculations and, to the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from estimates, future earnings could be impacted materially. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals and deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Contingencies The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies including legal actions, lease termination obligations on closed stores, lease indemnification obligations on KB Toys stores, and other claims arising out of the normal course of business. In connection with such claims and contingencies, the Company estimates the likelihood and amounts of any potential obligation using managements judgment. Management uses subject matter experts including various internal and external experts to assist in the estimating process; however, the ultimate outcome of the various claims and contingencies could be materially different from managements estimates, and adjustments to income could be required. With respect to the lease termination obligations and lease indemnification obligations, the Company considers the remaining minimum lease payments, estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained, and other potentially mitigating factors. In addition, as market conditions or other factors change, the estimate of the obligations could be materially different. The Company continually evaluates the adequacy of its recorded obligations for claims and contingences based on current information, including settlement amounts of individual lease obligations compared to recorded contractual obligations. The Company accrues a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable), or if it is probable but an estimate is not determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, 28 because it is not permissible to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable, in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial, for example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement). Lease Accounting Rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease. The Company recognizes minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred incentive rent. The Company also receives tenant allowances, which are recorded in deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception. Contingent rent includes rent based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level. Contingent rent is excluded from minimum rent and is included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Pension Pension assumptions are evaluated each year. Outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated obligations for pension. The Company reviews external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return. The Companys objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date. In making this estimate, the Company reviews rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits. This process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of Aa or better. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets, the Company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the current or anticipated future allocation of the pension portfolio. The discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for fiscal year 2005 was 5.7%. A 0.5% decrease in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension cost by $0.2 million. The long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in fiscal year 2005 was 8.5%. A 1.0% decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by $0.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires an entity to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award using an option pricing model. The cost of the awards, including the related tax effects, will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. This statement eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method for valuing share based compensation, which typically resulted in recognition of no compensation cost. On April 15, 2005, the SEC issued Release No. 33 8568, which amended the effective date for SFAS No. 123(R), to the first interim or annual period of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) as of January 29, 2006, using the modified prospective method of adoption, in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the date of adoption of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date. Because the Company previously accounted for options issued under the Companys incentive plans under the intrinsic value method permitted under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is expected to have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations, although it will have no impact on the Companys overall financial position. The impact of SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be accurately estimated at this time, as it will depend on the market value and amount of share based awards granted in future periods. However, had the Company adopted 29 SFAS No. 123(R) in a prior period, the impact would approximate the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that tax benefits received in excess of compensation cost be reclassified from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. This change in classification will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption for any excess tax benefits realized. While the amount of this change cannot be estimated at this time, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was not significant in fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the acceleration of vesting on certain stock options in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement. Thus, the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred, generally upon acquisition, constructions, or development and or through the normal operation of the asset. Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. SFAS No. 143 acknowledges that in some cases, sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and this adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Commitments For a discussion of commitments, refer to Note 2, Note 4, Note 5, and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates associated with the 2004 Credit Agreement. The Company had no fixed rate long term debt at January 28, 2006. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates in fiscal year 2006 to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity; however, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change. The Company does not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in interest rates would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company purchases approximately 30.6% of its product directly from overseas suppliers, all of which are purchased in U.S. dollars. 30
