ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related Notes included herein. Please refer to Item 1A of this Form 10 K for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We follow the concept of a 52 53 week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. Fiscal year 2006 was comprised of 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were each comprised of 52 weeks. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS Operating Initiatives and Results The following is an overview of significant operating initiatives that have been executed or are in progress that we believe led or contributed to improved operating performance in fiscal year 2006 compared to the prior fiscal year. Actions taken in fiscal year 2005: Evaluation of individual store performance and the closure of 174 stores including all of our stand alone furniture stores. The majority of these closed stores were underperforming. Execution of a series of markdowns lowering in store inventory levels in certain categories and improving turnover. Realignment of our field operations and elimination of some redundancies between closeout and furniture store operations. Reduction of personnel at our stores, distribution centers, and general office. Exit from the frozen food business. Actions taken in fiscal year 2006: Opened fewer stores compared to prior years primarily as a result of rising real estate costs for prospective new sites and our focused efforts on improving operating results of existing stores. Tested and executed newly developed merchandising plans focusing on obtaining higher gross margin dollars and improved inventory turnover. Tested and evaluated marketing approach including in store signage, mix and amount of television advertising, and advertising circular print and distribution methods. Continued to focus on improving efficiencies in our purchasing and distribution practices intending to increase store productivity. Initiated a pilot project to test a new point of sale register system that will replace our existing point of sale hardware and software, with installation in all stores during fiscal years 2007 and 2008. We believe these initiatives and activities have contributed to our operating performance for fiscal year 2006 when compared to the operating performance of fiscal year 2005: Comparable store sales increased 4.6%. Sales per selling square foot improved by 8.2%. Gross margin dollars improved $159.8 million with fewer stores included in continuing operations. Inventory turnover rate improved to 3.4 times versus 3.0 times in fiscal year 2005. 17 Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales improved 180 basis points to 34.2% of sales versus 36.0% of sales in fiscal year 2005. Depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased 40 basis points to 2.1% of sales versus 2.5% of sales in fiscal year 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to $1.01 per share compared to $0.14 per share in fiscal year 2005. Cash provided by operating activities was $381.5 million and we ended fiscal year 2006 with $281.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Acquired 9.4 million of our common shares for a total cost of $150.0 million under the repurchase program announced in February 2006. See the discussion and analysis below for additional details of our operating results. Litigation In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we reached tentative settlements of two employment related civil class actions brought against us. The tentative settlements are subject to court approval and acceptance by the class. We recorded, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, a pretax charge of $9.7 million included in selling and administrative expenses for the estimated settlement liability for these matters. We believe that the liability for these matters was adequately reserved at February 3, 2007. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional detail on these matters. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we recorded pretax income of $2.6 million in selling and administrative expenses upon receipt of our portion of the Visa/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement funds that compensate merchants for the excessive fees they paid for certain Visa and MasterCard transactions. Whats Important Now (WIN) Strategy In 2005, we initiated a strategic assessment of our operations. Specifically, we focused on opportunities for improved financial performance as a result of a detailed analysis of our real estate, operating expenses, and merchandising. This strategic assessment resulted in specific initiatives collectively referred to by us as our WIN Strategy. Real Estate As a result of the real estate analysis conducted as part of the WIN Strategy, we closed 174 stores during fiscal year 2005, a significant portion of which were underperforming. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the operating results of 130 of these closed stores were reclassified to discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 and all prior periods reported. The table below identifies the significant components of loss from discontinued operations related to the 130 closed stores for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net sales $ $ 215,154 $ 225,820 Gross margin 74,109 90,299 Operating loss (2,659 ) (41,130 ) (1,662 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,606 ) $ (25,381 ) $ (1,021 ) Our results related to discontinued operations in fiscal year 2006 primarily represent exit related costs and ongoing costs associated with leased properties yet to be terminated or subleased. Our results of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 include pretax losses in the amount of $41.1 million, including $43.6 million of exit related pretax costs. 18 The table below summarizes the type and amount of charges recorded as a result of the store closures and identifies remaining exit liabilities as of February 3, 2007: Write down of Property, Severance Lease Inventory, and and Termination Deferred Rent Benefits Costs Total (In thousands) Charges $ 19,600 $ 3,300 $ 20,700 $ 43,600 Payments (1,539 ) (2,499 ) (4,038 ) Non cash reductions (19,600 ) (19,600 ) Remaining Obligations at January 28, 2006 1,761 18,201 19,962 Settlement savings (1,346 ) (1,346 ) Accretion expense 411 411 Payments (1,761 ) (11,329 ) (13,090 ) Remaining Obligations at February 3, 2007 $ $ $ 5,937 $ 5,937 Write downs of property and inventory include assets used in normal operations of retail stores and remaining unrecoverable net book values of fixtures, equipment, and signs. The inventory write downs above were specific to the markdowns associated with liquidation sales conducted at the closed stores, which qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment. We record markdowns throughout the year in the normal course of business. The markdowns associated with the liquidation sales were the only markdowns included in the table above. Future cash outlays related to the above lease termination costs are anticipated to be $3.4 million in fiscal year 2007, $1.8 million in fiscal year 2008, $0.6 million in fiscal year 2009, and $0.1 million thereafter. Operating Expenses Our review of our operating expenses resulted in personnel reductions in our general office, field operations, and distribution centers in fiscal year 2005. Certain resources were realigned based on the fiscal year 2005 store closings and lower expected store growth in the near term. Additionally, some redundancies between the closeout store operations and the furniture store operations were eliminated. Merchandising In fiscal year 2005, as part of a review of our merchandising strategy, we: 1) closed our stand alone furniture stores; 2) executed a series of markdowns lowering in store inventory levels in certain categories and improving inventory turnover; and 3) exited the frozen food business. We developed our merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per square foot and increasing gross margin dollars. We performed customer research and found that brand names, treasure hunt, price, value, and savings were most important to our customers. Certain elements of the merchandising strategy were tested and executed in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2006, we refined the detailed merchandising plans in order for each merchant to understand his or her targeted levels of closeout merchandise, engineered closeout merchandise (items that we often develop along with our vendors), and consistency type products that our customers expect us to have. Our preference is to maximize the amount of closeout merchandise which we believe provides great value to the customer. We have communicated many of these expectations to our vendors so that they understand our expectations and can collaborate with us to get the desired types and quantities of merchandise to our stores. One of the key elements to the success of the fiscal year 2006 merchandising strategy was the raise the ring strategy. The raise the ring strategy involves offering a merchandise mix to the customer that includes items with slightly higher average item retail sales price. One method used to accomplish this was to offer larger package or quantity sizes. For example, instead of offering an item for sale on a per piece basis, we may offer 19 the same product in a package of three or six pieces. Another part of the raise the ring strategy involved offering types of merchandise that helped increase average item retail, based on our belief that as long as the value proposition is compelling, our customers are willing to purchase higher ticket merchandise from us. Improved merchandising led to efficiencies in the cost side of the business as well. Inventory quantities were managed to lower levels helping to drive productivity in the distribution centers and stores. Our merchants worked with vendors to acquire items that were pre ticketed for sale and more efficiently and effectively allocated to and displayed in our stores. Markdowns were taken timely in order to keep merchandise in our stores fresh and to improve inventory turnover. Fewer cartons were processed by our distribution centers and stores while higher sales dollars were achieved. Our marketing efforts continued to involve a mix of circulars, in store marketing, and television advertising. During fiscal year 2006, we shifted circular and television advertising dollars to the November and December (the Nine Weeks of Christmas) timeframe in order to commit more marketing expenditures during the period they could be expected to have the most impact. Many of the products offered in these circulars were a result of the merchandising strategies discussed above. The planning and coordination that went into these circulars improved their effectiveness and resulted in higher sales, higher gross margin dollars, and improved inventory turnover rate. Because the majority of our customers consider themselves to be treasure hunters and come to our store without a specific item in mind to purchase, we developed better in store marketing strategies, such as improved signage, aimed at driving total sales dollars from each customer in the store. This new signage was tested favorably during fiscal year 2006 and was rolled out to all stores late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.

Results of Operations The following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 60.1 60.9 59.3 Gross margin 39.9 39.1 40.7 Selling and administrative expenses 34.2 36.0 36.6 Depreciation expense 2.1 2.5 2.4 Operating profit 3.5 0.6 1.7 Interest expense (0.0 ) (0.1 ) (0.6 ) Interest and investment income 0.1 0.0 0.0 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 3.6 0.5 1.1 Income tax expense 1.2 0.1 0.3 Income from continuing operations 2.4 0.4 0.8 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 0.2 (0.6 ) (0.2 ) Net income (loss) 2.6 % (0.2 )% 0.6 % We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit being realized in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores, the timing of television and circular advertising, and the timing of 20 certain holidays. We purchase substantial amounts of inventory and incur higher shipping and payroll costs as a percent of sales in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit by fiscal quarter: First Second Third Fourth Fiscal Year 2006 Net sales percentage of full year 23.0 % 22.3 % 22.1 % 32.6 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 12.7 4.3 1.4 81.6 Fiscal Year 2005 Net sales percentage of full year 23.5 % 22.6 % 22.4 % 31.5 % Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year 46.6 (66.5 ) (113.7 ) 233.6 Fiscal Year 2006 Compared To Fiscal Year 2005 Net Sales Net sales increased 7.1% to $4,743.0 million in fiscal year 2006 compared to $4,429.9 million in fiscal year 2005. This net sales increase of $313.1 million is principally due to a 4.6% increase in comparable store sales and sales made during the 53rd week in fiscal year 2006. Our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of fiscal year 2006. This calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods. From a merchandise perspective, the Consumables, Home, and Other were the best performing categories. Within the Consumables category, sales of food and health and beauty products drove the increase partially offset by the decline in sales of frozen food, which we discontinued in fiscal year 2005. Within the Home category, sales of furniture and domestics drove the increase. Within the Other category, increases in sales of electronics and apparel were partially offset by lower sales of lingerie. We internally evaluate and externally communicate overall sales and merchandise performances based on the following key merchandising categories, and we believe these categories facilitate analysis of our financial performance. Net sales by product category, net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 were as follows: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $1,369,590 28.9 % $1,275,851 28.8 % $ 93,739 7.3 % Home 1,473,052 31.1 1,333,602 30.1 139,450 10.5 Seasonal and toys 840,416 17.7 830,526 18.7 9,890 1.2 Other 1,059,990 22.3 989,926 22.4 70,064 7.1 Net sales $4,743,048 100.0 % $4,429,905 100.0 % $313,143 7.1 % Gross Margin Gross margin dollars increased 9.2% to $1,891.4 million in fiscal year 2006 compared to $1,731.7 million in fiscal year 2005. We achieved our stated goal to increase gross margin dollars as gross margin improved by $159.7 million principally due to a combination of higher net sales and a slightly higher gross margin rate. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 39.9% in fiscal year 2006 compared to 39.1% in fiscal year 2005. This gross margin rate increase of 80 basis points was primarily due to an improvement in the initial mark up of merchandise purchased in fiscal year 2006 compared to purchases in fiscal year 2005. This improvement is primarily attributed to our merchandising strategies as previously discussed. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.4 turns in fiscal year 2006 compared to 3.0 turns in fiscal year 2005. 21 Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 1.6% to $1,622.3 million in fiscal year 2006 compared to $1,596.1 million in fiscal year 2005. While net sales increased $313.1 million, selling and administrative expenses increased only $26.2 million and as a result, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 34.2% in fiscal year 2006 compared to 36.0% in fiscal year 2005. The following items contributed to the 180 basis point improvement in selling and administrative expense leverage: 1) the 4.6% increase in comparable store sales, which was above our expense leverage point; 2) our raise the ring merchandising strategy which delivered higher sales results with fewer cartons processed by the distribution centers and stores; 3) reduction in general office and field operations headcount primarily due to the elimination of some redundancies between closeout and furniture store operations; and 4) various initiatives aimed at improving efficiency at our stores and distribution centers including tightly managed payroll budgets, the initiation of a vendor compliance program, and merchandising strategies aimed at getting merchandise delivered that is more efficiently able to be displayed on the selling floor, for example, pre ticketed items and improved packaging (PDQ packaging, palletized end cap displays, etc.). Some of the increases in selling and administrative expense components from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2006 were bonus expense of $22.0 million, wage litigation charges of $9.7 million, utilities of $6.5 million, stock based compensation expense of $5.7 million, and asset impairment charges of $5.0 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in store hourly wages of $10.7 million, general office wages of $5.2 million, field operations cost of $4.2 million, and proceeds received as a result of the Visa/MasterCard antitrust settlement of $2.6 million. The bonus expense increase is due primarily to our improved financial performance in fiscal year 2006 and compares to fiscal year 2005 where no general office bonus was paid. The wage litigation charges are discussed in more detail in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Higher utilities are primarily a result of higher utility rates. Stock based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) (See Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and the achievement of a performance based target with respect to restricted shares granted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The asset impairment charges relate primarily to charges taken on certain underperforming stores that were opened in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Lower store hourly wages, even with the $313.1 million increase in sales, are a result of improved productivity in the stores primarily due to lower inventory levels at the stores and our raise the ring merchandising strategy. The decline in general office and field operations expenses are primarily a result of the reduction in headcount which included the elimination of some redundancies in the furniture and closeout operations. Outbound distribution and transportation costs, which were included in selling and administrative expenses (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) decreased 0.8% to $222.1 million in fiscal year 2006 compared to $223.8 million in fiscal year 2005. Outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.7% in fiscal year 2006 compared to 5.1% in fiscal year 2005. The 40 basis point decrease was primarily due to our raise the ring merchandising strategy which resulted in fewer cartons being processed through the distribution centers with higher carton values. In addition, our emphasis on improved inventory turnover led to lower inventory levels maintained in the distribution centers. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense for fiscal year 2006 was $101.3 million compared to $108.7 million for fiscal year 2005. The $7.4 million decrease was principally related to a declining amount of capital expenditures in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The lower capital expenditures are principally related to opening 11 stores in fiscal year 2006 and a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development of a new point of sale register system and other items generally considered maintenance capital items for our distribution centers and stores in fiscal year 2006. Fiscal year 2005 capital expenditures included capital related to the completion of reengineering of our Columbus, Ohio distribution center. Upon the successful completion of a pilot program in 32 of our stores and the decision to move forward with the implementation of a new point of sale system in all of our stores, we reduced the remaining estimated service life on approximately $6.9 million of certain point of sale equipment. The impact of this service life reduction 22 was to recognize approximately $2.3 million of depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. The estimated remaining service life was based on our projected roll out schedule to all remaining stores, approximately one half in fiscal year 2007 and one half in fiscal year 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 90.5% to $0.6 million in fiscal year 2006 compared to $6.3 million in fiscal year 2005. The $5.7 million decrease in interest expense was principally due to lower average borrowings of $4.8 million in fiscal year 2006 compared to average borrowings of $139.9 million in fiscal year 2005. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income increased $3.0 million in fiscal year 2006 to $3.3 million compared to $0.3 million in fiscal year 2005. Because we generated significant cash flow from our operations, we were in an invested position throughout the majority of fiscal year 2006. We invested primarily in money market type investments that are considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 33.9% for fiscal year 2006 compared to 24.8% for fiscal year 2005. In fiscal year 2006, we benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of our expectation of utilizing more net operating loss benefits and the resolution of certain income tax matters. The rate was lower in fiscal year 2005 principally due to 1) proportionately larger jurisdictional losses in entities with higher marginal income tax rates, 2) lower overall income before income taxes, and 3) loss contingency activity partially offset by higher write down of deferred income tax assets as a result of state tax law changes. The Company anticipates the fiscal year 2007 effective income tax rate to be within a range of 36.0% to 39.0%. Discontinued Operations We recorded income from discontinued operations of $11.4 million in fiscal year 2006 compared to loss from discontinued operations of $25.8 million in fiscal year 2005. The income from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2006 was principally comprised of 1) the partial release of our KB bankruptcy lease obligation (as defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) of $8.7 million, net of tax, and 2) the release of KB related income tax and sales tax indemnification liabilities of $4.7 million, net of tax, partially offset by 1) a loss on the sale of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center (formerly owned by the KB Toys business) of approximately $1.4 million, net of tax; and 2) exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $1.6 million, net of tax, including a $0.7 million, pretax pension settlement charge and expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases have not been terminated. We based the revision of the KB bankruptcy lease obligation on the number of demand notices that we have received from landlords and used information received from KB Toys, the bankruptcy trust, and our own lease records which date back to when we owned the KB Toys business. Additionally, we released the tax indemnification liabilities in light of information that we received as a result of our settlement discussions with the bankruptcy trust and KB in an attempt to resolve the tax indemnification claims. Our loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 included $25.4 million, net of tax, primarily related to exit costs and fiscal year 2005 results of operations of the 130 stores, $0.6 million of income, net of tax, for the reversal of liabilities associated with the KB Toys business, and $1.0 million, net of tax, associated with the write down of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center to fair value less selling cost, upon classification as held for sale. Fiscal Year 2005 Compared To Fiscal Year 2004 Net Sales Net sales increased 6.8% to $4,429.9 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $4,149.3 million in fiscal year 2004. This increase is due to new stores opened in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and the comparable store sales increase of 1.8% for fiscal year 2005. From a merchandise perspective, Home, which includes furniture, was 23 the best performing category. As part of our merchandising initiatives, clearance markdowns, primarily in the fourth quarter, benefited net sales and comparable store sales and were initiated to reduce inventory levels on slower moving items or classifications. Net sales by product category, net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales, and the net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 were as follows: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $1,275,851 28.8 % $1,247,207 30.1 % $ 28,644 2.3 % Home 1,333,602 30.1 1,153,297 27.8 180,305 15.6 Seasonal and toys 830,526 18.7 814,661 19.6 15,865 1.9 Other 989,926 22.4 934,087 22.5 55,839 6.0 Net sales $4,429,905 100.0 % $4,149,252 100.0 % $280,653 6.8 % The Consumables category includes sales increases in plastics, paper, and food, partially offset by a decrease in health and beauty. The Home category includes strong performance in furniture and home decor. Seasonal and toys includes sales increases for lawn & garden and toys, partially offset by decreases in trim a tree and harvest. The Other category includes strong performances in electronics, home appliances, and tools. Gross Margin Gross margin dollars increased 2.6% to $1,731.7 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1,687.1 million in fiscal year 2004. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 39.1% in fiscal year 2005 compared to 40.7% in fiscal year 2004. This gross margin rate decline of 160 basis points was primarily due to clearance related markdowns, higher inbound freight costs, and certain initial markup related cost pressures such as higher resin based material costs. Inbound freight costs were higher as a result of higher fuel costs and transportation capacity constraints. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 5.1% to $1,596.1 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1,518.6 million in fiscal year 2004. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 36.0% in fiscal year 2005 compared to 36.6% in fiscal year 2004. Selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year 2004 primarily due to costs associated with higher levels of sales and increased carton volume. The $77.5 million increase was primarily attributable to increased store payroll costs of $20.9 million, increased store occupancy related costs, including rent and utilities, of $23.0 million, increased general office costs of $11.7 million, the partial charge off of the HCC Note of $6.4 million (as defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), increased advertising costs of $6.0 million, and increased distribution and transportation costs of $5.1 million. The increase in general office cost primarily resulted from an increase in wage and benefit related costs. Outbound distribution and transportation costs, which were included in selling and administrative expenses (see Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) increased 2.3% to $223.8 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $218.7 million in fiscal year 2004. Outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 5.1% in fiscal year 2005 compared to 5.3% in fiscal year 2004. The 20 basis point decrease was primarily due to improved efficiency at the distribution centers, particularly the Durant, Oklahoma distribution center. In addition, productivity has improved at the Columbus distribution center after two years of re engineering efforts. Partially offsetting these cost savings were higher diesel fuel costs incurred on outbound freight and higher utility costs at the distribution centers. 24 Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense for fiscal year 2005 was $108.7 million compared to $99.4 million for fiscal year 2004. The $9.3 million increase was principally related to new store growth. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 74.6% to $6.3 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $24.8 million in fiscal year 2004. The $18.5 million decrease in interest expense was due to the $8.9 million debt prepayment charge incurred in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the repayment of the $204.0 million in senior notes privately placed in 2001 (the Senior Notes) and the retirement of the $300.0 million secured revolving credit agreement entered into in 2001 (the 2001 Credit Agreement), lower average borrowings in fiscal year 2005, and a lower effective interest rate in fiscal year 2005. The prepayment charge was incurred in order to replace the Senior Notes, which carried a weighted average yield of 8.2%, and the 2001 Credit Agreement with the variable rate 2004 Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate of the outstanding loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement at January 28, 2006, was 5.1%. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate of the continuing operations of the Company was 24.8% for fiscal year 2005 compared to 30.1% for fiscal year 2004. The rate was lower in fiscal year 2005 because of 1) proportionately larger jurisdictional losses in entities with higher marginal income tax rates; and 2) the adjustment of loss contingencies to recognize the expiration of the statute of limitations; offset by the write down of deferred income tax assets as a result of state tax law changes (including Ohio tax reform enacted in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005). Discontinued Operations We recorded a pretax loss of $41.7 million from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 compared to a pretax loss of $13.0 million in fiscal year 2004. Our results of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 include pretax losses in the amount of $41.1 million as the result of 130 stores reported in discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005 which include $43.6 million of exit related pretax costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the reversal of pretax charges of $0.4 million associated with the KB Toys business and pretax charges of $1.0 million associated with the reclassification of the Pittsfield distribution center (Pittsfield DC) as held for sale and the related write down of its carrying value to fair value less selling cost. Our discontinued operations in fiscal year 2004 relate to pretax losses in the amount of $1.7 million as the result of the 130 stores reported in discontinued operations and pretax charges of $11.3 million associated with the KB Toys business. Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital Resources On October 29, 2004, we entered into the $500.0 million 2004 Credit Agreement which is scheduled to terminate on October 28, 2009. The proceeds of the 2004 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain of our indebtedness. The pricing and fees related to the 2004 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating. Loans made under the 2004 Credit Agreement may be prepaid by us without penalty. The 2004 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens, and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the 2004 Credit Agreement, which would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2004 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit, and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement. On December 22, 2006, we entered into a second amendment to the 2004 Credit Agreement in order to permit us to acquire investments rated by a third rating agency. On October 25, 2005, we entered into an amendment to the 2004 Credit Agreement in order to 25 eliminate the impact on the covenant calculations of the charges related to the store closings discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. We were in compliance with our amended financial covenants under the 2004 Credit Agreement at February 3, 2007. The 2004 Credit Agreement permits, at our option, borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or London InterBank Offering Rate plus applicable margin. The 2004 Credit Agreement also permits, as applicable, borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by us and the lenders. We typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis in accordance with the terms of the 2004 Credit Agreement. The daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position, which is generally affected by: 1) cash inflows such as store cash and other miscellaneous deposits; and 2) cash outflows such as check clearings, wire and other electronic transactions, and other miscellaneous disbursements. In addition to revolving credit loans, the 2004 Credit Agreement includes a $30.0 million swing loan sub limit, a $50.0 million bid loan sub limit, and a $150.0 million letter of credit sub limit. At February 3, 2007, we did not have borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement. The borrowings available under the 2004 Credit Agreement, after taking into account the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $57.9 million, were $442.1 million at February 3, 2007. We utilize our credit facility primarily to manage ongoing and seasonal working capital. Given the seasonality of our business, the amount of borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors, including our performance, the time of year, and our need to acquire merchandise inventory. We anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than $65.0 million through the end of May 2007, all of which will be comprised of letters of credit, excluding any impact from the execution of the $600.0 million share repurchase authorized by our Board of Directors in March 2007. Liquidity The primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operations and, as necessary, borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement. At February 3, 2007, working capital was $674.8 million, including $269.4 million of money market investments included in cash and cash equivalents. Cash provided by operating activities was $381.5 million during fiscal year 2006 and resulted primarily from net income of $124.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $95.6 million, a reduction in inventories of $77.9 million, timing associated with current income taxes of $44.1 million, and improved accounts payable leverage of $24.0 million. Lower inventories are principally due to our continued efforts to improve the inventory turnover rate and to keep store merchandise fresh. Our income tax position was favorable because we received income tax refunds in fiscal year 2006 related primarily to the overpayment of taxes in fiscal year 2005 and had income taxes payable of approximately $28.0 million at the end of fiscal year 2006. We improved our accounts payable leverage principally by extending payment terms to foreign vendors. Cash provided by operating activities was $213.0 million during fiscal year 2005 and resulted primarily from net loss of $(10.1) million, depreciation and amortization expense of $114.6 million, and a decrease in net assets of $102.7 million over fiscal year 2004. The $102.7 million decrease in net assets was primarily a result of lower inventory of $58.9 million, higher accounts payable of $11.9 million, higher other current liabilities of $21.2 million, and cash from other assets and liabilities of $21.9 million. The reduction in inventory is primarily a result of fewer stores open at the end of fiscal year 2005 compared to prior year and the impact of the markdown clearance sales. The increase in other current liabilities is primarily due to the increased current portion of lease obligation resulting from the closure of certain stores before their full lease term expired. The cash from other assets and liabilities is primarily due to the non current portion of the lease obligation associated with the closed stores and an increase in the non current portion of insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liability. Cash used in investing activities of $30.4 million in fiscal year 2006 and $66.7 million in fiscal year 2005 was primarily related to capital expenditures of $35.9 million and $68.5 million in each of the respective fiscal years. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2006 were primarily related to opening 11 new stores, software development cost for our new point of sale system, and various distribution center, store, or lease related requirements. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2005 were primarily due to opening 73 new stores. Capital expenditure 26 requirements in fiscal year 2007 are anticipated to range between $70 million and $75 million, focused on the new register system being implemented in approximately one half of our stores, maintaining existing property and equipment, a limited number of new store openings, and information technology enhancements. Cash used in financing activities was $71.1 million in fiscal year 2006 and related principally to the $150.0 million share repurchase program partially offset by $57.5 million of stock option exercise proceeds, $13.3 million of proceeds from selling one of our owned store properties, and $11.9 million for the excess tax benefit derived from the exercise of stock options by employees. Cash used in financing activities was $147.1 million in fiscal year 2005 and related primarily to the net repayment of borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement. We announced a share repurchase program of up to $600.0 million on March 9, 2007. See Item 5 of this Form 10 K for more information regarding this program. We continue to believe that we have, or, if necessary, have the ability to obtain adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments, or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on our capital resources or liquidity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at February 3, 2007: Payments Due by Period (1) Less than More than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years 5 years Total (In thousands) Long term debt obligations (2) $ $ $ $ $ Operating lease obligations (3) (4) 249,789 388,115 206,853 115,030 959,787 Purchase obligations (4) (5) 549,895 102,570 62,392 72,210 787,067 Other long term liabilities (6) 5,482 6,661 4,407 10,401 26,951 Total contractual obligations (7) $ 805,166 $ 497,346 $273,652 $197,641 $1,773,805 (1) The disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report. Those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate; consequently, the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur. Variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include, but are not limited to: the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration; fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation; the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report; fluctuations in third party fees, governmental charges, or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors; and the exercise of renewal options under, or the automatic renewal of, contracts that provide for the same. (2) Long term debt obligations consist of the borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement are permitted under various interest rate options based on the prime rate or London InterBank Offering Rate plus applicable margin, as well as borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by us and the lenders. We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $57.9 million at February 3, 2007. Approximately $57.5 million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit; accordingly, they have been excluded from the preceding table. The remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in Purchase Obligations. For a further discussion, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 27 (3) Operating lease obligations include, among other items, leases for our retail stores, warehouse space, offices, and certain computer and other business equipment. The future minimum commitments for store and warehouse space operating leases are $719.4 million. For a discussion of leases, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. We estimate that future obligations for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance are $220.0 million at February 3, 2007. We have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Those assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: extrapolation of historical data to estimate our future obligations; calculation of our obligations based on per square foot averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold; and assumptions related to certain increases over historical data where our obligation is a prorated share of all lessees obligations within a particular property. The remaining $20.4 million relates primarily to the operating leases for computer and other business equipment. (4) For purposes of the operating lease and purchase obligation disclosures, we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date, and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and our vendor, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension. Where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term, we disclosed our minimum commitment under such obligation, such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term, due to the uncertainty of the length of the eventual term. (5) Purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at $420.7 million, the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of February 3, 2007. Purchase obligations also include a commitment for future inventory purchases totaling $227.2 million at February 3, 2007. While we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment, for purposes of this tabular disclosure, we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods, as purchases will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation. The remaining $139.2 million is primarily related to distribution and transportation commitments. (6) Other long term liabilities include our obligation related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the $5.9 million closed store lease termination costs, and the expected pension plan contributions. We have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions. Our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms. Pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans.) (7) The obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities, guarantees, and indemnities related to KB Toys. For further discussion, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of February 3, 2007, we have approximately 84 KB Lease Obligations related to KB Toys stores and main office building. The relevant guarantees were issued prior to January 1, 2003, and are not subject to the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45. The typical KB Lease Obligation provides that the terms of the underlying lease may be extended, amended, or modified without the consent of the guarantor. As a result, we are unable to estimate any potential range of loss in the event of non performance by KB Toys. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for further discussion of KB Toys matters. 28 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long lived assets, insurance reserves, income taxes, contingencies, leases, pension, revenue recognition, and stock based compensation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to reporting our results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policies. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price. Under the average cost retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics, at its current retail selling value. Inventory retail selling values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department. Cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity. The average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross margin. These assumptions are based on historical experience and current information. Permanent markdowns are recorded as a gross margin reduction in the period of managements decision to initiate price reductions with the intent not to return the price to regular retail. Promotional markdowns are recorded as a gross margin reduction in the period the merchandise is sold. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, and seasonal trends. Shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories and gross margin and is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period. Such estimates are based on our actual experience and our most recent physical inventory results. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, we have loss prevention programs and policies that we believe minimize shrinkage. Long Lived Assets Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment are recorded on a straight line basis using estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis using the shorter of their estimated service lives or the lease term. When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated service life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated service life. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major repairs that extend service lives are capitalized. 29 The estimated service lives of property and equipment by major asset category are as follows: Land improvements 15 years Buildings and leasehold improvements 540 years Fixtures and equipment 515 years Computer software costs 37 years Transportation equipment 320 years We have long lived assets that consist primarily of property and equipment. We review historical operating results at the store level in order to determine if impairment indicators are present. Impairment is recorded if impairment indicators are present and if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows. Our assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods. We estimate service lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends. We estimate the fair value of our long lived assets using readily available market information for similar assets. When material, we classify the results of operations of closed stores as discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the stores have been (or will be) eliminated from ongoing operations and we no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the operations associated with the stores after closure. We generally meet the second criteria on all closed stores as, upon closure, operations cease and we have no continuing involvement. To determine if cash flows have been (or will be) eliminated from ongoing operations, we evaluate a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to, proximity to remaining open stores and estimates of sales migration from the closed store to any stores remaining open. The estimated sales migration is based on our historical estimates of sales migration upon opening or closing a store in a similar market. For purposes of reporting the operations of stores meeting the criteria for discontinued operations, we report net sales, gross margin, and related operating costs that are directly related to and specifically identifiable with respect to those stores operations as discontinued operations. Certain corporate level charges, such as general office cost, field operations, national advertising, fixed distribution costs, and interest cost are not allocated to discontinued operations because we believe that these costs are not specific to the stores operations. Insurance Reserves We are self insured for certain losses relating to property, general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical and dental benefit claims, a portion of which is paid by employees. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit significant exposure in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimated accruals are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account known trends and projections of future results. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted. To the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from estimates, future earnings could be impacted materially. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals and deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 30 Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies including legal actions, lease termination obligations on closed stores, lease indemnification obligations on KB Toys stores and main office building, and other claims arising out of the normal course of our business. In connection with such claims and contingencies, we estimate the likelihood and amounts of any potential obligation using managements judgment. Management uses various internal and external experts to assist in the estimating process; however, the ultimate outcome of the various claims and contingencies could be materially different from managements estimates, and adjustments to income could be required. With respect to the lease termination obligations and lease indemnification obligations, we consider the remaining minimum lease payments, estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained, and other potentially mitigating factors. In addition, as market conditions or other factors change, the estimate of the obligations could be materially different. We continually evaluate the adequacy of our recorded obligations for claims and contingences based on current information, including settlement amounts of individual lease obligations compared to recorded contractual obligations. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable), or if it is probable but an estimate is not determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, because it is not permissible to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable, in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial, for example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement). Lease Accounting Rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease. We recognize minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred incentive rent. We also receive tenant allowances, which are recorded in deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception. Contingent rent includes rent based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level. Contingent rent is excluded from minimum rent and is included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Pension Pension assumptions are evaluated each year. Actuarial valuations are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated obligations for pension. We review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return. Our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date. In making this estimate, we review rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits. This process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of Aa or better. The expected long term rate of return on assets was derived from detailed periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes, risks (standard deviations), and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long term, prospective rate of return. The discount rates used to determine the net periodic pension cost for fiscal year 2006 were 5.7% to 6.0%. A 0.5% decrease in the discount rates would increase net periodic pension cost by $0.1 million. The long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in fiscal year 2006 was 8.5%. A 1.0% decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by $0.5 million. 31 Revenue Recognition We recognize sales at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise. All sales are net of discounts and returns and exclude sales tax. The reserve for merchandise returns is estimated based on our prior experience. We recognize sales revenue related to gift cards at the time of redemption. The liability for the gift cards is established for the cash value at the time of purchase. The liability for outstanding gift cards is recorded in accrued operating expenses. We offer price hold contracts on selected furniture merchandise. Revenue for price hold contracts is recognized when the customer makes the final payment and takes possession of the merchandise. Amounts paid by customers under price hold contracts are recorded in accrued operating expenses until a sale is consummated. Stock Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 29, 2006, under the modified prospective method, in which the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) are to be applied to new awards and to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date. The modified prospective method does not require restatement of previous years financial statements. We used the short cut method to determine our beginning excess tax benefit pool. The benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We value and expense stock options with graded vesting as a single award with an average estimated life over the entire term of the award. The expense is recorded straight line over the vesting period. The fair value of restricted common shares is measured at the grant date and is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense for performance based restricted common shares is recorded based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria. Compensation expense for all share based awards is recognized in selling and administrative expense. We use a binomial model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted on or after February 1, 2004. The fair value of stock options granted prior to February 1, 2004, was determined using the Black Scholes model. The binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield rate, risk free rate, contractual term of the option, the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life, and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option. Expected volatility was based in part on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares. The risk free rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of the grant. The dividend yield on our common shares was assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The expected life was determined from the binomial model. The model incorporated exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 required us to recognize in the February 3, 2007, statement of financial position an asset for the over funded status or a liability for the under funded status of a defined benefit plan and beginning in fiscal year 2007, to recognize annual changes in gains or losses, prior service costs, or other credits that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost, net of tax through other comprehensive income. Effective in fiscal year 2008, SFAS No. 158 also requires us to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of our year end consolidated balance sheet. Currently, our pension plans have a measurement date of December 31. Switching to the new measurement date will require a one time adjustment in fiscal year 2008 to retained earnings per the transition guidance in SFAS No. 158. 32 We adopted the funding recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 in fiscal year 2006. To properly report the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan) and nonqualified supplemental defined benefit pension plan (Supplemental Pension Plan) we recognized a $5.9 million charge, net of tax benefit of $3.9 million, in accumulated other comprehensive income principally comprised of $0.3 million of prior service costs and $5.6 million of actuarial loss. We expect to reclassify $0.1 million of the prior service cost and $0.3 million of the actuarial loss into earnings during fiscal year 2007. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 158, we combined the Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan for purposes of reporting any net pension asset or obligation. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 158, based on the December 31, 2006 plan valuations, we recognized a $2.8 million asset included in other assets for the Pension Plan and a $4.4 million liability, $0.3 million of which was included in accrued salaries and wages and $4.1 million of which was included in other liabilities, for the Supplemental Pension Plan. In fiscal year 2006, we began reporting separately the pension impact to cash provided by operations on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Prior periods were reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not have any impact on net income in fiscal year 2006. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which is effective as of the beginning of fiscal year 2007. FIN 48 is an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 requires us to recognize in our financial statements the impact of an income tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained, based on the technical merits of the position. The recognition and measurement guidelines of FIN 48 will be applied to all of our income tax positions as of the beginning of fiscal year 2007, with any resulting adjustment posted as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to beginning retained earnings of fiscal year 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB No. 108), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 provides guidance to registrants for assessing materiality. SAB No. 108 states that registrants should use both a balance sheet approach and income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement. SAB No. 108 also provides guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach as well as transition guidance for correcting previously immaterial errors that are now considered material. We adopted SAB No. 108 as of February 3, 2007, without any impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value when required by GAAP. SFAS No. 157 does not create or modify any GAAP requirements to apply fair value accounting. The standard provides a single definition of fair value that is to be applied consistently for all accounting applications and also generally describes and prioritizes according to reliability the methods and inputs used in valuations. SFAS No. 157 prescribes additional disclosures regarding the extent of fair value measurements included in a companys financial statements and the methods and inputs used to arrive at these values. SFAS No. 157 is effective on a prospective basis for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We expect no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity from adopting this statement. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. We are presently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 on our results of operations and financial position. Commitments For a discussion of commitments, refer to Note 3, Note 5, Note 10, and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements herein. 33 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates associated with investments that we make from time to time and the 2004 Credit Agreement. We had no fixed rate long term debt at February 3, 2007. We do not expect changes in interest rates in fiscal year 2007 to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity; however, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change. We do not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in interest rates would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 34
