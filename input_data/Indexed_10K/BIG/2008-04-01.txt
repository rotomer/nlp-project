ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. Please refer to Item 1A of this Form 10 K for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years with 52 weeks and some with 53 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 was comprised of 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2007 and 2005 each were comprised of 52 weeks. Operating Results Summary The following are the results from 2007 (52 weeks) that we believe are key indicators of our operating performance when compared to our operating performance in 2006 (53 weeks). Comparable store sales for stores open at least two years at the beginning of 2007 increased 2.0%. Sales per selling square foot were $158 in both 2007 and 2006. Net sales declined 1.8%. Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased 40 basis points to 39.5% of sales from 39.9% of sales in 2006. Gross margin dollars were lower by 2.7%. Average inventory levels were lower throughout 2007 compared to 2006 and, combined with the 2.0% increase in comparable store sales, resulted in a higher turnover rate of 3.5 times in 2007 compared to 3.4 times in 2006. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased 170 basis points to 32.5% of sales from 34.2% of sales in 2006. Depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased 20 basis points to 1.9% of sales from 2.1% of sales in 2006. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to $1.47 per share compared to $1.01 per share in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities was $307.9 million in 2007 compared to $381.5 million in 2006. We acquired 30.0 million of our common shares under our publicly announced repurchase programs for a total cost of $712.5 million, while having outstanding debt at the end of 2007 of $163.7 million. In 2006, we acquired 9.4 million of our common shares under publicly announced repurchase programs for a total cost of $150.0 million. 19 The following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales: 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 60.5 60.1 60.9 Gross margin 39.5 39.9 39.1 Selling and administrative expenses 32.5 34.2 36.0 Depreciation expense 1.9 2.1 2.5 Operating profit 5.1 3.5 0.6 Interest expense (0.1 ) (0.0 ) (0.1 ) Interest and investment income 0.1 0.1 0.0 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 5.1 3.6 0.5 Income tax expense 1.9 1.2 0.1 Income from continuing operations 3.2 2.4 0.4 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 0.2 0.2 (0.6 ) Net income (loss) 3.4 % 2.6 % (0.2 )% See the discussion and analysis below for additional details of the specific components of our operating results comparing the 2007 results to 2006 and the 2006 results to 2005. Selling and administrative expenses in 2007 were reduced by $5.2 million (10 basis points) of proceeds from the KB Toys bankruptcy trust (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) and $4.9 million (10 basis points) of insurance proceeds as recovery for 2005 hurricane insurance claims. In 2006, we reached tentative settlements of two employment related civil class actions brought against us. We recorded, in 2006, pretax charges of $9.7 million (20 basis points) included in selling and administrative expenses for the estimated settlement liability for these matters. See note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional detail on these matters. In 2006, we recorded pretax income of $2.6 million (less than 10 basis points) in selling and administrative expenses upon receipt of our portion of the Visa/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement funds that compensate merchants for the excessive fees paid for certain Visa and MasterCard transactions. Seasonality We historically have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit being realized in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores, the timing of television and circular advertising, and the timing of certain holidays. We purchase substantial amounts of inventory and incur higher shipping and payroll costs as a percent of sales in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit by fiscal quarter: First Second Third Fourth Fiscal Year 2007 Net sales percentage of full year 24.2 % 23.3 % 22.1 % 30.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 18.0 14.1 9.6 58.3 Fiscal Year 2006 Net sales percentage of full year 23.0 % 22.3 % 22.1 % 32.6 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 12.7 4.3 1.4 81.6 20 Operating Strategy In August 2005, we introduced our operating strategy called the Whats Important Now (WIN) Strategy. The WIN Strategy is comprised of 3 distinctive phases: Discovery, Testing and Learning, and Execution. The Discovery phase (second half of 2005) included tactical decisions to improve near term performance along with the development of strategic changes to be implemented or tested during 2006. Throughout the Testing and Learning phase (2006), we implemented or tested several merchandising, marketing, and operational strategies to better understand our business future potential. With certain tactical changes made and the knowledge gained from testing and learning, we are now in the Execution phase (2007 through 2009). Our long term strategy is based upon results from the first 18 months of the WIN Strategy and encompasses a complete assessment of all areas of our operations in order to identify the key growth initiatives and strategic investments needed to improve the performance of our business. The Execution phase includes a strategic roadmap focused on expanding our operating profit rate, driving sustainable growth in earnings per share, and generating significant cash to reinvest in the business or to return to shareholders. The following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our WIN Strategy with respect to merchandising, real estate, and operating expenses. Merchandising We developed our merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per square foot and increasing gross margin dollars. Our customer surveys have found that brand name merchandise, the treasure hunt experience, price, value, and savings were most important to our customers. Certain elements of our merchandising strategy were tested and executed in 2006. Also, in 2006, we refined our detailed merchandising plans in order for each merchant to understand his or her targeted levels of closeout merchandise, engineered closeout merchandise (items that we often develop along with our vendors), and product categories that our customers expect us to consistently have in stock. Our objective is to maximize the amount of closeout merchandise which we believe provides the greatest value to our customers. We have communicated many of these expectations to our vendors so that they understand our expectations and can collaborate with us to get the desired types and quantities of merchandise to our stores. During the 2006 holiday season, we conducted additional customer surveys and learned the following: Over 80% of our customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without something specific in mind that they are looking for. Price dominates top of mind awareness and our customers look to us for value and savings. Almost one half of our customers surveyed said their shopping trips last 30 to 60 minutes, which we interpret as they are coming to us to shop the store and for the treasure hunt. One of the key elements to the success of our merchandising strategy has been the raise the ring strategy. The raise the ring strategy involves offering a merchandise mix to the customer that includes items with slightly higher average item retail sales price. One method used to accomplish this is to offer larger package or quantity sizes. For example, instead of offering an item for sale on a per piece basis, we may offer the same product in a package of three or six pieces. Another part of the raise the ring strategy involves offering types of merchandise that increase average item retail, based on our belief that as long as the value proposition is compelling, our customers are willing to purchase higher ticket merchandise from us. Based on our customer surveys, we believe our customers want high quality merchandise, which often results in high average item retail. The raise the ring strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores while positive comparable store sales were achieved. We expect to drive comparable store sales with both merchandising and marketing. From a merchandising perspective, we will continue to focus on raising the ring and offering top brand named merchandise. We expect to offer high quality merchandise at prices that represent good values, even if the sales prices are higher than what has traditionally been found in our stores. Our global sourcing team is expected to be key in improving quality and quantity of our import business in seasonal, furniture and some of the home and 21 hardlines businesses. We continue to evaluate how our stores are merchandised and, when appropriate, to redesign our stores to focus on capturing volume opportunities in categories that we believe have the potential to out perform other merchandise. Our marketing efforts continue to involve a mix of circulars, in store marketing, television, and online advertising. Many of the products we offer in the circulars are a result of the merchandising strategies discussed above. The planning and coordination that goes into these circulars improves their effectiveness and helped to drive sales, gross margin dollars, and the inventory turnover rate. We have developed better in store marketing strategies, such as improved signage, aimed at increasing total sales dollars from each customer. Our new signage was tested favorably during 2006 and was rolled out to all stores late in the fourth quarter of 2006. Lastly, we continue to market to our Buzz Club, with a free online membership and by aggressively signing up new members and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores. In 2005, as part of a review of our merchandising strategy, we: 1) closed our stand alone furniture stores; 2) executed a series of markdowns lowering in store inventory levels in certain categories and improving inventory turnover; and 3) exited the frozen food business. Real Estate As part of our WIN Strategy, we closed 174 stores during 2005, a significant number of which were underperforming. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the operating results of 130 of these closed stores were reclassified to discontinued operations in 2005 and all prior periods reported. See note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our discontinued operations. We have slowed our rate of new store openings and our strategy is more market focused and prioritized to our strongest markets in the Northwest, West, and South. We have allocated approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million in total to open new stores from 2007 through 2009. This level of expenditure is planned to result in an average of 15 new stores a year. During 2007, we opened a total of 7 new stores. While we would like to open more new stores, we continue to exercise prudence with respect to capital allocation, including avoiding overpaying for leased real estate in order to deliver store unit growth. Our strategy includes additional investments in a select number of our existing stores in order to improve operating efficiency. In 2007, we spent approximately $20 million to implement our new point of sale register system in approximately 700 of our stores. We expect that our remaining stores will receive the new point of sale register system in 2008 at an additional cost of approximately $20 million. In addition, in 2007, we spent approximately $5 million for store retrofits and merchandise fixtures at approximately 70 of our stores to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications. Retrofitting a store includes reorganizing the selling floor primarily by moving fixtures to improve the alignment of the selling floor with our merchandising and marketing efforts. We believe we have developed a store format that allows us the opportunity to get more merchandise out on the selling floor in some of our higher volume, small square footage stores, including opening full furniture departments in approximately one half of the 2007 store retrofits. In 2008, we plan on completing approximately 40 store retrofits, all of which will add a full furniture department. Operating Expenses Our goal is to continue to generate selling and administrative expense leverage. We have changed processes and the way we operate the business. We believe that changes we have made and continue to make in merchandising are the starting point to achieving our leverage goals. We have reduced inventory levels at our stores and our regional distribution centers. We attempt to flow product to our stores in optimal quantities and pack sizes in a timely manner. We have increased the percentage of acquired floor ready merchandise that arrives in our stores pre ticketed and conveniently packaged for efficient display and sale. These merchandising efforts and the favorable impact of our raise the ring strategy are expected to help us continue to leverage our store and distribution center operating expenses. Based on these efficiencies along with the new point of sale register system, we continue to evaluate how we schedule payroll hours in our stores as well as the appropriate staffing models. 22 With respect to distribution and outbound transportation expenses, we believe we have opportunities for further improvement in several areas. Furniture is different than our other merchandise categories because of the bulk of the product and how much can be shipped on a trailer. Historically, furniture has been shipped from different buildings and on different trailers because we did not have the capacity in our regional distribution centers. In the past, the majority of our stores received weekly shipments from a closeout truck from a regional distribution center and a separate furniture truck from one of our furniture distribution centers on a different day. This process was not efficient for our stores or distribution centers. Improvements in managing our inventory and turning our goods faster have created capacity in our regional distribution centers. This allows furniture to be handled through our regional distribution centers and combined with other merchandise which results in fewer shipments and trailers, more efficient unloading processes and less payroll hours needed at the store level. Additionally, we benchmarked all aspects of our transportation in an effort to find new ways to reduce expenses. As a result, we have improved our processes, including optimizing the timing of deliveries, and we have implemented a vendor compliance program that has generated transportation savings. We have also reduced our fleet size and changed our mix of carriers. In certain cases, we have found it to be less expensive overall to use one way carriers where we have historically used round trip carriers. While our cost per mile has increased, we have significantly reduced the number of miles required to deliver our merchandise. We have achieved cost savings related to changes to our health care administrator. In February 2007, we changed our third party network administrator, allowing us to offer our associates a wider network of providers, which in turn allows us to save money. During 2007 this change helped offset medical cost increases and lowered our cost as a percent of sales. In 2005, our review of our operating expenses resulted in personnel reductions in our general office, field operations, and distribution centers. Certain resources were realigned based on the 2005 store closings and further net store closures expected in the near term. Additionally, some redundancies between our closeout store operations and our furniture store operations were eliminated. Discontinued Operations We continue to incur exit related costs for some of the 130 stores we closed in 2005 that we have classified as discontinued operations, specifically on the stores where lease obligations remain. We also report certain activity related to our prior ownership of the KB Toys business in discontinued operations. See note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of all of our discontinued operations. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net Sales Net sales decreased 1.8% to $4,656.3 million in 2007 compared to $4,743.0 million in 2006. This net sales decrease of $86.7 million is principally due to sales made during the 53rd week in 2006 and lower store count in 2007, which were partially offset by a comparable store sales increase of 2.0%. Our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of 2007. This calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria. From a merchandise perspective, the Consumables, Furniture, and Seasonal were the best performing categories with comparable store sales increasing in the mid single digits range. Comparable store sales increases in these categories were partially offset by decreases in Home and Other. Consumables performed consistently throughout the year with positive comparable store sales across all departments. Furniture performed consistently throughout the first three quarters of 2007; however, recent trends in the fourth quarter were more challenging in part because in the fourth quarter we were up against a successful prior year launch of Serta mattresses and were transitioning between old and new styles of product in certain key classifications. Seasonal was driven by strength in lawn & garden, summer, and Christmas, which were partially offset by disappointing Halloween and harvest. Home category sales have been very soft since the first quarters positive performance. All Home departments except for domestics ended the year with negative comparable store sales. Within the Other category, the decrease in toy sales and toy comparable store sales was 23 partially offset by the impact from a couple of larger closeout deals, including a drugstore deal and a furniture deal. Similar to other retailers, our toy business was challenged in 2007 principally due to the negative publicity from certain high profile toy recalls. We manage our business based on one segment, broadline closeout retailing. During the first quarter of 2007, in connection with the completion of the internal re alignment of certain merchandising departments and classes between our divisional merchandising managers, we determined that the following six merchandise categories most directly match our internal management and reporting of merchandise net sales results: Consumables, Home, Furniture, Hardlines, Seasonal, and Other. See Item 1, Business of this Form 10 K for a more detailed description of each category. Effective for the first quarter of 2007, we use these six categories externally to report net sales information by each merchandise group in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Prior period amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Net sales by product category, net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in 2007 compared to 2006 were as follows: 2007 2006 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,339,433 28.8 % $ 1,317,095 27.8 % $ 22,338 1.7 % Home 783,047 16.8 842,974 17.8 (59,927 ) (7.1 ) Furniture 687,292 14.8 681,952 14.4 5,340 0.8 Hardlines 629,119 13.5 645,338 13.6 (16,219 ) (2.5 ) Seasonal 597,933 12.8 584,762 12.3 13,171 2.3 Other 619,478 13.3 670,927 14.1 (51,449 ) (7.7 ) Net sales $ 4,656,302 100.0 % $ 4,743,048 100.0 % $ (86,746 ) (1.8 )% Gross Margin Gross margin dollars decreased 2.7% to $1,840.3 million in 2007 compared to $1,891.4 million in 2006. The decline in gross margin by $51.1 million was principally due to a combination of lower net sales and a lower gross margin rate. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 39.5% in 2007 compared to 39.9% in 2006. This gross margin rate decrease of 40 basis points was primarily due to higher markdowns, a shift in the sales mix toward lower margin categories such as Consumables, from higher margin categories or departments, such as the Home category and the toys department, and higher accruals for shrink. Higher markdowns were attributable in part to slower selling categories and departments, such as the Home category and the toys department, and more promotional selling in Seasonal and Furniture. The factors decreasing the gross margin rate were partially offset by an improvement in the initial mark up of merchandise purchased in 2007 compared to purchases in 2006. This improvement in initial mark up is primarily attributed to our merchandising strategies as discussed in the above Merchandising section under Operating Strategy. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.5 turns in 2007 compared to 3.4 turns in 2006. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased 6.6% to $1,515.4 million in 2007 compared to $1,622.3 million in 2006. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32.5% in 2007 compared to 34.2% in 2006. In 2007 selling and administrative expenses were reduced by $5.2 million (10 basis points) of proceeds from the KB Toys bankruptcy trust (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) and $4.9 million (10 basis points) of insurance proceeds as recovery for 2005 hurricane insurance claims. In 2006, selling and administrative expenses included charges of $9.7 million (20 basis points) for the estimated settlement liability for the tentative settlements of two employment related civil class actions brought against us (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). In addition to these specific items, the following items contributed to the 170 basis point improvement in selling and administrative expense leverage: 1) the 2.0% increase in comparable store sales, which was above our expense leverage point; 2) a reduction in health and welfare plan expenses of $26.9 million driven by greater discounts resulting from 24 a change in the plans service provider effective February 1, 2007 and fewer plan participants, 3) a reduction in distribution and outbound transportation costs of $23.8 million, and 4) a reduction in store payroll and payroll related expense of $18.3 million. Distribution and outbound transportation costs, which were included in selling and administrative expenses (see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), decreased 10.7% to $198.3 million in 2007 compared to $222.1 million in 2006. Distribution and outbound transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.3% in 2007 compared to 4.7% in 2006. Distribution and outbound transportation cost savings have been achieved through certain management initiatives including, but not limited to, improvements in furniture distribution, more efficient scheduling of labor used in the distribution centers, lower health and welfare plan expense, as discussed above, and transportation initiatives aimed at optimizing the use of our transportation fleet and the increased usage of third party one way carriers. The higher use of third party one way carriers, which began late in the second quarter of 2007, has increased our cost per mile while decreasing the overall transportation cost as a result of fewer miles traveled. Store payroll continues to benefit from merchandising strategies such as raise the ring, acquiring more floor ready merchandise that has resulted in a reduction in payroll hours required to process fewer cartons, and improved distribution methods. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense for 2007 was $88.5 million compared to $101.3 million for 2006. The $12.8 million decrease was principally related to the decline in capital expenditures over the last 24 months compared to earlier fiscal years. The lower capital expenditures are principally related to opening seven stores in 2007 and 11 stores in 2006 compared to opening 73, 103, and 86 stores in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In addition, in 2006 and 2007, we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system, which was installed in approximately 700 of our stores as of February 2, 2008, and other items generally considered maintenance capital items for our distribution centers and stores. We expect to complete the installation of the new point of sale register system in all of our remaining stores in 2008. In 2006, upon the successful completion of a pilot program in 32 of our stores and the decision to move forward with the implementation of a new point of sale system in all of our stores, we reduced the remaining estimated service life on approximately $6.9 million of certain point of sale equipment. The impact of this service life reduction was to recognize approximately $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $4.1 million in 2007 as additional depreciation expense. The remaining $0.5 million is expected to be depreciated in 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $2.5 million in 2007 compared to $0.6 million in 2006. The $1.9 million increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average borrowings of $37.9 million in 2007 compared to average borrowings of $4.8 million in 2006. The higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of approximately 30.0 million shares of our common stock for $712.5 million under our publicly announced share repurchase programs. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income increased $1.9 million in 2007 to $5.2 million compared to $3.3 million in 2006. Because we began 2007 with cash and cash equivalents of $281.7 million, we were in an invested position throughout the first half of 2007. We invested primarily in money market type investments that are considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 36.8% for 2007 compared to 33.9% for 2006. The increase in 2007 was driven primarily by less benefit from valuation allowance reductions (relating to net operating loss deferred tax assets) and the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes. We anticipate our 2008 effective income tax rate to be within a range of 38.5% to 39.0%. The 2008 effective income tax rate is planned to be higher as we anticipate less benefit from valuation allowance reductions in 2008, less nontaxable municipal interest income in 2008 and higher income from continuing operations. 25 Discontinued Operations We recorded income from discontinued operations of $7.3 million in 2007 compared to $11.4 million in 2006. The income from discontinued operations in 2007 was principally comprised of the release of our KB bankruptcy lease obligation (as defined in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) of $6.6 million, net of tax, 2) the recognition of $1.1 million of proceeds, net of tax, from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for KB bankruptcy lease obligations and the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center (formerly owned by KB Toys) mortgage guarantee, and 3) exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases have not been terminated. The income from discontinued operations in 2006 was principally comprised of the partial release of our KB bankruptcy lease obligation of $8.7 million, net of tax, and the release of KB Toys related income tax and sales tax indemnification liabilities of $4.7 million, net of tax, which were partially offset by a loss on the sale of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center of approximately $1.4 million, net of tax and exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $1.6 million, net of tax, including a $0.7 million, pretax pension settlement charge and expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases had not been terminated. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net Sales Net sales increased 7.1% to $4,743.0 million in 2006 compared to $4,429.9 million in 2005. This net sales increase of $313.1 million was principally due to a 4.6% increase in comparable store sales and sales made during the 53rd week in 2006. From a merchandise perspective, the Consumables, Furniture, and Hardlines were the best performing categories. Within the Consumables category, sales of food and health and beauty products drove the increase which was partially offset by the decline in sales of frozen food, which we discontinued in 2005. Within the Furniture category, sales of upholstery and mattresses drove the increase. Within the Hardlines category, sales of electronics drove the increase. As previously discussed, effective for the first quarter of 2007, we use six categories externally to report net sales information by each merchandise group in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Prior period amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Net sales by product category, net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in 2006 compared to 2005, as reclassified, were as follows: 2006 2005 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,317,095 27.8 % $ 1,225,798 27.7 % $ 91,297 7.4 % Home 842,974 17.8 785,352 17.7 57,622 7.3 Furniture 681,952 14.4 599,664 13.5 82,288 13.7 Hardlines 645,338 13.6 587,304 13.3 58,034 9.9 Seasonal 584,762 12.3 575,374 13.0 9,388 1.6 Other 670,927 14.1 656,413 14.8 14,514 2.2 Net sales $ 4,743,048 100.0 % $ 4,429,905 100.0 % $ 313,143 7.1 % Gross Margin Gross margin dollars increased 9.2% to $1,891.4 million in 2006 compared to $1,731.7 million in 2005. We achieved our stated goal to increase gross margin dollars as gross margin improved by $159.7 million principally due to a combination of higher net sales and a slightly higher gross margin rate. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 39.9% in 2006 compared to 39.1% in 2005. This gross margin rate increase of 80 basis points was primarily due to an improvement in the initial mark up of merchandise purchased in 2006 compared to purchases in 2005. This improvement is primarily attributed to our merchandising strategies as previously discussed. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.4 turns in 2006 compared to 3.0 turns in 2005. 26 Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 1.6% to $1,622.3 million in 2006 compared to $1,596.1 million in 2005. While net sales increased $313.1 million, selling and administrative expenses increased only $26.2 million and as a result, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 34.2% in 2006 compared to 36.0% in 2005. The following items contributed to the 180 basis point improvement in selling and administrative expense leverage: 1) the 4.6% increase in comparable store sales, which was above our expense leverage point; 2) our raise the ring merchandising strategy which delivered higher sales results with fewer cartons processed by the distribution centers and stores; 3) reduction in general office and field operations headcount primarily due to the elimination of some redundancies between closeout and furniture store operations; and 4) various initiatives aimed at improving efficiency at our stores and distribution centers including tightly managed payroll budgets, the initiation of a vendor compliance program, and merchandising strategies aimed at getting merchandise delivered that is more efficiently able to be displayed on the selling floor, for example, pre ticketed items and improved packaging (ready to display packaging, palletized end cap displays, etc.). Some of the increases in selling and administrative expense components from 2005 to 2006 were bonus expense of $22.0 million, wage litigation charges of $9.7 million, utilities of $6.5 million, stock based compensation expense of $5.7 million, and asset impairment charges of $5.0 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in store hourly wages of $10.7 million, general office wages of $5.2 million, field operations cost of $4.2 million, and proceeds received as a result of the Visa/MasterCard antitrust settlement of $2.6 million. The bonus expense increase is due primarily to our improved financial performance in 2006 and compares to 2005 when no general office bonuses were paid. The wage litigation charges are discussed in more detail in note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Higher utilities costs are primarily a result of higher utility rates. Stock based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) (See note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and the achievement of a performance based target with respect to nonvested restricted stock awards granted in the first quarter of 2006. The asset impairment charges relate primarily to charges taken on certain underperforming stores that were opened in 2004 and 2005. Lower store hourly wages, even with the $313.1 million increase in sales, are a result of improved productivity in the stores primarily due to lower inventory levels at the stores and our raise the ring merchandising strategy. The decline in general office and field operations expenses was primarily a result of the reduction in headcount which included the elimination of some redundancies in the furniture and closeout operations. Distribution and outbound transportation costs, which were included in selling and administrative expenses (see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), decreased 0.8% to $222.1 million in 2006 compared to $223.8 million in 2005. Distribution and outbound transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.7% in 2006 compared to 5.1% in 2005. The 40 basis point decrease was primarily due to our raise the ring merchandising strategy which resulted in fewer cartons being processed through the distribution centers with higher carton values. In addition, our emphasis on improved inventory turnover led to lower inventory levels maintained in the distribution centers. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense for 2006 was $101.3 million compared to $108.7 million for 2005. The $7.4 million decrease was principally related to a declining amount of capital expenditures in 2005 and 2006. The lower capital expenditures are principally related to opening 11 stores in 2006 and a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development of a new point of sale register system and other items generally considered maintenance capital items for our distribution centers and stores in 2006. 2005 capital expenditures included capital related to the completion of reengineering of our Columbus, Ohio distribution center. Upon the successful completion of a pilot program in 32 of our stores and the decision to move forward with the implementation of a new point of sale system in all of our stores, we reduced the remaining estimated service life on approximately $6.9 million of certain point of sale equipment. The impact of this service life reduction was to recognize approximately $2.3 million of depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of 2006. The estimated remaining service life was based on our projected roll out schedule to all remaining stores, approximately one half in 2007 and one half in 2008. 27 Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 90.5% to $0.6 million in 2006 compared to $6.3 million in 2005. The $5.7 million decrease in interest expense was principally due to lower average borrowings of $4.8 million in 2006 compared to average borrowings of $139.9 million in 2005. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income increased $3.0 million in 2006 to $3.3 million compared to $0.3 million in 2005. Because we generated significant cash flow from our operations, we were in an invested position throughout the majority of 2006. We invested primarily in money market type investments that are considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 33.9% for 2006 compared to 24.8% for 2005. In 2006, we benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of our expectation of utilizing more net operating loss benefits and the resolution of certain income tax matters. The rate was lower in 2005 principally due to 1) proportionately larger jurisdictional losses in entities with higher marginal income tax rates, 2) lower overall income before income taxes, and 3) loss contingency activity partially offset by higher write down of deferred income tax assets as a result of state tax law changes. Discontinued Operations We recorded income from discontinued operations of $11.4 million in 2006 compared to loss from discontinued operations of $25.8 million in 2005. The income from discontinued operations in 2006 was principally comprised of 1) the partial release of our KB bankruptcy lease obligation (as defined in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) of $8.7 million, net of tax, and 2) the release of KB Toys related income tax and sales tax indemnification liabilities of $4.7 million, net of tax, partially offset by 1) a loss on the sale of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center (formerly owned by the KB Toys business) of approximately $1.4 million, net of tax and 2) exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $1.6 million, net of tax, including a $0.7 million, pretax pension settlement charge and expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases have not been terminated. We based the revision of the KB bankruptcy lease obligation on the number of demand notices that we had received from landlords and used information received from KB Toys, the bankruptcy trust, and our own lease records which date back to when we owned the KB Toys business. Additionally, we released the tax indemnification liabilities in light of information that we received as a result of our settlement discussions with the bankruptcy trustee and KB Toys in an attempt to resolve the tax indemnification claims. Our loss from discontinued operations in 2005 included $25.4 million, net of tax, primarily related to exit costs and 2005 results of operations of the 130 stores, $0.6 million, net of tax, of income for the reversal of liabilities associated with the KB Toys business, and $1.0 million, net of tax, associated with the write down of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center to fair value less selling cost, upon its classification as held for sale. Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital Resources On October 29, 2004, we entered into the $500.0 million Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to terminate on October 28, 2009. The proceeds of the Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain of our indebtedness. The pricing and fees related to the Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating. Loans made under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid by us without penalty. The Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens, and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of these 28 covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit, and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement. On December 22, 2006, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement in order to permit us to acquire investments rated by an additional rating agency. On October 25, 2005, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement in order to eliminate the impact on the covenant calculations of the charges related to the store closings discussed in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We were in compliance with our amended financial covenants under the Credit Agreement at February 2, 2008. The Credit Agreement permits, at our option, borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or the London InterBank Offering Rate plus applicable margin. The Credit Agreement also permits, as applicable, borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by us and the lenders. Whenever our liquidity position requires us to borrow funds under the Credit Agreement, we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis. The daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position, which is generally driven by: 1) cash inflows such as cash or credit card receipts collected from stores for merchandise sales and other miscellaneous deposits; and 2) cash outflows such as check clearings for the acquisition of merchandise and payroll, wire and other electronic transactions, and other miscellaneous disbursements. In addition to revolving credit loans, the Credit Agreement includes a $30.0 million swing loan sub limit, a $50.0 million bid loan sub limit, and a $150.0 million letter of credit sub limit. At February 2, 2008, we had $163.7 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 4.6% as of February 2, 2008. At February 3, 2007, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, after taking into account the outstanding borrowings and the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $58.4 million, were $277.9 million at February 2, 2008. We utilize our credit facility, as necessary, to provide funds for ongoing and seasonal working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, and other expenditures. In addition, our credit facility is used to provide letters of credit for various operating and regulatory requirements, a significant portion of which consists of letters of credit required as a result of our self funded insurance programs. Given the seasonality of our business, the amount of borrowings under the Credit Agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors, including our operating financial performance, the time of year, and our need to increase merchandise inventory levels prior to the peak selling season. We anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than $350.0 million through the end of May 2008. Liquidity The primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operations and, as necessary, borrowings under the Credit Agreement. At February 2, 2008, working capital was $390.8 million. We generated $307.9 million from operating activities in 2007, driven by net income of $158.5 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $83.1 million, improved accounts payable leverage of $66.3 million, and a decrease in inventories of $10.2 million. These increases in cash were partially offset by a decline in accrued operating expenses of $25.4 million. The increase in accounts payable was driven by our efforts to improve terms with our vendors. At February 2, 2008, to minimize the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the dollar amount of outstanding checks was greater than cash deposited at our disbursement bank, and as a result, we reported the unfunded checks as accounts payable. The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower store count at the end of the 2007. The decline in accrued operating expenses included lower insurance reserves, primarily due to the new health and welfare plan provider in 2007 that makes claim payments in a more timely manner, lower accrued bonus primarily due to the lower rate of achievement of general office and store performance objectives in 2007, and lower sales taxes payable primarily driven by the 53rd week in fiscal 2006. 29 Cash provided by operating activities was $381.5 million during 2006 and resulted primarily from net income of $124.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $95.6 million, a reduction in inventories of $77.9 million, timing associated with current income taxes of $44.1 million, and improved accounts payable leverage of $24.0 million. Lower inventories were principally due to our continued efforts to improve the inventory turnover rate and to keep store merchandise fresh. Our income tax position was favorable because we received income tax refunds in 2006 related primarily to the overpayment of taxes in 2005 and had income taxes payable of approximately $28.0 million at the end of 2006. We improved our accounts payable leverage principally by extending payment terms to foreign vendors. Cash used in investing activities was $58.8 million in 2007 and $30.4 million in 2006 and was primarily comprised of capital expenditures of $60.4 million in 2007 and $35.9 million in 2006. Capital expenditures in 2007 were principally costs related to the installation of the new point of sale register system in approximately 700 of our stores, costs for approximately 70 store retrofits to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications, and seven new store openings. Capital expenditures in 2006 were primarily related to opening 11 new stores, software development cost for our new point of sale system, and various distribution center, store, or lease related requirements. Capital expenditure requirements in 2008 are anticipated to range between $90 million and $95 million, focused on completing the installation of the new point of sale register system in our stores, development and licensing cost associated with our SAP for Retail system implementation, the completion of approximately 40 additional store retrofits, approximately 20 new store openings, and other projects aimed at maintaining existing property and equipment. Cash used in financing activities was $493.7 million in 2007 driven by $712.5 million of share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase programs, which were partially offset by $163.7 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, $35.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and $19.8 million for the excess tax benefit derived from share based awards. Cash used in financing activities was $71.1 million in 2006 and consisted primarily of share repurchases under the $150.0 million share repurchase program, which were partially offset by $57.5 million of stock option exercise proceeds, $13.3 million of proceeds from selling one of our owned store properties, and $11.9 million for the excess tax benefit derived from the exercise of stock options by employees. See Item 5 of this Form 10 K for more information regarding our share repurchase programs. We continue to believe that we have, or, if necessary, have the ability to obtain adequate resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures. Additionally, management is not aware of any current trends, events, demands, commitments, or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on our capital resources or liquidity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at February 2, 2008: Payments Due by Period (1) Less than More than Total 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years 5 years (In thousands) Long term debt obligations (2) $ 163,700 $ $ 163,700 $ $ Operating lease obligations (3) (4) 878,429 247,974 359,875 185,089 85,491 Capital lease obligations (4) 2,497 923 1,432 142 Purchase obligations (4) (5) 747,874 540,713 91,626 61,799 53,736 Other long term liabilities (6) 52,528 16,474 6,495 11,180 18,379 Total contractual obligations (7) $ 1,845,028 $ 806,084 $ 623,128 $ 258,210 $ 157,606 (1) The disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report. Those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate; consequently, the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur. Variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include, but are not limited to: the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated 30 expiration; fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation; the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report; fluctuations in third party fees, governmental charges, or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors; and the exercise of renewal options under, or the automatic renewal of, contracts that provide for the same. (2) Long term debt obligations consist of the borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $58.4 million at February 2, 2008. Approximately $57.3 million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit; accordingly, they have been excluded from this table. The remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in Purchase Obligations. For a further discussion, see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (3) Operating lease obligations include, among other items, leases for retail stores, warehouse space, offices, and certain computer and other business equipment. The future minimum commitments for store and warehouse space operating leases are $657.9 million. For a discussion of leases, see note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of common area maintenance costs (CAM), real estate taxes, and property insurance. In connection with our store lease obligations, we estimated that future obligations for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance were $208.9 million at February 2, 2008. We have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Those assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: use of historical data to estimate our future obligations; calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold; and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data. The remaining lease obligation of $11.6 million relates primarily to operating leases for computer and other business equipment. (4) For purposes of the lease and purchase obligation disclosures, we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date, and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension. Where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term, we disclosed our minimum commitment under such obligation, such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term, due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing leases. (5) Purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at $399.1 million, the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of February 2, 2008. In addition, we have a purchase commitment for future inventory purchases totaling $198.9 million at February 2, 2008. While we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment, for purposes of this tabular disclosure, we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods, as purchases that will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation. The remaining $149.9 million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation, information technology, print advertising, and other store security, supply, and maintenance commitments. (6) Other long term liabilities include $23.8 million for expected pension plan contributions, our $13.9 million obligation related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, $12.3 million for unrecognized tax benefits, and $2.5 million for closed store lease termination costs. Pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans). We have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions. We have included unrecognized tax benefits of $4.6 million for payments expected in 2008 and $7.7 million of FIN No. 48 timing related items anticipated to 31 reverse in 2008. Unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $17.6 million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments. Our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms. (7) The obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities, guarantees, and indemnities related to KB Toys. For further discussion, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of February 2, 2008, we have KB Lease Obligations, as that term is defined in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, with respect to approximately 52 open KB Toys stores. In 2007, we entered into an agreement with KB Toys and various Prentice Capital entities (owners/affiliates of KB Toys) which we believe provides for a cap of our liability under the existing KB Toys guaranteed store leases and an indemnification from the Prentice Capital entities with respect to any renewals, extensions, modifications, or amendments of these guaranteed leases which could potentially add incremental liability to us beyond the date of the agreement, which was September 24, 2007. Under these agreements, KB Toys is required to update us periodically with respect to the status of any remaining leases which they believe we have guaranteed. In addition, we have the right to request the net asset value of Prentice Capital Offshore in order to monitor the sufficiency of their indemnification. Because these remaining guarantees were issued prior to January 1, 2003, they are not subject to the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. However, we will recognize a liability if a loss in connection with any of the KB Lease Obligations becomes probable and reasonably estimable. See note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of KB Toys matters. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, judgments, and assumptions, including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates, judgments, and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and management believes the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to the accurate reporting of our results of operations and financial position. See note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policies. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period. Under the average cost retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics, at its current retail selling value. Inventory retail selling values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department. Cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on each departments average cost to retail ratio for beginning inventory and for current fiscal year purchase activity. The average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving 32 inventory, the estimated allowance for shrinkage, and the estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and prior or future gross margin. These estimates are based on historical experience and current information. Cost reductions in inventory valuation as a result of permanent sales markdowns, which are typically related to end of season clearance events, are recorded as a charge to cost of sales in the period of managements decision to initiate sales price reductions with the intent not to return the price to regular retail. Promotional markdowns are typically related to specific marketing efforts with respect to products maintained continuously in our stores or products that are only available in limited quantities but represent substantial value to our customers. Promotional markdowns are principally used to drive higher sales volume during a defined promotional period, and were recorded as a charge to net sales in the period the merchandise is sold. Factors considered in the estimate of the reduction to cost of inventory for permanent markdowns at the end of each reporting period include current and anticipated demand for the merchandise, customer preferences, quantity of merchandise, age of the merchandise, and seasonal trends such as customer buying patterns, competitive pressures, weather, and the desire to keep merchandise in the stores fresh and inventory turning. The inventory allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories and charged to cost of sales and is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period. Such estimates are based on our historical experience and current year experience based on a sample of recent physical inventory results. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, we have loss prevention programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage. The inventory allowance for excess or obsolete inventory is estimated based on a review of our aged inventory and takes into account any items that have already received a cost reduction as a result of the permanent markdown process discussed above. We estimate an allowance for excess or obsolete inventory based on historical sales trends, age and quantity of product on hand, and anticipated future sales. If any of the estimates, judgments, or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory are incorrect, the actual inventory value on our consolidated balance sheet and the gross margin on our consolidated statement of operations could materially differ from the reported results. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment. In order to determine if impairment indicators are present on store property and equipment, we review historical operating results at the store level. Generally, all other property and equipment are reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level. Impairment is recorded if impairment indicators are present and if the carrying values of the long lived assets exceeded their anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows. Our assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods. We estimated the fair value of our long lived assets using readily available market information for similar assets. When material, we classify the results of operations of closed stores to discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the stores have been (or will be) eliminated from ongoing operations and we no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the operations associated with the stores after closure. We generally meet the second criteria on all closed stores as, upon closure, operations ceased and we have no continuing involvement. To determine if cash flows have been (or will be) eliminated from ongoing operations, we evaluate a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to, proximity to remaining open stores and estimated sales migration from the closed store to any stores remaining open. Estimated sales migration is based on our historical experiences of our sales migration upon opening or closing a store in a similar market. For purposes of reporting the operations of stores meeting the criteria for discontinued operations, we reported net sales, gross margin, and related operating costs that are directly related to and specifically identifiable with respect to those stores operations as discontinued operations. Certain corporate level charges, such as general office cost, field operations, national advertising, fixed distribution costs, and interest cost are not allocated to discontinued operations because we believe that these costs are not specific to the stores operations. 33 Share Based Compensation We adopted the fair value recognition provisions for stock options of SFAS No. 123(R), Accounting for Share Based Compensation, on January 29, 2006, under the modified prospective method, in which the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) are to be applied to new awards and to previously granted awards that were not fully vested on the effective date. The modified prospective method does not require restatement of previous years financial statements. We used the short cut method to determine our beginning excess tax benefit pool. Upon adoption, the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost is reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We value and expense stock options with graded vesting as a single award with an average estimated life over the entire term of the award. The expense for options with graded vesting is recorded straight line over the vesting period. The fair value of nonvested restricted stock awards is measured at the grant date and is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense for all share based awards is recognized in selling and administrative expense. We use a binomial model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted on or after February 1, 2004. The binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield rate, risk free rate, contractual term of the option, the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life, and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option. Expected volatility is based in part on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares. The risk free rate is based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of the grant. The dividend yield on our common shares is assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no immediate plans to do so. The expected life is determined from the binomial model. The model incorporates exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data. Compensation expense for performance based nonvested restricted stock awards is recorded based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria. An estimated target achievement date is determined at the time of the award based on historical and forecasted performance of similar measures. We monitor the projected achievement of the performance targets at each reporting period and make prospective adjustments to the estimated vesting period when our internal models indicate that the estimated achievement date differs from the date being used to amortize expense. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the adequacy and need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income (loss) before income taxes, the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income (loss), changes in the income tax laws (which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year), subsequent recognition, de recognition and or measurement of an uncertain tax benefit in accordance with FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, changes in a deferred tax valuation allowance, and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates. 34 In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, which became effective at the beginning of 2007. FIN No. 48 is an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires us to recognize in our financial statements the impact of an income tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained, based on the technical merits of the position. The recognition and measurement guidelines of FIN No. 48 were applied to all of our material income tax positions as of the beginning of 2007, resulting in an increase in our tax liabilities of $2.2 million with a corresponding decrease to beginning retained earnings for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, and the related accruals and deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Pension Actuarial valuations are used to calculate the estimated expenses and obligations for our pension plans. Inherent in the actuarial valuations are several assumptions including discount rate and expected return on plan assets. We review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return. Our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date. In making this estimate, we review rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits. This process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of Aa or better. The expected long term rate of return on assets is derived from detailed periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes, risks (standard deviations), and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long term, prospective rate of return. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for 2007 is 5.9%. A 0.5% decrease in the discount rates would increase net periodic pension cost by $0.1 million. The long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in 2007 is 8.5%. A 1.0% decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by $0.5 million. Insurance and Insurance related Reserves We are self insured for certain losses relating to property, general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical and dental benefit claims, a portion of which is funded by employees. We purchase stop loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposure in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity. Management makes estimates, judgments, and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially based calculations, including but not limited to, estimated health care cost trends, estimated lag time to report and pay claims, average cost per claim, network utilization rates, network discount rates, and other factors. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a 4% discount rate, while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted. To the extent that actual claim costs vary from the estimates we have recorded and reflected in our consolidated financial statements, future earnings could be materially impacted. 35 Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies including legal actions, lease termination obligations on closed stores, lease indemnification obligations on KB Toys stores, and other claims arising out of the normal course of our business. In connection with such claims and contingencies, we estimate the likelihood and amounts, where possible to do so, of any potential obligation using managements judgment. Management uses various internal and external specialists to assist in the estimating process; however, the ultimate outcome of the various claims and contingencies could be materially different from managements estimates, and adjustments to income could be required. With respect to the lease termination obligations and lease indemnification obligations, we consider the remaining minimum lease payments, estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained, and other potentially mitigating factors. As market conditions or other factors change, the estimate of the obligations could be materially different. We continually evaluate the adequacy of our recorded obligations for claims and contingences based on current information, including settlement amounts of individual lease obligations compared to recorded contractual obligations. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable), or, if it is probable but an estimate is not determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, because it is not permissible to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable, in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial, for example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement). Revenue Recognition We recognize sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Sales are recorded net of discounts and estimated returns and excludes any sales tax. The reserve for merchandise returns is estimated based on our prior return experience. We sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift card balances and our gift cards do not expire. We recognize sales revenue from gift cards when: (1) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (2) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage income of $0.3 million is included in the 2007 net sales on our consolidated statements of operations. The liability for the unredeemed cash value of gift cards is recorded in accrued operating expenses. We offer price hold contracts on selected furniture merchandise. Revenue for price hold contracts is recognized when the customer makes the final payment and takes possession of the merchandise. Amounts paid by customers under price hold contracts are recorded in accrued operating expenses until a sale is consummated. Lease Accounting Rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease. We recognize minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred incentive rent. We also receive tenant allowances, which are recorded in deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. In order to properly recognize rent expense on our leases, we must properly identify the lease term. The lease term is the minimum contractually obligated period over which we have control of the property. Our leases generally have renewal options that extend beyond the original minimum lease period; however, these lease option periods are ignored for the purpose of calculating straight line rent or amortizing any deferred rent. From time to time we modify lease terms with existing or new landlords, including but not limited to, modifications due to a change in ownership of the property, modifications requiring us to change locations within a shopping center, early terminations, and other modifications. In these cases, we assess whether a significant modification has occurred and if so, determine the appropriate accounting for the applicable components of deferred rent associated with that lease. 36 Our leases generally obligate us for our applicable portion of real estate taxes, CAM, and property insurance that has been incurred by the landlord with respect to the leased property. We maintain accruals for our estimated applicable portion of real estate taxes, CAM, and property insurance incurred but not settled at each reporting date. We estimate these accruals based on historical payments made and take into account any known trends. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that actual costs incurred by landlords and the resulting payments by us may be higher or lower than the amounts we have recorded on our books. Certain of our leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at the lease inception date. Contingent rent includes rent based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level. Contingent rent is excluded from minimum rent and is included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48. FIN No. 48 is an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires us to recognize in our financial statements the impact of an income tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained, based on the technical merits of the position. The recognition and measurement guidelines of FIN No. 48 were applied to all of our income tax positions as of the beginning of 2007, resulting in an increase in our tax liabilities of $2.2 million with a corresponding decrease to beginning retained earnings for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value when required by GAAP. SFAS No. 157 does not create or modify any GAAP requirements to apply fair value accounting. The standard provides a single definition of fair value that is to be applied consistently for all accounting applications and also generally describes and prioritizes according to reliability the methods and inputs used in valuations. SFAS No. 157 prescribes additional disclosures regarding the extent of fair value measurements included in a companys financial statements and the methods and inputs used to arrive at these values. SFAS No. 157 is effective on a prospective basis for us in the first quarter of 2008. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the required application of SFAS No. 157 to non financial assets until the beginning of fiscal 2009. We expect no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity from adopting this statement. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 will be effective at the beginning of 2008. We expect no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity from adopting this statement. In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FIN 48 1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48. FSP FIN 48 1 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN 48 1 was effective retroactively to February 4, 2007. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which changes the accounting for business combinations and their effects on the financial statements. SFAS No. 141(R) will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, and amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 requires entities to report non controlling interests in subsidiaries as equity in their consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 37 Commitments For a discussion of commitments, refer to note 3, note 5, note 10, and note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on investments that we make from time to time and on borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We had no fixed rate long term debt at February 2, 2008. An increase of 1% in our variable interest rate on our outstanding debt would not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 38
