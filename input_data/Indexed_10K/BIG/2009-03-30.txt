ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. Please refer to Item 1A of this Form 10 K for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years with 52 weeks and some with 53 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 was comprised of 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2008 and 2007 each were comprised of 52 weeks. Operating Results Summary The following are the results from 2008 that we believe are key indicators of our operating performance when compared to our operating performance in 2007. Comparable store sales for stores open at least two years at the beginning of 2008 increased 0.5%. Sales per selling square foot were $160 in 2008 and $158 in 2007. Net sales declined 0.2% as we operated an average of 1,356 stores throughout 2008 compared to 1,370 average stores throughout 2007. Gross margin as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points to 40.0% of sales in 2008 from 39.5% of sales in 2007. Gross margin dollars were higher by 0.9%. Average inventory levels were lower throughout 2008 compared to 2007 and, combined with the 0.5% increase in comparable store sales, resulted in a higher inventory turnover rate of 3.6 times in 2008 compared to 3.5 times in 2007. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales increased 30 basis points to 32.8% of sales from 32.5% of sales in 2007. Depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased 20 basis points to 1.7% of sales in 2008 from 1.9% of sales in 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to $1.89 per share in 2008 compared to $1.47 per share in 2007. Cash provided by operating activities was $211.1 million in 2008 compared to $307.9 million in 2007. Our total inventory per average store was flat at the end of 2008 compared to 2007. Our accounts payable leverage declined at the end of 2008 as a result of a shift in our merchandise mix to higher purchases from vendors which have shorter payment terms, many of whom offer cash discounts. The 2008 decline in our accounts payable leverage compares to the increase in leverage during 2007. Additionally, we paid income taxes of $92.4 million in 2008 compared to $65.8 million in 2007. We acquired 2.2 million of our common shares in 2008 under our publicly announced repurchase program for a total cost of $37.5 million. 17 The following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales: 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 60.0 60.5 60.1 Gross margin 40.0 39.5 39.9 Selling and administrative expenses 32.8 32.5 34.2 Depreciation expense 1.7 1.9 2.1 Operating profit 5.5 5.1 3.5 Interest expense (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.0 ) Interest and investment income 0.0 0.1 0.1 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 5.4 5.1 3.6 Income tax expense 2.0 1.9 1.2 Income from continuing operations 3.3 3.2 2.4 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (0.1 ) 0.2 0.2 Net income 3.3 % 3.4 % 2.6 % See the discussion and analysis below for additional details of the specific components of our operating results comparing the 2008 results to 2007 and the 2007 results to 2006. Selling and administrative expenses in 2007 were reduced by $5.2 million (10 basis points), pretax, for proceeds we received from the KB Toys bankruptcy trust (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) and $4.9 million (10 basis points), pretax, for insurance proceeds we received as recovery for 2005 hurricane insurance claims. In 2006, we reached tentative settlements of two employment related civil class actions brought against us. We recorded, in 2006, pretax charges of $9.7 million (20 basis points) included in selling and administrative expenses for the estimated settlement liability for these matters. See note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional detail on these matters. In 2006, we recorded pretax income of $2.6 million (less than 10 basis points) in selling and administrative expenses upon receipt of our portion of the Visa/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement funds that compensate merchants for the excessive fees paid for certain Visa and MasterCard transactions. Seasonality As discussed in Item 1. Business, under the Seasonality caption, our financial results fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on various factors such as timing of new or closed stores, timing and extent of advertisements and promotions, and timing of holidays. We expect that the Christmas holiday selling season will continue to result in a significant portion of our sales and operating profits. If our sales performance is significantly better or worse during this time frame, we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results. The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit for 2008 and 2007 by fiscal quarter: First Second Third Fourth Fiscal Year 2008 Net sales percentage of full year 24.8 % 23.8 % 22.0 % 29.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 22.8 17.1 7.9 52.2 Fiscal Year 2007 Net sales percentage of full year 24.2 % 23.3 % 22.1 % 30.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 18.0 14.1 9.6 58.3 18 Operating Strategy In August 2005, we introduced our operating strategy called the Whats Important Now Strategy (WIN Strategy). The WIN Strategy is comprised of three distinct elements: merchandising, real estate, and cost structure. Over the last three years, our strategy has followed a roadmap focused on expanding our operating profit rate (which increased from 0.6% in 2005 to 5.5% in 2008), driving growth in earnings per share from continuing operations (which increased from $0.14 per diluted share in 2005 to $1.89 per diluted share in 2008), and generating significant cash provided by operating activities to reinvest in the business or to return to shareholders ($900 million in aggregate share repurchases in 2006, 2007 and 2008 under publicly announced share repurchase programs). In 2009, we expect our 1) operating profit rate to be flat to down 30 basis points based on our projections that comparable store sales will be flat to down 2% and the gross margin rate will be similar to 2008, 2) earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $1.75 to $1.90, and 3) cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures of approximately $80 to $85 million to be approximately $145 million. The following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our WIN Strategy with respect to merchandising, real estate, and cost structure. The 2008 Compared To 2007 section below provides additional discussion and analysis of the impact of these strategies on our financial performance and the assumptions and expectations upon which we are basing our guidance for our future results. Merchandising We developed our merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per selling square foot (which increased from $146 per square foot in 2005 to $160 per square foot in 2008) and increasing gross margin dollars (which increased from $1,731.7 million in 2005 to $1,857.4 million in 2008). Our customer surveys have confirmed that brand name merchandise at extreme value, the treasure hunt experience, price, value, and savings are most important to our customers. The treasure hunt experience is how our customers refer to the experience of shopping our stores looking for their favorite brands of merchandise at great values as our assortment of branded merchandise continually changes based on the availability of closeout merchandise. In 2006, we refined our detailed merchandising plans to improve the understanding of each of our merchants regarding his or her targeted levels of 1) closeout merchandise, 2) engineered closeout merchandise (items that we develop along with our vendors), and 3) merchandise categories that we consistently stock. Our objective is to maximize the amount of closeout merchandise which we believe provides the greatest value to our customers. We have communicated many of these expectations to our vendors so that they understand our expectations and work with us to offer the desired types and quantities of merchandise in our stores. We constantly evaluate our mix of closeout merchandise and merchandise that we consistently stock. Our future net sales results could fluctuate materially depending on the availability, timing, and or size of closeout deals. One of the key elements to the success of our merchandising strategy over the past few years has been to offer our customers better quality merchandise, better values, and more prominent brand name products. This strategy involved offering a merchandise mix to the customer that included items with slightly higher average item retail sales price. One method used to accomplish this was to offer larger package or quantity sizes. For example, instead of offering an item for sale on a per piece basis, we offered the same product in a package of multiple pieces. Another part of the strategy involved offering merchandise with higher average item retails, based on our belief that as long as the value proposition is compelling, our customers are willing to purchase higher ticket merchandise from us. Based on our customer surveys, our customers want higher quality merchandise, which often results in higher average item retail. This strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores and achieved positive comparable store sales. From a merchandising perspective in 2009, our goal is to continue to provide unmatched value, better quality, and continue to increase the recognized brand name merchandise as a percentage of the overall merchandise assortment. Because of our long standing relationships with our vendor partners, we anticipate brand name closeout merchandise deals will continue to be available to us to purchase at savings that we can pass on to our customers. In 2009, we expect our major merchandise categories will remain the same as prior years but the percentage of business by category may fluctuate from time to time based on customer demand and the availability of compelling deals that we are able to source and offer in our stores. 19 Our marketing efforts involve a mix of printed circulars, in store marketing, television, and online advertising. Many of the products we offer in our circulars are a result of the merchandising strategies discussed above. The planning and coordination that goes into these circulars improves their effectiveness and helps to drive sales, gross margin dollars, and the inventory turnover rate. Much of our marketing is based on information that we have learned about our customers, principally through customer surveys. Based on this information, we believe over 80% of our customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without a specific item or brand in mind to buy. Value dominates top of mind awareness as our customers look to us for savings. Almost one half of our customers surveyed said their shopping trips last over 30 minutes, which we interpret as them coming to shop our stores for the treasure hunt. We have improved, and expect to continue to develop, our in store signage and merchandising displays and arrangements. Lastly, we continue to market to our Buzz Club, by offering a free online membership and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores. From a marketing perspective in 2009, we plan to increase the focus on our messages of value and savings available to customers who shop our stores. Our new in store signage, print, and television advertising will emphasize these messages. The marketing efforts and in store presentation will focus on merchandise categories that we believe our customers are most interested in, such as Consumables and Hardlines, and that offer particularly great value to the customer. From a store operations perspective, we have initiated a Ready for Business program, which is aimed at improving our net sales by focusing on the consistency and timeliness of in store merchandising execution and generally improving customer service. The program also focuses on improvements in our employee training programs and hiring practices, and implementation of our merchandising strategies including presentation of merchandise in our stores. We believe that improvements made in these areas of our stores will result in a better shopping experience for our customers and, in turn, may result in higher net sales for us. Real Estate In 2006, we slowed our rate of new store openings based on our recent new store performance and the belief that the real estate locations available to us in the marketplace were too expensive and as such the return on investment would not be satisfactory to our shareholders. During 2006 through 2008, we opened a total of only 39 new stores (11 in 2006, 7 in 2007, and 21 in 2008). During the same timeframe, we closed 101 existing stores (37 in 2006, 29 in 2007, and 35 in 2008) for various reasons including lack of profitability, proposed new lease terms where rents were escalating and landlords were unwilling to renegotiate terms, or relocating the store to a better or potentially more productive location. Throughout 2008, economic conditions in the United States deteriorated leading many retailers to close significant numbers of stores that were similar in size to our stores and were located in markets of interest to us. Many of these same retailers have scaled back planned future capital expenditures, including their future store opening plans. These developments, along with other economic factors, have led to real estate opportunities at favorable lease rates, the availability of higher quality locations, and the availability of more locations. As a result of improvements in our store productivity and overall profitability over the last three years and the softening of the real estate market, we expect to grow our store base in 2009 for the first time in the last five years. We plan to open 45 new stores and close approximately 40 stores in 2009. The openings are expected to be throughout the country with the largest concentration of new stores in the Northeast, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, California, Oregon, and Washington. These markets have historically been some of the more difficult areas to find store leases in our price range. Additionally, in 2009 we plan to test a smaller (approximately 20,000 gross square feet) store to better understand the impact that carrying an edited assortment of merchandise in a smaller store has on sales productivity and profitability. We believe there are a number of store locations available to us in this size range. If successful, a smaller store could represent additional growth opportunities for us over the long term. We expect to test the small store concept during 2009 before making any determination about future inclusion of this store concept in our long term strategy. We believe we have opportunities with respect to the lease options included in our existing store leases. As stated in Item 2. Properties, of this Form 10 K, we have 247 store leases that expire in 2009. We expect to close approximately 40 of these stores, some of which have not performed to our expectations, some of which have no more lease renewal options and we expect the landlord to choose a different tenant, and some of which 20 we anticipate exiting by our choice in favor of relocating the store to a new location in a nearby area. For our remaining 200 plus store locations, we expect to exercise our renewal option or negotiate more favorable lease renewal terms sufficient enough to enable us to achieve an acceptable return on our investment. Our strategy has included the following additional investments in our existing fleet of stores in order to improve operating efficiency: In 2007 and 2008, we invested approximately $38 million to implement our new point of sale register system in all of our existing stores with the expected benefits to include more timely and accurate sales and inventory information, improved customer service through faster speed at checkout, lower repair and maintenance costs, and improved labor efficiency through the use of hand held technology. In 2007 and 2008, we invested approximately $7 million in store retrofits and new merchandise fixtures at approximately 110 of our stores to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications. With respect to the 110 store retrofits that were completed in 2007 and 2008, stores were chosen based on several factors including, but not limited to, store size, whether the store had a full furniture department or was limited to a lesser offering of furniture, overall sales volume, and comparable store sales trend. As a result, we refreshed these 110 stores, improved their financial performance in the aggregate, and, we believe, improved the customer shopping experience. Based on the results, we have determined that we get the best return on our investment when we add a full furniture department to a store. Nearly 1,100 of our stores have a full furniture department and the balance of our 1,339 stores is space constrained. Therefore, any future store retrofit activity of this type is expected to be minimal. However, it is likely that we will continue to maintain and invest in our existing stores and will test new store layouts or merchandise presentation ideas in the future. While we believe the completed retrofits have positively impacted our operating results with a minor impact on our liquidity, we do not believe that the results of the retrofits represent a material factor in our detailed discussion of changes in net sales, gross margin, selling and administrative expenses, or depreciation expense. In 2009, we will be testing a new store layout in the Columbus, Ohio market and in a group of approximately 60 test locations across the country. The layout test aims to improve the ease of shopping our stores. It features Consumables more prominently in our store and improves the sight lines within the store. The initial customer reaction indicates that the store seems better organized, is cleaner, and has improved lighting, wider aisles, and generally presents merchandise more effectively. We expect the new layout to be implemented in the Columbus, Ohio market by the end of the first quarter of 2009 and the additional 60 test stores will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2009. We intend to monitor and evaluate performance of these layout test stores during 2009 before making any determination about the future rollout of the new layout to additional stores. An additional investment we intend to pursue during 2009 involves our food department (which is a part of our Consumables category). The Food Refresh program emphasizes cleanliness and merchandise presentation and it includes new or refinished fixtures in approximately one half of our stores with new signage and shelf labeling. Based on feedback from our customers, we believe improved cleanliness, better fixtures, and dedicated associate staffing to maintain a better merchandise presentation, should instill customer confidence in the quality and freshness of our food merchandise. Cost Structure Our goal is to continue to generate expense leverage (lower depreciation and selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales). We believe that several operational changes we have made, which we continue to refine, have significantly contributed to the achievement of our leverage goals. Some of the operational changes that we have made include: Reducing inventory levels at our stores and regional distribution centers; Buying and distributing merchandise to our stores in optimal quantities and pack sizes to minimize handling in our distribution centers and stores; Timing receipt of merchandise in stores close to the expected display dates in order to avoid excessive handling of merchandise; 21 Increasing the percentage of merchandise that arrives in our stores pre ticketed and pre packaged for efficient display and sale; Refining our staffing and payroll scheduling models in our stores; and Implementing several initiatives which lowered our distribution and outbound transportation expenses. With respect to distribution and outbound transportation expenses, we have taken advantage of several opportunities for improvement. Distribution of furniture differs from our other merchandise categories in part due to the bulk of the product and the impact of that bulk on shipments. Prior to July 2008, furniture was distributed to our stores from our two furniture distribution centers. The majority of our stores received a weekly shipment of merchandise from a regional distribution center one day and a separate shipment of furniture from one of our furniture distribution centers on a different day. This process was inefficient for our stores and distribution centers. Improvements in managing our inventory and turning our inventory faster have lowered our inventories and created capacity in our regional distribution centers. Beginning in July 2008, furniture is distributed to many of our stores through four of our regional distribution centers and combined with other merchandise which results in fewer shipments and trailers, more efficient unloading processes and less payroll hours needed at the store level. We continue to operate a furniture distribution center in Redlands, California, which distributes furniture to many of our West Coast stores. Additionally, we benchmark all aspects of our transportation in an effort to find new ways to reduce expenses. As a result, we have improved our processes, including optimizing the timing of deliveries, and we have implemented a vendor compliance program that has generated savings. We also have reduced our trailer fleet size and changed our mix of carriers. In certain cases, we have found it to be less expensive overall to use third parties to make one way shipments where we have historically used our own fleet for round trips. While our cost per mile has increased, we have significantly reduced the number of miles required to deliver our merchandise. Discontinued Operations We continue to incur exit related costs for some of the 130 stores we closed in 2005 that we have classified as discontinued operations, specifically on the stores where lease obligations remain. We also report certain activity related to our prior ownership of the KB Toys business in discontinued operations. See note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of all of our discontinued operations. 2008 Compared to 2007 Net Sales As previously discussed, we report net sales information for six merchandise categories in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Net sales by merchandise category, as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 were as follows: 2008 2007 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,410,383 30.4 % $ 1,339,433 28.8 % $ 70,950 5.3 % Home 713,103 15.4 783,047 16.8 (69,944 ) (8.9 ) Furniture 698,276 15.0 687,292 14.8 10,984 1.6 Hardlines 646,563 13.9 629,119 13.5 17,444 2.8 Seasonal 585,025 12.6 597,933 12.8 (12,908 ) (2.2 ) Other 591,933 12.7 619,478 13.3 (27,545 ) (4.4 ) Net sales $ 4,645,283 100.0 % $ 4,656,302 100.0 % $ (11,019 ) (0.2 )% Net sales decreased $11.0 million (0.2%) to $4,645.3 million in 2008 compared to $4,656.3 million in 2007. There were fewer open stores in 2008 which caused a decrease of $34.0 million partially offset by our comparable store sales increase of 0.5%, which increased sales by $23.0 million. Our comparable store sales 22 are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of 2008. This calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria. Following a comparable store sales increase of 3.1% in the first half of 2008, sales trends softened resulting in a comparable store sales decrease of 1.9% in the second half of 2008. We believe that our comparable store sales results in the third and fourth quarters were in part due to the worsening general economic trends. As a result of the current general economic trends, consumers may elect to forego purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news. Reduced consumer spending may reduce our net sales. Based on sales trends in January and February 2009, and on current general economic trends, we expect comparable store sales to be flat to a decline of 2% in 2009. From a merchandise perspective, the Consumables, Hardlines, and Furniture categories net sales increased while net sales of Home, Other, and Seasonal declined. Consumables continued its consistent sales growth throughout the year. As the year progressed, consumers chose to seek out value when shopping for the everyday household use items that we offer in our Consumables business. We believe our strategy of offering name brands at competitive prices has led to this consistently positive net sales performance in the Consumables category. The Hardlines category increase in net sales was driven by the availability in the second half of 2008 of multiple closeout deals containing higher ticket electronics, highlighted by significant values on items such as popular video games and personal computer laptops from national brand manufacturers. The Furniture category increase was driven by sales of mattresses, which were attributable to the customer response throughout the year especially when promotional pricing was coupled with holiday events such as the Labor Day mattress promotion. The Home category net sales consistently underperformed throughout the year continuing a trend which began in the first half of 2007. We believe our customers have elected to defer purchases of this type of merchandise; however, we have new merchant management in place for this category and intend to focus our efforts on the brand names and value propositions that have been successful in other merchandise categories. The Other category sales decline is primarily due to lower sales of toys principally in the latter half of the year, when toys represent a relatively larger portion of our total net sales. The lower toys sales results were partially offset within the Other category by higher sales driven by closeout deals of licensed kids underwear during the first half of the year. The Seasonal category net sales produced positive results in the first half of the year for lawn & garden and summer merchandise; however, the second half of the years net sales underperformed due to lower comparable store sales for Christmas, Halloween, and harvest. Because the Christmas selling season represents a higher portion of the total years sales in this category, the decline in Christmas merchandise sales drove the category sales lower for the year. Gross Margin Gross margin dollars increased $17.1 million (0.9%) to $1,857.4 million in 2008 compared to $1,840.3 million in 2007. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 40.0% in 2008 compared to 39.5% in 2007. The increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to the higher gross margin rate, which increased gross margin dollars by approximately $21 million. Partially offsetting the higher gross margin rate was lower net sales of $11.0 million, which reduced gross margin dollars by approximately $4 million. The gross margin rate increase of 50 basis points was primarily due to higher initial markup on merchandise and favorable shrink results partially offset by higher markdowns and the mix impact of our higher net sales in merchandise categories, such as Consumables, that have lower gross margin rates. The improvement in initial markup was due in part to a drugstore liquidation deal, a furniture closeout from a large national brand, and an overall favorable deal environment for closeout merchandise. In addition, initial markup was higher in 2008 due to our Home Event, which we offered in our stores principally during the first half of the year. The Home Event merchandise was included in the Furniture category and Home category. Shrink was lower principally due to favorable physical inventory results. Higher markdowns were attributable in part to planned markdowns associated with a drugstore liquidation deal, a furniture closeout from a large national brand, and our Home Event merchandise. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.6 turns in 2008 compared to 3.5 turns in 2007. Based on historical results and current economic conditions, we expect our 2009 gross margin rate to be approximately 40.0%. Based on the current general economic trends, our vendors may be negatively impacted by insufficient availability of credit to fund their operations or insufficient demand for their products, which may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Additionally, the general economic conditions have caused a higher level of uncertainty of our forecasted sales results, and thus, demand for our merchandise could differ materially from our expectation causing us to under or over buy certain merchandise, which may result in customer dissatisfaction or excessive markdowns required to liquidate the merchandise. 23 Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $8.5 million (0.6%) to $1,523.9 million in 2008 compared to $1,515.4 million in 2007. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally caused by an increase in medical plan expenses of $9.7 million, higher share based compensation expense of $5.5 million, the 2007 partial recovery of the HCC Note investment of $5.2 million (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the HCC Note), the 2007 reduction in selling and administrative expenses due to the receipt of insurance proceeds for 2005 hurricane claims of $4.9 million, and higher store utilities of $3.4 million. These items were partially offset by a $17.1 million decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs and a $15.8 million decrease in store payroll costs. The increase in medical plan expenses is principally due to higher paid claims. The increase in share based compensation is principally due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) under the modified prospective method of accounting in the first quarter of 2006 and our acceleration of vesting of stock options in the fourth quarter of 2005. We expect share based compensation expense to increase in 2009 due to the continued increase in unvested options expected to be outstanding; however, this impact is expected to level off after 2009 because the stock options that have been granted since 2006 vest over a four year period. Higher store utilities costs were driven by colder weather this winter and higher average commodity rates throughout the majority of 2008. The decline in distribution and outbound transportation costs is a result of lower inventory levels, fewer cartons processed through our distribution centers (as discussed above), more one way trips to the stores resulting in higher shipping cost per mile but fewer miles traveled and, beginning in July 2008, the integration of our Ohio furniture distribution operation into four of our regional distribution centers. Partially offsetting these favorable distribution and outbound transportation costs was the impact of higher diesel fuel prices. Store payroll is lower due to fewer stores and employees and fewer cartons of merchandise resulting from the $11.0 million decline in net sales and the merchandise strategy that involves offering merchandise with slightly higher average item retails. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32.8% in 2008 compared to 32.5% in 2007. Excluding the impact of the $5.2 million partial recovery of the HCC Note and the receipt of hurricane insurance proceeds of $4.9 million, both of which reduced 2007 selling and administrative expenses, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Our future selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales rate is dependent upon many factors including our level of net sales, our ability to implement additional efficiencies, principally in our store and distribution center operations, and fluctuating commodity prices, such as diesel fuel, which directly affects our outbound transportation cost. Based on our expectation of flat to a decline of 2% for comparable store sales in 2009, we expect selling and administrative expenses to increase in 2009 as a percent of sales, principally as a result of the impact of our fixed costs such as rent, employee salaries, insurance, and benefits over flat to lower sales dollars. As stated in the discussion of our operating expense strategy above, we expect lower distribution and outbound transportation costs in the first half of 2009, when compared to the first half of 2008, due to the integration of the Ohio furniture distribution center into four of our regional distribution centers. The full quarterly effect of this reduction in cost did not occur until the third quarter of 2008. We believe we have additional opportunities for future reductions in selling and administrative expenses in store operations and supply chain, which may offset other inflationary factors. During 2008, we experienced volatility in the price of diesel fuel, which drove our costs higher than expected for the first three quarters and lower than expected for the fourth quarter. Based on current diesel fuel costs, we expect this element of our selling and administrative expenses will be lower in the first quarter of 2009 because the current price of diesel fuel is lower than the price of diesel fuel in the first quarter of 2008. We expect the de leveraging impact of flat to negative 2% comparable store sales to be greater than the favorable impact of the furniture integration and the lower diesel fuel cost factors in 2009, resulting in our guidance of higher selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales for 2009. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense decreased $9.9 million (11.2 %) to $78.6 million in 2008 compared to $88.5 million for 2007. The decrease was principally related to the five year service life store remodel program assets that were placed in service in 2002 and 2003 and a lower level of capital expenditures in 2006 and 2007. The lower capital expenditures in 2006 and 2007 are principally related to opening seven stores in 2007 and 11 stores in 2006 24 compared to opening 73, 103, and 86 stores in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In addition, in 2006 and 2007, we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system, which was installed in approximately 700 stores in 2007 and in all of our remaining stores in 2008. As a result of the installation of the new point of sale register system, we reduced the estimated remaining service life on our old register system, effective the fourth quarter of 2006. The impact of this service life reduction was to recognize $4.1 million in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2008 as additional depreciation expense associated with the old cash registers. For 2009, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $80 million to $85 million. Using this assumption and the run rate of depreciation on our existing property and equipment, we expect 2009 depreciation expense to be $70 million to $75 million, which would represent a decline from the $78.6 million of depreciation expense in 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $2.8 million to $5.3 million in 2008 compared to $2.5 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average borrowings of $151.8 million in 2008 compared to average borrowings of $37.9 million in 2007. The higher average borrowings caused interest expense to be higher by approximately $4 million. The higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase programs. Our average effective interest rate of 3.5% in 2008 was lower than our average effective interest rate of 6.6% in 2007. The decrease in the average effective interest rate decreased our interest expense by approximately $1 million in 2008. The lower interest rate was due to a decrease in LIBOR, the base interest rate available to us under the 2004 Credit Agreement. We anticipate lower average borrowings in 2009 as we began 2009 with borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement of $61.7 million, which was $102 million lower than the borrowings outstanding at the beginning of 2008. In addition, we expect cash provided by operating activities to be $225 million to $230 million, which is in excess of cash used for investing activities (capital expenditures) of $80 million to $85 million. In 2009, we expect to enter into a new bank credit agreement to replace the 2004 Credit Agreement. Because interest rate credit spreads have widened since we entered into the 2004 Credit Agreement, we may pay higher interest rates in the future under a new bank credit agreement; however, the current LIBOR rate, which is a base rate available to us under the 2004 Credit Agreement and expected to be available to us under a new bank credit agreement (prior to the application of the applicable credit spread), is approximately 4% lower than the peak LIBOR rate in 2008. We do not expect the higher credit spread under the new bank agreement to have a material adverse effect on our operating results in 2009. We expect interest expense to be lower in 2009 than 2008 because the estimated impact of the lower average borrowings is greater than the estimated impact of the higher interest rates. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income decreased $5.1 million in 2008 to $0.1 million compared to $5.2 million in 2007. The decline in interest and investment income was caused by the reduction in funds available to invest in 2008 compared to 2007. Our average invested amount in 2008 was $3.6 million compared to $130.4 million in 2007. The decline in funds available for investment was caused by the $750 million of share repurchases under our 2007 Share Repurchase Programs during the period March 2007 through February 2008. In 2007, we invested primarily in money market type investments that were considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds. We did not hold any investment balances at the end of 2008. We expect to have higher average invested amounts in 2009 as result of the lower debt levels and expected cash provided by operating activities. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 38.0% for 2008 compared to 36.8% for 2007. The net increase in 2008 was driven by a decrease in nontaxable municipal interest income, the increase in the valuation allowance on unrealized capital losses (versus a net decrease in the valuation allowance in 2007), and a change in the jurisdictional earnings mix, partially offset by the settlement of certain income tax matters. We anticipate our 2009 effective income tax rate to be within a range of 38.0% to 39.0%. 25 Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations was $3.3 million, net of tax, in 2008 compared to income from discontinued operations of $7.3 million, net of tax in 2007. The 2008 loss from discontinued operations of $3.3 million, net of tax, was comprised of $3.0 million, net of tax, for the KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligation (as defined in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and $0.3 million, net of tax, for exit related costs on the remaining 2005 closed stores which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. KB Toys declared bankruptcy again in December 2008. As a result of this bankruptcy filing, KB Toys rejected 31 store leases for which we believe we have an indemnification obligation. Based on the lease data for these 31 stores and using our prior experience with these matters, we estimated a KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligation of $3.0 million, net of tax. The income from discontinued operations in 2007 was principally comprised of 1) the release of our KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations of $6.6 million, net of tax, 2) the recognition of $1.1 million of proceeds, net of tax, from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations and the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center (formerly owned by KB Toys) mortgage guarantee, and 3) exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases have not been terminated. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net Sales Net sales by merchandise category, as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in 2007 compared to 2006 were as follows: 2007 2006 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,339,433 28.8 % $ 1,317,095 27.8 % $ 22,338 1.7 % Home 783,047 16.8 842,974 17.8 (59,927 ) (7.1 ) Furniture 687,292 14.8 681,952 14.4 5,340 0.8 Hardlines 629,119 13.5 645,338 13.6 (16,219 ) (2.5 ) Seasonal 597,933 12.8 584,762 12.3 13,171 2.3 Other 619,478 13.3 670,927 14.1 (51,449 ) (7.7 ) Net sales $ 4,656,302 100.0 % $ 4,743,048 100.0 % $ (86,746 ) (1.8 )% Net sales decreased 1.8% to $4,656.3 million in 2007 compared to $4,743.0 million in 2006. This net sales decrease of $86.7 million is principally due to $76.2 million of sales made during the 53rd week in 2006 combined with lower net sales of $95.2 million resulting from fewer open stores, partially offset by a comparable store sales increase of 2%, which increased net sales by $84.7 million. From a merchandise perspective, Consumables, Furniture, and Seasonal were the best performing categories with comparable store sales increasing in the mid single digits range. Comparable store sales increases in these categories were partially offset by decreases in Home and Other. Consumables performed consistently throughout 2007 with positive comparable store sales across all departments. We believe Consumables experienced these results because our merchants continued to acquire widely recognized brand name merchandise that offered tremendous value to the customer. Furniture performed consistently throughout the first three quarters of 2007; however, sales trends in the fourth quarter were more challenging in part because we were transitioning between old and new styles of merchandise in upholstery and case goods and a successful launch of Serta mattresses occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. Seasonal was driven by strength in lawn & garden, summer, and Christmas, which was partially offset by disappointing Halloween and harvest sales. This was the second year in a row of favorable Christmas results. Our lawn & garden and summer business drove the favorable Seasonal category performance in the first half of 2007. The net sales of the Seasonal category in 2007 exemplify results produced by our merchandising strategy, as the quality and value proposition has increased significantly and the average item retail price has increased as well. This supports one of the assumptions in our merchandising strategy that customers are willing to pay for quality and great value when they shop our stores. Home category sales were very soft following the positive performance in the first quarter of 2007. All Home departments except for domestics ended 2007 with negative comparable store sales. Within the Other category, the decrease in toy comparable store sales was 26 partially offset by the impact from larger closeout deals, including a drugstore liquidation deal and a furniture deal. Similar to other retailers, our toy business was challenged in 2007 principally due to the negative publicity from certain high profile toy recalls. Merchandise from the drugstore liquidation deal was in about 400 of our stores and was very similar to a drugstore deal that we had in 2006. The furniture deal was an opportunity for us to offer branded furniture in about 1,100 of our stores, just in time for the tax refund selling season, which historically is the highest volume period for sales of furniture. The merchandise from the furniture deal was largely sold by the end of the first quarter of 2008. Our future net sales results could fluctuate materially depending on the availability, timing, and or size of closeout deals. Gross Margin Gross margin dollars decreased 2.7% to $1,840.3 million in 2007 compared to $1,891.4 million in 2006. The decline in gross margin by $51.1 million was principally due to a combination of lower net sales of $86.7 million and a lower gross margin rate of 39.5% in 2007 compared to 39.9% in 2006. The decline in net sales reduced gross margin dollars in 2007 by approximately $34 million while the gross margin percentage of net sales decline of 40 basis points reduced gross margin by approximately $17 million. This gross margin rate decrease of 40 basis points was primarily due to higher markdowns, a shift in the sales mix toward lower margin categories, such as Consumables, from higher margin categories or departments, such as the Home category and the toys department, and higher accruals for shrink. Higher markdowns were attributable in part to slower selling categories and departments, such as the Home category and the toys department, and more promotional selling in Seasonal and Furniture. The factors decreasing the gross margin rate were partially offset by an improvement in the initial markup of merchandise purchased in 2007 compared to purchases in 2006. This improvement in initial markup is primarily attributed to our merchandising strategies as discussed in the above Merchandising section under Operating Strategy. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.5 turns in 2007 compared to 3.4 turns in 2006. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased $106.9 million (6.6%) to $1,515.4 million in 2007 compared to $1,622.3 million in 2006. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32.5% in 2007 compared to 34.2% in 2006. In 2007, selling and administrative expenses were reduced by $5.2 million (10 basis points) of proceeds from the KB Toys bankruptcy trust (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) and $4.9 million (10 basis points) of insurance proceeds as recovery for 2005 hurricane insurance claims. In 2006, selling and administrative expenses included charges of $9.7 million (20 basis points) for the estimated settlement liability for the tentative settlements of two employment related civil class actions brought against us (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). In addition to these specific items, the following items contributed to the 170 basis point improvement in selling and administrative expense leverage: 1) the 2.0% increase in comparable store sales, which was above our expense leverage point; 2) a reduction in health and welfare plan expenses of $26.9 million driven by greater discounts resulting from a change in the plans service provider effective February 1, 2007 and fewer plan participants, 3) a reduction in distribution and outbound transportation costs of $23.8 million, and 4) a reduction in store payroll and payroll related expense of $18.3 million. Distribution and outbound transportation costs, which are included in selling and administrative expenses (see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), decreased 10.7% to $198.3 million in 2007 compared to $222.1 million in 2006. Distribution and outbound transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.3% in 2007 compared to 4.7% in 2006. Distribution and outbound transportation cost savings have been achieved through certain management initiatives including, but not limited to, improvements in furniture distribution, more efficient scheduling of labor used in the distribution centers, lower health and welfare plan expense, as discussed above, and transportation initiatives aimed at optimizing the use of our transportation fleet and the increased usage of third party one way carriers. The higher use of third party one way carriers, which began late in the second quarter of 2007, has increased our cost per mile while decreasing the overall transportation cost as a result of fewer miles traveled. Store payroll continues to benefit from merchandising strategies such as acquiring more floor ready merchandise that has resulted in a reduction in payroll hours required to process fewer cartons and improved distribution methods. 27 Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense declined $12.8 million (12.6%) to $88.5 million for 2007 compared to $101.3 million for 2006. The decrease was principally related to the decline in capital expenditures over the last 24 months compared to earlier fiscal years. The lower capital expenditures are principally related to opening seven stores in 2007 and 11 stores in 2006 compared to opening 73, 103, and 86 stores in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. For additional discussion and analysis of our real estate strategy, see the discussion above in the Overview section of MD&A. In addition, in 2006 and 2007, we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system, which was installed in approximately 700 of our stores as of February 2, 2008, and other items generally considered maintenance capital items for our distribution centers and stores. In 2006, upon the successful completion of a pilot program in 32 of our stores and the decision to move forward with the implementation of a new point of sale system in all of our stores, we reduced the remaining estimated service life on approximately $6.9 million of certain point of sale equipment. The impact of this service life reduction was to recognize approximately $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $4.1 million in 2007 as additional depreciation expense on the old cash registers. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $1.9 million to $2.5 million in 2007 compared to $0.6 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average outstanding borrowings of $37.9 million in 2007 compared to average outstanding borrowings of $4.8 million in 2006. The higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of approximately 30.0 million shares of our common stock for $712.5 million under our publicly announced share repurchase programs. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income increased $1.9 million in 2007 to $5.2 million compared to $3.3 million in 2006. Because we began 2007 with cash and cash equivalents of $281.7 million, we were in an invested position throughout the first half of 2007. We invested primarily in money market type investments that are considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 36.8% for 2007 compared to 33.9% for 2006. The increase in 2007 was driven primarily by less benefit from valuation allowance reductions (relating to net operating loss deferred tax assets) and the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes. Discontinued Operations We recorded income from discontinued operations of $7.3 million in 2007 compared to $11.4 million in 2006. The income from discontinued operations in 2007 was principally comprised of 1) the release of our KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations (as defined in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) of $6.6 million, net of tax, 2) the recognition of $1.1 million of proceeds, net of tax, from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations and the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center (formerly owned by KB Toys) mortgage guarantee, and 3) exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases have not been terminated. The income from discontinued operations in 2006 was principally comprised of the partial release of our KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations of $8.7 million, net of tax, and the release of KB Toys related income tax and sales tax indemnification liabilities of $4.7 million, net of tax, which were partially offset by a loss on the sale of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center of approximately $1.4 million, net of tax and exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $1.6 million, net of tax, including a $0.7 million pretax pension settlement charge and expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases had not been terminated. 28 Capital Resources and Liquidity The primary sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations and, as necessary, borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, and operating profit margins. Our net sales are typically highest during the nine weeks of Christmas selling season (during our fourth fiscal quarter). Generally our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter. We meet those needs typically with borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement, which terminates on October 28, 2009. At January 31, 2009, working capital was $355.8 million, which included $61.7 million for the current maturities of obligations under the 2004 Credit Agreement. Global capital and credit markets have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we believe that our operating cash flow, together with the 2004 Credit Agreement, will be adequate to meet current operating, investing and financing needs. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to replace, renew, extend or modify the 2004 Credit Agreement beyond its October 2009 termination date on commercially acceptable terms. We expect to have a new bank credit agreement by the end of the second quarter of 2009; however, we expect the cost of borrowing under the new bank credit agreement will be higher than the 2004 Credit Agreement and our borrowing capacity may be less than the $500 million currently available to us under the 2004 Credit Agreement. Cash provided by operating activities declined in 2008 to $211.1 million from $307.9 million in 2007 and $381.5 million in 2006. While operating profit margins have expanded from 2006 to 2008, these improvements were more than offset with working capital changes. During 2006 through 2008, our inventories declined resulting in cash provided by operations of $99.5 million. The majority of the decline in inventories occurred in 2006 and increased our 2006 cash from operations by $77.9 million. In 2007 and 2008 the inventory decline only resulted in $10.2 million and $11.3 million of cash from operations, respectively. The decline in inventories was driven by lower average store inventory and lower store count each year. The decline in average store inventory was more pronounced in 2006 as a result of our merchandising and operating strategies that resulted in an improved turnover rate of our inventories (which increased from 3.0 turns in 2005 to 3.4 turns in 2006) along with delayed timing of merchandise replenishments. Comparatively, during 2006 through 2008, our accounts payable increased resulting in cash provided by operations of $66.0 million. Our accounts payable leverage was most pronounced in 2007 when we benefited from an increase of $66.3 million in accounts payable. The increase in accounts payable in 2007 was driven by our efforts to improve our terms with our vendors. Accounts payable declined in 2008 principally due to lower inventory in 2008 compared to 2007, and a shift in our merchandise mix to purchases from vendors with shorter payment terms, many of whom offer us discounts. Our cash paid for income taxes was $35.7 million, $65.8 million and $92.4 million during 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The increases in income taxes paid were a direct result of higher operating profits and partly impacted by the timing of required tax payments relative to the fiscal years in which these profits were earned. Additionally, in 2007, we benefited from larger tax deductions caused by our employees exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. In 2008, we contributed $11.0 million to the Pension Plan. These contributions were made principally as a result of the decline in market value of the Pension Plans investments resulting from the general economic conditions. We do not expect to have any required contributions to the Pension Plan in 2009; however, we may choose to make discretionary contributions. Based on assumptions about our 2009 operating performance that we have discussed above in MD&A, we expect cash provided by operating activities to be approximately $225 million to $230 million in 2009. However, based on the current general economic conditions, consumers may elect to defer or forego purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news. Reduced consumer spending may reduce our net sales, which could lower our profitability and limit our ability to convert merchandise inventories to cash. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2008 to $88.2 million from $58.8 million in 2007 and $30.4 million in 2006. These changes were caused by the increase in capital expenditures each year. In 2006, our capital expenditures were limited principally to maintenance type capital related to various store, distribution center, and lease related requirements, as well as capital related to opening 11 new stores, and software development costs for our new point of sale register system. In 2007, our capital expenditures were higher principally due to the installation of the new point of sale register system in approximately 700 of our stores and for approximately 70 store retrofits to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications. In 2008, we completed the installation of new cash registers in all of our stores and capital expenditures were 29 higher than the prior year principally as a result of licensing and development associated with our SAP for Retail system implementation, the acquisition of two store properties that we were previously leasing and 21 new store openings. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million to $85 million in 2009, comprised principally of maintenance capital of approximately $40 million, real estate capital of approximately $20 million driven by our plan to open 45 new stores, and other capital of $20 million to $25 million which includes, among other things, our continued software development of the SAP for Retail system. Cash used in financing activities was driven by the repurchase of shares of our common stock under various share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors. We acquired $150.0 million, $712.5 million and $37.5 million of our outstanding common shares in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively under these programs. The common share repurchases were funded with cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement. Our net borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement have fluctuated during the past three years. In 2006, we repaid our beginning of the year outstanding borrowings of $5.5 million and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $281.7 million. In 2007, principally due to the $712.5 million of shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs, we ended the year with outstanding borrowings of $163.7 million. During 2008, we paid $102 million to reduce our outstanding borrowings and ended the year with $61.7 million outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the 2004 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain of our indebtedness. The pricing and fees related to the 2004 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating. A downgrade in our credit rating could raise our cost of borrowing under the 2004 Credit Agreement. Loans made under the 2004 Credit Agreement may be prepaid by us without penalty. The 2004 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens, and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the 2004 Credit Agreement, which would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2004 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit, and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants under the 2004 Credit Agreement, as amended, at January 31, 2009. The 2004 Credit Agreement permits, at our option, borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or the London InterBank Offering Rate plus applicable margin. The 2004 Credit Agreement also permits, as applicable, borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by us and the lenders. Whenever our liquidity position requires us to borrow funds under the 2004 Credit Agreement, we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis. The daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position, which is generally driven by the following components of our operations: 1) cash inflows such as cash or credit card receipts collected from stores for merchandise sales and other miscellaneous deposits; and 2) cash outflows such as check clearings for the acquisition of merchandise, payroll and other operating expenses, wire and other electronic transactions for merchandise purchases, income and other taxes, employee benefits, and other miscellaneous disbursements. In addition to revolving credit loans, the 2004 Credit Agreement includes a $30.0 million swing loan sub limit, a $50.0 million bid loan sub limit, and a $150.0 million letter of credit sub limit. We had borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement of $61.7 million and $163.7 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 1.3% at January 31, 2009 and 4.6% at February 2, 2008. The borrowings available under the 2004 Credit Agreement, after taking into account the outstanding borrowings and the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $53.2 million, were $385.1 million at January 31, 2009. We use the 2004 Credit Agreement, as necessary, to provide funds for ongoing and seasonal working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, and other expenditures. In addition, we use the 2004 Credit Agreement to provide letters of credit for various operating and regulatory requirements, a significant portion of which consists of letters of credit required as a result of our self funded insurance programs. Given the seasonality of our business, the amount of borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors, including our operating financial performance, the time of year, and our need to increase merchandise inventory levels prior to the peak selling season. We anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than $125 million through the end of May 2009. 30 As discussed further in this Form 10 K, Item 1A. Risk Factors, the recent events that have occurred in the financial and credit markets continue to add a high level of uncertainty to factors which may affect our results of operations, capital resources, and liquidity, as well as credit availability to our vendors and customers. Based in part on discussions we have had with our key banking relationships, we currently believe that we have the ability to obtain financing beyond the termination of the 2004 Credit Agreement. Based on current market conditions and discussions that we have had with our key banking relationships, we may not be able to replace the entire $500 million of availability with a new agreement. However, we expect to be able to obtain a sufficient level of financing such that our normal operations are not impacted. Because interest rate credit spreads have widened since we entered into the 2004 Credit Agreement, we may pay higher interest rates in the future under a new bank credit agreement; however, the current LIBOR rate, which is a base rate available to us under the 2004 Credit Agreement and expected to be available to us under a new bank credit agreement (prior to the application of the applicable credit spread), is approximately 4% lower than the peak LIBOR rate in 2008. We do not expect the higher credit spread under the new bank agreement to have a material adverse effect on our operating results in 2009. Based on historical and planned financial results, we believe that we have or, if necessary, have the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing and seasonal working capital requirements, proposed capital expenditures, new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Other than the recent events that have occurred in the financial and credit markets and the scheduled termination of the 2004 Credit Agreement in October 2009, we are not currently aware of any other trends, events, demands, commitments, or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on our capital resources or liquidity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at January 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period (1) Less than More than Total 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years 5 years (In thousands) Obligations under bank credit facility (2) $ 61,700 $ 61,700 $ $ $ Operating lease obligations (3) (4) 887,709 251,168 365,309 199,646 71,586 Capital lease obligations (4) 6,389 2,758 3,301 330 Purchase obligations (4) (5) 716,449 549,347 88,653 59,076 19,373 Other long term liabilities (6) 53,745 14,714 10,364 11,467 17,200 Total contractual obligations (7) $ 1,725,992 $ 879,687 $ 467,627 $ 270,519 $ 108,159 (1) The disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report. Those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate; consequently, the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur. Variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include, but are not limited to: the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration; fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation; the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report; fluctuations in third party fees, governmental charges, or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors; and the exercise of renewal options under, or the automatic renewal of, contracts that provide for the same. (2) Obligations under bank credit facility consist of the borrowings outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $53.2 million at January 31, 2009. Approximately $49.5 million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit; accordingly, they have been excluded from this table. The remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in Purchase Obligations. For a further discussion, see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 31 (3) Operating lease obligations include, among other items, leases for retail stores, warehouse space, data center, offices, and certain computer and other business equipment. The future minimum commitments for store, data center, office, and warehouse space operating leases are $663.5 million. For a discussion of leases, see note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of common area maintenance costs (CAM), real estate taxes, and property insurance. In connection with our store lease obligations, we estimated that future obligations for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance were $215.8 million at January 31, 2009. We have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Those assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: use of historical data to estimate our future obligations; calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for particular leasehold; and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data. The remaining lease obligation of $8.4 million relates primarily to operating leases for computer and other business equipment. (4) For purposes of the lease and purchase obligation disclosures, we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date, and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension. Where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term, we disclosed in the table our minimum commitment under such obligation, such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term, due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing leases. (5) Purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at $410.2 million, the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of January 31, 2009. In addition, we have a purchase commitment for future inventory purchases totaling $167.4 million at January 31, 2009. While we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment, for purposes of this tabular disclosure, we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods, as purchases that will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation. The remaining $138.8 million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation, information technology, print advertising, energy procurement, and other store security, supply, and maintenance commitments. (6) Other long term liabilities include $30.2 million for expected pension plan contributions, our $11.0 million obligation related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, $11.6 million for unrecognized tax benefits, and $0.9 million for closed store lease termination costs. Pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans). We have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions. We have included unrecognized tax benefits of $3.8 million for payments expected in 2009 and $7.8 million of FIN No. 48 timing related items anticipated to reverse in 2009. Unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $24.4 million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments. Our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms. (7) The obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities, guarantees, and indemnities related to KB Toys. For further discussion, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements For a discussion of the KB Bankruptcy Lease Obligations, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Because the KB Toys business filed for bankruptcy again in December 2008 and liquidated all of its store operations, we accrued a contingent liability on our balance sheet in the amount of $5.0 million for 31 KB Toys 32 store leases for which we may have an indemnification or guarantee obligation. Because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability, our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, judgments, and assumptions, including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates, judgments, and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period. The average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear slow moving inventory, the estimated allowance for shrinkage, and the estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and prior or future gross margin. These estimates are based on historical experience and current information. When management determines the salability of merchandise inventories is diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal trends. Timing of holidays within fiscal periods, weather, and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year. The inventory allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories, charged to cost of sales, and calculated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period. Such estimates are based on our historical and current year experience based on a sample of recent physical inventory results. Independent physical inventory counts are taken at each store once a year, and typically the majority of these counts occur during January through April. Because only a sampling of our stores are counted prior to making our fiscal year end shrink estimate, we rely on the results of these sample stores along with our historical results to estimate our fiscal year end shrink accrual. During the first fiscal quarter, the majority of the physical inventories are completed and actual results are recorded on a store by store basis. In addition, we evaluate our go forward shrink accrual rate based on the results of the completed physical inventories. At January 31, 2009, a 10% difference in our shrink reserve would have affected gross margin, operating profit and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $5 million. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, we have loss prevention programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage. 33 Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment. We perform annual impairment reviews of our long lived assets at the store level. When we perform the annual impairment reviews, we first determine which stores had impairment indicators present. We use actual historical cash flows to determine which stores had negative cash flows in each of the past two years (on a rolling basis). For each store with two years of negative cash flows, we obtain future cash flow estimates based on operating performance estimates specific to each stores operations that are based on assumptions currently being used to develop our company level operating plans. If the net book value of a stores long lived assets is not recoverable by the expected future cash flows of the store, we estimate the fair value of the stores assets and recognize an impairment charge for the excess net book value of the stores long lived assets over their fair value. The fair value of store assets is estimated based on information available in the marketplace for similar assets. We recognized impairment charges of $0.1 million, $0.8 million, and $7.7 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. We believe that our impairment charges are trending lower because we closed a number of underperforming stores at the end of 2005, and continued to close (primarily through non renewal of leases) underperforming stores in 2006, 2007 and 2008. We only identified seven stores with impairment indicators as a result of our annual store impairment tests in 2008 and we recognized impairment charges on six of those stores. Therefore, we do not believe that varying the assumptions used to test for recoverability to estimate fair value of our long lived assets would have a material impact on the impairment charges we incurred in 2008. However, if our future operating results decline significantly, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material (see Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of this risk). In addition to our annual store impairment reviews, we evaluate our long lived assets at each reporting period to determine whether impairment indicators are present. In 2008, we recorded impairment to the assets of one store as a result of a casualty loss due to hurricane damage. The amount of this impairment is included in the $0.1 million 2008 impairment charge discussed above. Share Based Compensation We grant stock options and performance based nonvested restricted stock to our employees under shareholder approved incentive plans. Share based compensation expense was $15.5 million, $9.9 million, and $6.6 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The increase in share based compensation expense in each of the last three years is principally due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006, when we began recognizing expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the fair value of stock options. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2005, we accelerated the vesting of certain stock options, but not those granted after February 21, 2005, in order to reduce future expense on these options. The majority of our stock options granted in 2006 and subsequent years vest on a pro rata basis over a four year period. Assuming that we grant a similar number of stock options in 2009 to the number we granted in 2008, we would expect share based compensation expense to increase in 2009, to reflect the additional options outstanding that have unrecognized compensation expense. Because 2009 is the fourth year of expensing stock options and the majority of our stock options vest on a pro rata basis over four years, we do not expect the number of unvested options to continue to increase beyond 2009 unless the number of stock options granted increases in the future. Future share based compensation expense for stock options is dependent upon the number and terms of future stock option awards and many estimates, judgments and assumptions used in arriving at the fair value of stock options. Future expense related to stock options may vary materially from currently amortizing options. We estimate the fair value of our stock options using a binomial model. The binomial model takes into account estimates, assumptions, and judgments about our stock price volatility, our dividend yield rate, the risk free rate of return, the contractual term of the option, the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life, and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option. Expected volatility is based on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares. The dividend yield rate on our common shares is assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no immediate plans to do so. The risk free rate is based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of the grant. The expected life is determined from the application of the binomial model and includes assumptions such as the expected employee exercise behavior and our expected turnover rate, which is based on analysis of historical data. 34 Compensation expense for performance based nonvested restricted stock awards is recorded over the estimated vesting period based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria. An estimated target achievement date is determined at the time of the award based on historical and forecasted performance of similar measures. We monitor the achievement of the performance targets at each reporting period and make adjustments to the estimated vesting period when our internal models indicate that the estimated achievement date differs from the date being used to amortize expense. Any change in the estimated vesting date results in a prospective change to the related expense by charging the remaining unamortized expense over the remaining expected vesting period at the date the estimate was changed. On the grant date of the 2007 restricted stock awards, we estimated a three year period for vesting based on the assumed achievement of the higher financial performance objective. In the second quarter of 2007, we changed the estimated achievement date from three years to two years as a result of our performance being better than expected, resulting in $1.6 million and $1.1 million of incremental expense in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We achieved the higher financial performance objective for the 2007 awards based on the 2008 results, and accordingly, these awards will vest on the first trading date following the filing of this report. On the grant date of the 2008 restricted stock awards, we estimated a three year period for vesting based on the assumed achievement of the higher financial performance objective. In the second quarter of 2008, we changed the estimated achievement date for the higher financial performance objective from three years to two years due to better operating results than initially anticipated, resulting in $0.8 million of incremental expense in 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we changed the estimated achievement date for the higher financial performance objective from two years to three years due to our declining net sales results which were in part due to the general economic conditions in the United States. Income Taxes The determination of our income tax expense, refunds receivable, income taxes payable, deferred tax assets and liabilities and financial statement recognition, de recognition and or measurement of uncertain tax benefits (for positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns) requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex accounting and multi jurisdictional income tax laws. The effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income (loss) before income taxes, the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income (loss), changes in the income tax laws (which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year), subsequent recognition, de recognition and or measurement of an uncertain tax benefit in accordance with FIN No. 48, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise. We consider all available positive and negative evidence including recent financial results, projected future pretax accounting income from continuing operations and tax planning strategies (when necessary). This evaluation requires us to make assumptions that require significant judgment about the forecasts of future pretax accounting income. The assumptions that we use in this evaluation are consistent with the assumptions and estimates used to develop our consolidated operating financial plans. If we determine that a portion of our deferred tax assets, which principally represent expected future deductions or benefits, are not likely to be realized, we recognize a valuation allowance for our estimate of these benefits which we believe are not likely recoverable. Additionally, changes in tax laws, apportionment of income for state tax purposes, and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets. In accordance with FIN No. 48, we evaluate the uncertainty of income tax positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns. When a tax position meets the FIN No. 48 more likely than not threshold, we recognize economic benefits associated with the position on our consolidated financial statements. The more likely than not recognition threshold is a positive assertion that an enterprise believes it is entitled to economic benefits associated with a tax position. When a tax position doesnt meet the more likely than not threshold, or in the case of those positions that do meet the threshold but are measured at less than the full benefit taken on the 35 return, we recognize tax liabilities (or de recognize tax assets, as the case may be). A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have derecognized a tax benefit, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively or ultimately settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or as a result of the evaluation of new information that becomes available. Pension Actuarial valuations are used to calculate the estimated expenses and obligations for our pension plans. Inherent in the actuarial valuations are several assumptions including discount rate and expected return on plan assets. We review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return. Our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date. In making this estimate, we review rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits. This process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of Aa or better. The expected long term rate of return on assets is derived from detailed periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes, risks (standard deviations) and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long term, prospective rate of return. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for 2008 is 6.5%. A 0.5% decrease in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension cost by $0.1 million. The long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in 2008 is 8.5%. A 1.0% decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by $0.4 million. We recognized a charge of $9.3 million, net of tax, to other comprehensive income in 2008, principally as a result of the decline in value of investments held by the pension trust. As of January 31, 2009, the accumulated other comprehensive income amount, which was principally unrealized actuarial loss, was $15.3 million, net of tax. During 2008, we reclassified $0.8 million, pretax, from other comprehensive income to expense in our consolidated statement of operations. During 2009, and in future periods, we expect to reclassify approximately $2.6 million from other comprehensive income to expense, assuming we achieve our estimated rate of return on pension plan investments in future periods. Additionally, in the event that we have future settlement events, as occurred in 2007 and 2006, we would expect that the expense related to future settlements would be greater than the $1.3 million and $1.5 million charges in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Insurance and Insurance related Reserves We are self insured for certain losses relating to property, general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical and dental benefit claims, a portion of which is funded by employees. We purchase stop loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposure in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity. Management makes estimates, judgments, and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially based calculations, including but not limited to, estimated health care cost trends, estimated lag time to report and pay claims, average cost per claim, network utilization rates, network discount rates, and other factors. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at January 31, 2009 would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $8 million. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a 4.0% discount rate, while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted. A 1.0% change in the discount rate on these liabilities would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $1 million. 36 Lease Accounting In order to recognize rent expense on our leases, we evaluate many factors to identify the lease term such as the contractual term of the lease, our assumed possession date of the property, renewal option periods, and the estimated value of leasehold improvement investments that we are required to make. Based on this evaluation, our lease term is typically the minimum contractually obligated period over which we have control of the property. This term is used because although many of our leases have renewal options, we typically do not incur an economic or contractual penalty in the event of non renewal. Therefore, we typically use the initial minimum lease term for purposes of calculating straight line rent, amortizing deferred rent, and recognizing depreciation expense on our leasehold improvements. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Fair Value Measurements Effective February 3, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), for financial assets and liabilities on a prospective basis. The FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements in a non recurring basis, which we will adopt effective the beginning of 2009. SFAS No. 157 addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The standard provides a single definition of fair value that is to be applied consistently for most accounting applications and also generally describes and prioritizes according to reliability the methods and inputs used in valuations. SFAS No. 157 prescribes additional disclosures regarding the extent of fair value measurements included in a companys financial statements and the methods and inputs used to arrive at these values. The adoption of this statement for financial assets and liabilities did not have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The adoption of this statement for non financial assets and liabilities in 2009 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Pension Effective in 2008, SFAS No. 158 requires us to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of our year end consolidated balance sheet. Previously, our pension plans had a measurement date of December 31. Switching to the new measurement date required one time adjustments of $0.1 million to retained earnings and less than $0.1 million to accumulated comprehensive income in 2008 per the transition guidance in SFAS No. 158. Fair Value Option Effective February 3, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits us to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value. We did not elect to measure any additional financial assets or liabilities at fair value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Future Adoptions In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which changes the accounting for business combinations and their effects on the financial statements. SFAS No. 141(R) will be effective at the beginning of 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 requires entities to report non controlling interests in subsidiaries as equity in their consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 will be effective at the beginning of 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 37 In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosure about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, which requires additional disclosures for employers pension plan assets. As pension plan assets were not included within the scope of SFAS No. 157, this FSP requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under SFAS No. 157, the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. FSP 132(R) 1 will be effective at the end of 2009. Because this FSP provides only disclosure requirements, it will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Commitments For a discussion of commitments, refer to note 3, note 5, note 10, and note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on investments that we make from time to time and on borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement. We had no fixed rate long term debt at January 31, 2009. An increase of 1.0% in our variable interest rate on our outstanding debt would not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 38
