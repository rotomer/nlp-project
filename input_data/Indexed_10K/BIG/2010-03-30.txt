Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) of this Form 10 K. 1 Real EstateThe following table compares the number of our stores in operation at the beginning and end of each of the last five fiscal years: 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Stores open at the beginning of the year 1,339 1,353 1,375 1,401 1,502 Stores opened during the year 52 21 7 11 73 Stores closed during the year (30 ) (35 ) (29 ) (37 ) (174 ) Stores open at the end of the year 1,361 1,339 1,353 1,375 1,401 As part of our real estate strategy initiated in the latter half of 2005, we closed a number of underperforming locations. During 2006 through 2008, we focused on improving profitability through managing our existing store base as the commercial real estate market demanded higher rent charges than our store operating model enabled us to pay. During 2009, the commercial real estate market softened and we were able to favorably negotiate renewals for certain store leases which previously may have resulted in store closures. Also during 2009, we successfully negotiated a number of new store leases as the availability of space improved and rental rates eased. For additional information about our real estate strategy, see the accompanying MD&A. The following table details our stores by state at January 30, 2010: Alabama 26 Maine 7 Ohio 101 Arizona 35 Maryland 13 Oklahoma 16 Arkansas 11 Massachusetts 15 Oregon 12 California 174 Michigan 40 Pennsylvania 67 Colorado 20 Minnesota 4 Rhode Island 1 Connecticut 8 Mississippi 15 South Carolina 30 Delaware 3 Missouri 24 Tennessee 46 Florida 107 Montana 1 Texas 114 Georgia 57 Nebraska 4 Utah 11 Idaho 5 Nevada 11 Vermont 4 Illinois 33 New Hampshire 6 Virginia 36 Indiana 43 New Jersey 13 Washington 20 Iowa 3 New Mexico 13 West Virginia 18 Kansas 9 New York 47 Wisconsin 10 Kentucky 40 North Carolina 63 Wyoming 2 Louisiana 22 North Dakota 1 Total stores 1,361 Number of states 47 Of our 1,361 stores, 36% operate in four states: California, Texas, Ohio, and Florida, and net sales from stores in these states represented 38% of our 2009 net sales. AssociatesAt January 30, 2010, we had approximately 35,600 active associates comprised of 13,100 full time and 22,500 part time associates. Temporary associates hired during the fall and winter holiday selling season increased the number of associates to a peak of 39,200 in 2009. Approximately 63% of the associates employed throughout the year are employed on a part time basis. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good, and we are not a party to any labor agreements. CompetitionWe operate in the highly competitive retail industry and face strong sales competition from other general merchandise, discount, food, arts and crafts, and dollar store retailers. Additionally, we compete with a number of companies for retail site locations, to attract and retain quality employees, and to acquire our broad assortment of closeout merchandise from vendors. 2 PurchasingAn integral part of our business is the sourcing and purchasing of quality brand name merchandise directly from manufacturers and other vendors typically at prices substantially below those paid by traditional retailers. We believe that we have built strong relationships with many brand name vendors and we have capitalized on our purchasing power in the closeout marketplace, including our ability to pay timely, and to source merchandise that provides exceptional value to our customers. We have the ability to source and purchase significant quantities of a vendors closeout merchandise in specific product categories and to control distribution in accordance with vendor instructions. We believe this provides a high level of service and convenience to our vendors. Our sourcing channels also include bankruptcies, liquidations, and insurance claims. We supplement our traditional brand name closeout purchases with various direct import and domestically sourced merchandise, which represents merchandise that our customers consistently expect us to have in our stores or merchandise that we believe offers our customers a significant value. We expect that the unpredictability of the retail and manufacturing environments coupled with our dominant purchasing power position will continue to support our ability to source quality closeout merchandise at competitive prices. We have a buying team with extensive closeout purchasing experience, which we believe has enabled us to develop successful long term relationships with many of the largest and most recognized vendors in the United States. We believe that, as a result of these relationships and our experience and reputation in the closeout industry, many vendors offer buying opportunities to us prior to attempting to dispose of their merchandise through other channels. Our merchandise is purchased from domestic and foreign vendors that provide us with multiple sources for each product category. In 2009, our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 14% of total purchases (at cost) while the largest vendor accounted for approximately 3% of total purchases (at cost). During 2009, we purchased approximately 25% of our merchandise directly from overseas vendors, including approximately 19% from vendors located in China. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. As a result, a significant portion of our merchandise supply is subject to certain risks as described further in Item 1A in this Form 10 K. Warehouse and DistributionThe majority of the merchandise sold by us is received and processed for retail sale and distributed to the retail locations from our five regional distribution centers located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Alabama, Oklahoma and California. Some of our vendors deliver merchandise directly to our stores. We previously operated two furniture distribution centers located in Redlands, California and Columbus, Ohio. During 2009, we integrated the distribution of furniture from our Redlands, California furniture distribution center into our regional distribution center in California. During 2008, we integrated the distribution of furniture from our Columbus, Ohio furniture distribution center into our regional distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Alabama and Oklahoma. We believe these changes allow us to more efficiently flow furniture to our stores primarily by reducing the transportation cost from the furniture distribution centers to the stores because the regional distribution centers are generally located closer to the stores they service. We manage the inventory levels of merchandise in our distribution centers so that we can distribute merchandise quickly and efficiently to our stores in order to maximize sales and our inventory turnover rate. We selected the locations of our distribution centers in an attempt to minimize transportation costs and the distance from distribution centers to our stores. In addition to the merchandise distribution centers, we operate a warehouse in Ohio that distributes store fixtures and supplies. During 2009, we integrated the distribution of store fixtures and supplies out of our Redlands, California furniture distribution center into our Ohio warehouse. We believe this change reduces our fixed overhead and operating costs, and allows us to more effectively manage store fixtures and supplies inventory. During the past three years, we implemented several warehouse, distribution, and outbound transportation initiatives, including but not limited to a vendor compliance program in 2006 that imposes strict documentation and packing requirements on shipments of merchandise that we receive in our distribution centers, an outbound transportation initiative in 2007 that led to a higher use of one way carriers and thus a reduction in round trip miles, the integration in 2008 and 2009 of our former furniture distribution centers into all of our regional distribution centers, and other transportation initiatives aimed at lowering our inbound and outbound transportation costs. 3 For additional information regarding our warehouses and distribution facilities and related initiatives, see the discussion under the caption Warehouse and Distribution in Item 2. Properties, of this Form 10 K and the discussion under the caption Operating Strategy Cost Structure in the accompanying MD&A in this Form 10 K. Advertising and PromotionOur brand image is an important part of our marketing program. Our principal trademarks, including the Big Lots family of trademarks, have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We use a variety of marketing approaches to promote our brand and retail position through television, internet, in store point of purchase, and print media. The centerpiece of our marketing efforts is our television campaign which combines elements of strategic branding and promotion. These same elements are then used in all other consumer touch points. Our highly targeted media placement strategy uses national cable as the foundation of our television buys which is then supplemented with local broadcast in key markets. Our marketing program utilizes printed advertising circulars, which we design, and are distributed in all markets that are served by our stores. In 2009 and 2008, we distributed multi page circulars covering 27 weeks which we will repeat in 2010. We distribute circulars through a combination of newspaper insertions and mailings. We create regional versions of these circulars to take advantage of market differences caused by product availability, climate, and customer preferences. In addition, we use in store promotional materials, including in store signage, emphasize special bargains and significant values offered to customers. We continue to use our website (www.biglots.com) as a key touch point for special catalogs and our online advertising, attracting over 0.7 million unique visitors each week. In 2006, we overhauled and re launched our website. Our on line customer list, which we refer to as the Buzz Club, has grown from just over one million members at the end of 2006 to approximately five million members at the end of 2009. The Buzz Club database is an important marketing tool which allows us to communicate in a cost effective manner with our customer, including e mail delivery of our circulars. In addition to Buzz Club, in August of 2009, we started our Buzz Club Rewards program (Rewards), which has grown to 1.2 million members at the end of fiscal 2009. Members of the Rewards program use a membership card when making purchases and earn discounts on future purchases when they meet certain thresholds. Rewards members may also receive other targeted promotions via e mail. Total advertising expense as a percentage of total net sales was 2.0% in 2009 and 2.2% in 2008 and 2007. SeasonalityWe have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, our quarterly net sales and operating profits can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the timing of television and circular advertising, and the timing of certain holidays. We historically receive a higher proportion of merchandise, carry higher inventory levels, and incur higher outbound shipping and payroll expenses as a percentage of sales in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The fourth fiscal quarter typically includes a leveraging effect on operating results because net sales are higher and certain of our costs are fixed such as rent and depreciation. The seasonality of our net sales and related merchandise inventory requirements influences our availability of and demand for cash or access to credit. We historically have maintained and drawn upon our credit facility to fund our working capital requirements, which typically peak slightly before or after the end of our third fiscal quarter. We historically have higher net sales, operating profits, and cash flow provided by operations in the fourth fiscal quarter which allows us to substantially repay our seasonal borrowings. In 2009, our total indebtedness (outstanding borrowings and letters of credit) peaked at approximately $120.8 million in early February 2009 under our $500.0 million unsecured credit facility entered into in October 2004 (2004 Credit Agreement). As of January 30, 2010, we had no borrowings under the $500.0 million unsecured credit facility entered into in April 2009 (2009 Credit Agreement), which replaced the 2004 Credit Agreement. We expect that borrowings will vary throughout 2010 depending on various factors, including our seasonal need to acquire merchandise inventory prior to peak selling seasons, the timing and amount of sales to our customers and the potential impact of shares repurchased under our authorized share repurchase program. For additional information on our current share repurchase program, the 2009 Credit Agreement, and a discussion of our sources and uses of funds, see Item 5, Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and the Capital Resources and Liquidity section under Item 7, MD&A, in this Form 10 K. 4 Available InformationWe make available, free of charge, through the Investor Relations section of our website (www.biglots.com) under the SEC Filings caption, our Annual Reports on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q, Current Reports on Form 8 K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

RISK FACTORSThe statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements constitute cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our disclosure and analysis in this Form 10 K and in our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders contain some forward looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on managements plans and assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forward looking statements. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, objective, goal, project, intend, plan, believe, will, should, may, target, forecast, guidance, outlook, and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, forward looking statements include statements relating to future actions, future performance, or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. We cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated, or projected results set forth in the forward looking statements. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and Current Reports on Form 8 K filed with the SEC. 5 Also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relevant to our businesses. There can be no assurances that we have correctly and completely identified, assessed, and accounted for all factors that do or may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Consequently, all of the forward looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the results or developments we anticipate will be realized or that they will have the expected effects on our business or operations. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Our ability to achieve the results contemplated by forward looking statements is subject to a number of factors, any one, or a combination, of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. These factors may include, but are not limited to: The current economic conditions (including falling home prices, high levels of unemployment, foreclosures on mortgages, bankruptcies, and reduced access to credit) give rise to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity including, but not limited to the following: Fluctuating commodity prices, including but not limited to diesel fuel and other fuels used to generate power by utilities, may affect our gross profit and operating profit margins. The impact of these conditions on our vendors businesses cannot be predicted. Our vendors may be negatively impacted due to insufficient availability of credit to fund their operations or insufficient demand for their products, which may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Our expectations regarding the demand for our merchandise may be inaccurate, which could cause us to under buy or over buy certain categories or departments of merchandise, which could result in customer dissatisfaction or excessive markdowns required to sell through the merchandise. The reaction of our competitors to the marketplace, including the level of liquidations occurring at bankrupt retailers, may drive our competitors, some of whom are better capitalized than us, to offer significant discounts or promotions on their merchandise, which could negatively affect our sales and profit margins. A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital or increase the borrowing rates we pay. A significant decline in the market value of our qualified defined benefit pension plans (Pension Plan) investment portfolios may affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Additionally, many of the effects and consequences of the financial market uncertainties and broad economic downturn are currently unknown and beyond our control; any one or all of them could potentially have a material adverse impact on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. If we are unable to continue to successfully execute our operating strategies, our operating performance could be significantly impacted. There is a risk that we will be unable to continue to meet or exceed our operating performance targets and goals in the future if our strategies and initiatives are unsuccessful. In 2010, we announced operating performance targets and goals as part of an updated strategic plan, that we intend to use as our roadmap for the next three years (see the accompanying MD&A for additional information concerning our operating strategy). The new plan includes a continued focus on merchandising, real estate, and cost structure. 6 If we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive discount retail industry, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The discount retail business is highly competitive. As discussed in Item 1 of this Form 10 K, we compete for customers, employees, products, real estate, and other aspects of our business with a number of other companies. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than us. It is possible that increased competition or improved performance by our competitors may reduce our market share, gross margin, and operating margin, and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in other ways. Declines in general economic condition, consumer spending levels, and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise thereby materially adversely affecting our revenues and gross margin. Our results of operations can be directly impacted by the health of the United States economy. Our business and financial performance may be adversely impacted by current and future economic conditions, including factors that may restrict or otherwise negatively impact consumer financing, disposable income levels, unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence consumer spending. The economies of four states (Ohio, Texas, California, and Florida) are particularly important as approximately 36% of our current stores operate in these states and 38% of our 2009 net sales occurred in these states. Changes by vendors related to the management of their inventories may reduce the quantity and quality of brand name closeout merchandise available to us or may increase our cost to acquire brand name closeout merchandise, either of which may materially adversely affect our revenues and gross margin. The products we sell are sourced from a variety of vendors with approximately half of our merchandise assortment being pre planned and made for us and approximately half of our merchandise sourced on a closeout basis. The portion of our assortment that is pre planned and made for us consists of imported merchandise (primarily furniture, seasonal, and portions of our home categories along with certain other classifications like toys) or merchandise that is re orderable upon demand. For the closeout component of our business, we do not control the supply, design, function, availability, or cost of many of the products that we offer for sale. We depend upon the sufficient availability of closeout merchandise that we can acquire and offer at prices that represent a value to our customers, in order to meet or exceed our operating performance targets for gross margin. In addition, we rely on our vendors to provide us with quality merchandise. To the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory, the amount of closeout merchandise available to us could be materially reduced. Shortages or disruptions in the availability of closeout merchandise of a quality acceptable to our customers and us, would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and gross margin and may result in customer dissatisfaction. We rely on vendors located in foreign countries for significant amounts of merchandise. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. Our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in driving higher gross margin. During 2009, we purchased approximately 25% of our products directly from overseas vendors including 19% from vendors located in China. Our ability to find qualified vendors and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside of the United States. Global sourcing and foreign trade involve numerous factors and uncertainties beyond our control including increased import duties, increased shipping costs, more restrictive quotas, loss of "most favored nation" trading status, currency and exchange rate fluctuations, work stoppages, transportation delays, economic uncertainties such as inflation, foreign government regulations, political unrest, natural disasters, war, terrorism, trade restrictions (including retaliation by the United States against foreign practices), political instability, the financial stability of vendors, merchandise quality issues, and tariffs. These and other issues affecting our international vendors could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. 7 Disruption to our distribution network, the capacity of our distribution centers, and the timely receipt of merchandise inventory could adversely affect our operating performance. We rely on the ability to replenish depleted merchandise inventory through deliveries to our distribution centers and from the distribution centers to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, rail and truck carriers. A decrease in the capacity of carriers and or labor strikes or shortages in the transportation industry could negatively affect our distribution network, the timely receipt of merchandise and transportation costs. In addition, long term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure from wars, political unrest, terrorism, natural disasters and other significant events that lead to delays or interruptions of service could adversely affect our business. Also, a fire, earthquake, or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receiving, processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business. As we continue to grow, we may face increased or unexpected demands on distribution center operations, as well as unexpected demands on our distribution network. In addition, new store locations receiving shipments that are increasingly further away from our distribution centers will increase transportation costs and may create transportation scheduling strains. Our inability to properly manage our inventory levels and offer merchandise that our customers want may materially adversely impact our business and financial performance. We must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, we also must guard against accumulating excess inventory as we seek to maintain appropriate in stock levels. As stated above, we obtain approximately a quarter of our merchandise from vendors outside of the United States. These foreign vendors often require lengthy advance notice of our requirements in order to be able to supply products in the quantities that we request. This usually requires us to order merchandise and enter into purchase order contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise well in advance of the time these products are offered for sale. As a result, we may experience difficulty in responding to a changing retail environment, which makes us vulnerable to changes in price and in consumer preferences. In addition, even though the lead time to obtain domestically sourced merchandise is less, we attempt to maximize our gross margin and operating efficiency by delivering proper quantities of merchandise to our stores in a timely manner. If we do not accurately anticipate future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to replenish inventory levels, our inventory levels may not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. Changes in federal or state legislation and regulations, including the effects of legislation and regulations on product safety, could increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our operating performance. We are exposed to the risk that new federal or state legislation, including new product safety laws and regulations, may negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our operating performance. For example, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 addresses a number of consumer product safety issues, including the permissible levels of lead and phthalates in certain products. Additional changes in product safety legislation or regulations may lead to product recalls and the disposal or write off of merchandise, as well as fines or penalties and reputational damage. If our merchandise, including food and consumable products, do not meet applicable governmental safety standards or our customers expectations regarding quality or safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements, or execute product recalls in a timely manner, could result in fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, negative customer perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause us to lose market share to our competitors. If this occurs, it may be difficult for us to regain lost sales. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including various collective or class action lawsuits that are brought against us for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we may not be able to accurately determine the impact on us of any future adverse outcome of such proceedings. The ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of certain current legal proceedings, see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 8 We may be subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations, and accounting standards that may adversely affect our business and financial performance. Changes in governmental regulations and accounting standards, including new interpretations and applications of accounting standards, may have adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The bankruptcy of our formerly owned KB Toys business may adversely affect our business and financial performance. In December 2000, we sold the KB Toys business to KB Acquisition Corporation. On January 14, 2004, KB Acquisition Corporation and certain affiliated entities (collectively KB I) filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code. On August 30, 2005, in connection with the acquisition by an affiliate of Prentice Capital Management of majority ownership of KB I, KB I emerged from their January 14, 2004 bankruptcy (the KB Toys business that emerged from bankruptcy is hereinafter referred to as KB II). On December 11, 2008, KB II filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code. Based on information we have received subsequent to the December 11, 2008 bankruptcy filing, we believe we may have indemnification and guarantee obligations (KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations) with respect to 31 KB Toys store leases and a lease for a former KB corporate office. Because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability, our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. For additional information regarding the KB Toys bankruptcies, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. A significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our long lived assets and deferred tax assets. We are required by accounting rules to periodically assess our property and equipment and deferred tax assets for impairment and recognize an impairment loss or valuation charge, if necessary. In performing these assessments, we use our historical financial performance to determine whether we have potential impairments or valuation concerns and as evidence to support our assumptions about future financial performance. If our financial performance significantly declines, it could negatively affect the results of our assessments of the recoverability of our property and equipment and our deferred tax assets. There is a risk that if our future operating results significantly decline, it could impair our ability to recover the value of our property and equipment and deferred tax assets. Impairment or valuation charges taken against property and equipment and deferred tax assets could be material and could have a material adverse impact on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity (see the discussion under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the accompanying MD&A in this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our accounting policies for long lived assets and income taxes). Our inability, if any, to comply with the terms of the 2009 Credit Agreement may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We have the ability to borrow funds under the 2009 Credit Agreement and we utilize this ability at various times depending on operating or other cash flow requirements. The 2009 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens, and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of these covenants may permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access loans and letters of credit and may require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans. If we are not in compliance with these covenants, it may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 9 If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient. We depend on a variety of information systems for the efficient functioning of our business. We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. Costs and potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of our existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our business. If we are unable to successfully execute our SAP for Retail system implementation, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient. In January 2008, we announced our plans to implement SAP for Retail solutions over the next few years. New financial systems, including general ledger, accounts payable and fixed assets, were developed and tested during 2008 and 2009. The new financial systems have been placed in service in 2010. A new core merchandising system is planned for development and testing in 2010 and 2011, with plans to place the new core merchandising system in service when testing has been completed. The implementation of these systems is expected to have a pervasive impact on our information systems and across a significant portion of our general office operations, including merchandising, technology, and finance. If we are unable to successfully implement SAP for Retail, it may have an adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. If we are unable to retain existing and secure suitable new store locations under favorable lease terms, our financial performance may be negatively affected. We lease almost all of our stores and a significant number of these leases expire or are up for renewal each year. Our strategy to improve our financial performance includes sales growth while managing the occupancy cost of each of our stores. A component of our sales growth strategy is to open new store locations. If we are not able to negotiate favorable new store leases and lease renewals, our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity may be negatively affected. If we are unable to secure customer, employee, and company data, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to penalties or lawsuits. The protection of our customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business. In addition, our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines, and or lawsuits. If we lose key personnel, it may have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. We believe that we benefit substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives. The loss of services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse impact on our business. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train, and retain our senior executives and other qualified personnel. The price of our common shares as traded on the New York Stock Exchange may be volatile. Our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, general economic and stock market conditions, risks relating to our business and industry as discussed above, strategic actions by us or our competitors, variations in our quarterly operating performance, our future sales or purchases of our common shares, and investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common shares relative to other investment alternatives. 10 We also may be subject to a number of other factors which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially or adversely affect our business. These factors include, but are not limited to: Events or circumstances could occur which could create bad publicity for us or for types of merchandise offered in our stores which may negatively impact our business results including sales; Infringement of our intellectual property, including the Big Lots trademarks, could dilute our value; Our ability to attract and retain suitable employees; Our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing, and promotional programs; and Other risks described from time to time in our filings with the SEC. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIESRetail OperationsAll of our stores are located in the United States, predominantly in strip shopping centers, and have an average store size of approximately 29,800 square feet, of which an average of 21,400 square feet is selling square feet. The average cost to open a new store in a leased facility during 2009 was approximately $1.0 million, including cost of inventory. Except for 54 owned sites, all of our stores are leased. In 2008, we acquired, for $8.6 million, two store properties we were previously leasing. The 54 owned stores are located in the following states: State Stores Owned Arizona 3 California 39 Colorado 3 Florida 2 Louisiana 1 New Mexico 2 Ohio 1 Texas 3 Total 54 Store leases generally obligate us for fixed monthly rental payments plus the payment, in most cases, of our applicable portion of real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs (CAM), and property insurance. Some leases require the payment of a percentage of sales in addition to minimum rent. Such payments generally are required only when sales exceed a specified level. Our typical store lease is for an initial minimum term of five to 10 years with multiple five year renewal options. Sixty three store leases have sales termination clauses which can result in our exiting a location at our option if certain sales volume results are not achieved. 11 The following table summarizes the number of store lease expirations in each of the next five fiscal years and the total thereafter. In addition, as stated above, many of our store leases have renewal options. The table also includes the number of leases that are scheduled to expire each year that do not have a renewal option. The information includes stores with more than one lease and leases for stores not yet open. It excludes 16 month to month leases and 54 owned locations.

We own and operate five regional distribution centers strategically placed across the United States. Our regional distribution centers are owned and located in Ohio, California, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. In addition to these merchandise distribution centers, we operate two leased warehouses in Ohio. The regional distribution centers utilize warehouse management technology, which enables high accuracy and efficient processing of merchandise from vendors to our retail stores. The combined output of our merchandise distribution facilities was approximately 2.5 million cartons per week in 2009. Certain vendors deliver merchandise directly to our stores. We attempt to move merchandise from our vendors to the sales floor in the most efficient manner. The number of owned and leased warehouse and distribution facilities and the corresponding square footage of the facilities by state at January 30, 2010, were as follows: Square Footage State Owned Leased Total Owned Leased Total (Square footage in thousands) Ohio 1 2 3 3,559 731 4,290 California 1 1 1,423 1,423 Alabama 1 1 1,411 1,411 Oklahoma 1 1 1,297 1,297 Pennsylvania 1 1 1,295 1,295 Total 5 2 7 8,985 731 9,716 Corporate OfficeWe own the facility in Columbus, Ohio that serves as our general office for corporate associates.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESOur common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol BIG. The following table reflects the high and low sales prices per common share for our common shares as reported on the NYSE composite tape for the fiscal periods indicated: 2009 2008 High Low High Low First Quarter $ 28.36 $ 12.62 $ 28.65 $ 15.00 Second Quarter 28.50 19.49 34.88 26.03 Third Quarter 28.18 22.47 35.33 18.99 Fourth Quarter $ 31.39 $ 23.04 $ 24.88 $ 12.93 14 Our Board of Directors historically has authorized reinvesting available cash in capital expenditures for various maintenance and growth opportunities and in share repurchase programs. We historically have not paid dividends and our Board of Directors is not currently considering any change in this policy. In the event that we change our policy, any future cash dividend payments would be determined by our Board of Directors taking into account business conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial requirements and condition, opportunities for reinvesting cash, and other factors. On December 4, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our common shares, which commenced immediately and will continue until exhausted. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2009. On March 2, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million increase to our $150.0 million share repurchase program bringing the total authorization to $400.0 million (collectively the 2010 Repurchase Program). On March 10, 2010, we executed a $150.0 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR). See note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion regarding the ASR. We expect the remaining $250.0 million purchases under the 2010 Repurchase Program to be made from time to time in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. In 2007, we announced our $600.0 million March 2007 and $150.0 million November 2007 Repurchase Programs which we completed in the fourth fiscal quarter 2007 and first fiscal quarter 2008, respectively. During 2008, as part of these announced repurchased programs, we purchased 2.2 million common shares having an aggregate cost of $37.5 million with an average price paid per share of $17.28. During 2007, as part of these announced repurchase programs, we purchased 30.0 million common shares having an aggregate cost of $712.5 million with an average price paid per share of $23.76. The repurchased common shares were placed into treasury and are used for general corporate purposes including the issuance of shares related to employee benefit plans.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverviewThe discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. Please refer to Item 1A of this Form 10 K for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and or liquidity. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years with 52 weeks and some with 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 each were comprised of 52 weeks. Operating Results Summary The following are the results from 2009 that we believe are key indicators of our operating performance when compared to our operating performance in 2008. Net sales increased 1.8%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least two years at the beginning of 2009 increased 0.7%. We operated an average of 1,354 stores throughout 2009 compared to 1,356 average stores throughout 2008. Sales per selling square foot were $162 in 2009 and $160 in 2008. Gross margin as a percent of sales increased 60 basis points to 40.6% of sales in 2009 from 40.0% of sales in 2008. Gross margin dollars were higher by 3.3%. Average inventory levels were slightly lower throughout 2009 compared to 2008 and, combined with the 1.8% increase in net sales, resulted in a higher inventory turnover rate of 3.7 times in 2009 compared to 3.6 times in 2008. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased 40 basis points to 32.4% of sales from 32.8% of sales in 2008. Depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased 10 basis points to 1.6% of sales in 2009 from 1.7% of sales in 2008. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to $2.44 per share in 2009 compared to $1.89 per share in 2008. Cash provided by operating activities was $392.0 million in 2009 compared to $211.1 million in 2008. Our total inventory per average store was down 2.3% at the end of 2009 compared to 2008. Our accounts payable leverage increased at the end of 2009 as a result of a shift in our negotiated vendor payment terms towards a longer payment period which is more consistent with our retail competitors. Additionally, we paid income taxes of $106.0 million in 2009 compared to $92.4 million in 2008. In December of 2009 our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our common shares. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2009. 18 The following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales: 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation expense 59.4 60.0 60.5 shown separately below) Gross margin 40.6 40.0 39.5 Selling and administrative expenses 32.4 32.8 32.5 Depreciation expense 1.6 1.7 1.9 Gain on sale of real estate (0.3 ) 0.0 0.0 Operating profit 6.9 5.5 5.1 Interest expense (0.0 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Interest and investment income 0.0 0.0 0.1 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 6.8 5.4 5.1 Income tax expense 2.6 2.0 1.9 Income from continuing operations 4.3 3.3 3.2 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (0.0 ) (0.1 ) 0.2 Net income 4.2 % 3.3 % 3.4 % See the discussion below under the captions 2009 Compared To 2008 and 2008 Compared To 2007 for additional details regarding the specific components of our operating results. Selling and administrative expenses in 2009 were increased by $4.0 million (10 basis points), pretax, for a legal settlement agreement (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on this matter). Gain on sale of real estate in 2009 was $13.0 million (30 basis points), pretax, for a company owned and operated store in California sold at a gain. Selling and administrative expenses in 2007 were reduced by $5.2 million (10 basis points), pretax, for proceeds we received from the KB Toys bankruptcy trust (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) and $4.9 million (10 basis points), pretax, for insurance proceeds we received as recovery for 2005 hurricane insurance claims. SeasonalityAs discussed in Item 1. under the Seasonality caption, our financial results fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on various factors such as timing of new or closed stores, timing and extent of advertisements and promotions, and timing of holidays. We expect that the Christmas holiday selling season will continue to result in a significant portion of our sales and operating profits. If our sales performance is significantly better or worse during this time frame, we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results. 19 The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit for 2009, 2008, and 2007 by fiscal quarter: First Second Third Fourth Fiscal Year 2009 Net sales percentage of full year 24.1 % 23.0 % 21.9 % 31.0 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 18.5 14.7 14.6 52.2 Fiscal Year 2008 Net sales percentage of full year 24.8 % 23.8 % 22.0 % 29.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 22.8 17.1 7.9 52.2 Fiscal Year 2007 Net sales percentage of full year 24.2 % 23.3 % 22.1 % 30.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 18.0 14.1 9.6 58.3 Operating StrategyOver the past four fiscal years (fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2009), we have successfully repositioned our business by concentrating our efforts on the implementation of a strategy we refer to as the Whats Important Now Strategy (WIN Strategy). The WIN Strategy focuses on three key elements of the business: merchandising, real estate, and the cost structure. The WIN Strategy has been an operating profit growth strategy designed to expand the operating profit rate of our existing store base. Only recently, in 2009, as the commercial real estate market softened and rents declined, did we pursue net new store growth. Due to the implementation of WIN, our operating profit rate has expanded from 0.6% in 2005 to 6.9% in 2009 with operating profit dollars growing from $26.9 million to $325.0 million during that same time period. The growth in operating profit has translated to significant growth in earnings per share from continuing operations, which has increased from $0.14 per diluted share in 2005 to $2.44 per diluted share in 2009. Along the way, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of cash of which approximately $330 million was capital reinvested in our business and $900 million was returned to shareholders (aggregate share repurchases in 2006, 2007 and 2008 under publicly announced share repurchase programs). In 2010, we anticipate the key elements of the WIN Strategy will remain consistent and we are forecasting continued operating profit growth. However, we believe we are entering the next phase of the WIN Strategy a growth phase. The commercial real estate market has softened, thus providing more real estate available for us at prices that are more appropriate for our financial model and return on capital requirements. Given the strength of our financial performance we are in a better position to open new stores and take advantage of the current real estate market conditions. In 2010, we expect: An operating profit rate of 7.0% to 7.2% based on an estimated comparable store sales increase of 3% to 4%, flat gross margin rate, and expense leverage compared to last year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $2.65 to $2.75. Opening 80 new stores and closing 40 stores, for net growth of 40 stores or 3%. Cash provided by operating activities of approximately $315 million less capital expenditures of approximately $115 million resulting in $200 million of cash available for investment or redeployment, and The remaining $250.0 million of purchases under the 2010 Repurchase Program may be made from time to time in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. On March 10, 2010, we executed a $150.0 million accelerated share repurchase transaction. The following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our WIN Strategy with respect to merchandising, real estate, and cost structure. The 2009 Compared To 2008 section below provides additional discussion and analysis of the impact of these strategies on our financial performance and the assumptions and expectations upon which we are basing our guidance for our future results. 20 MerchandisingFrom a merchandising perspective, our competitive positioning as the largest broadline closeout retailer affords us a strategic advantage when sourcing merchandise for our stores. We source our merchandise in three key ways: Closeouts, or excess inventory, comprise approximately half of the merchandise available for sale to our customers. Manufacturers and vendors have excess merchandise for a number of different reasons including retailers canceling orders, retailers going out of business, marketing or packaging changes, a new product launch that has failed, or for other various reasons. In these situations, we are able to source product at a discounted cost and offer significant value savings to our customers. We currently have thousands of vendor relationships for excess inventory that have been developed over many years. These relationships along with the size and financial strength of our company are a key barrier to entry and minimize the opportunities for other competitors to enter our retail segment. For certain merchandise categories, there is not always an abundant supply of excess inventory. In certain merchandise categories under these situations, we will work with vendors to develop product and import merchandise from overseas. Imports total approximately 25% to 30% of our merchandise sold in any given year. Categories with the highest concentration of imports include Seasonal, Furniture, and to a lesser extent Home and the Toys department. The balance of our merchandise assortment is replenishable type product or the captive label businesses we operate. The merchandise has a consistency of flow and availability so that it can be offered in our stores day in and day out. It has many of the same characteristics as our closeout business but is replenishable upon demand. Our prices on this merchandise are still positioned below our competition although to a lesser extent than the closeout component of our business. We offer six major merchandising categories in our store: Consumables, Seasonal, Home, Hardlines, Furniture, and Other. These categories range in size with Consumables as the single largest at 30.8% of sales in 2009 and Other as the smallest at 12.0% of sales in 2009. In recent years, our merchandising strategies to increase sales have been predominantly focused on growing the size of the basket, or average transaction value. There have been two primary methods to accomplishing this goal: drive more units per transaction, and grow the average item retail by offering our customers better quality merchandise, better values, and more prominent brand name products. This approach is consistent with our customer research which suggests that our core customer recognizes quality and brands and is willing to pay a higher retail price, so long as the value or cost savings is significant compared to what other retailers are offering. This strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores and achieved positive comparable store sales. While executing our WIN Strategy, we have made measurable progress towards our goals of growing sales per selling square foot (which increased from $146 per square foot in 2005 to $162 per square foot in 2009) and increasing gross margin dollars (which increased from $1,732 million in 2005 to $1,919 million in 2009). From a merchandising perspective in 2010, our goal is to provide extreme value, improved quality, and continue to increase the presence of recognizable brand name merchandise in our stores. We expect our major merchandise categories will remain the same as prior years but the percentage of business by category may fluctuate from time to time based on customer demand and the availability of compelling deals that we are able to source and offer in our stores. Strategically, we anticipate opportunity does exist to continue to grow the basket, or average transaction value, through the same successful initiatives that benefitted results over the last few years. Additionally, during 2010 and in future years, we believe there are specific initiatives in marketing and store operations designed to begin to grow the number of transactions in our stores. 21 Our marketing efforts involve a mix of printed circulars, in store marketing, television, and online advertising. Much of our marketing is based on information that we have learned about our customers, principally through customer surveys. Based on this information, we believe over 70% of our core customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without a specific item or brand in mind to purchase. Value dominates top of mind awareness as our customers look to us for savings. Nearly one half of the customers surveyed said their shopping trips to our stores last over 30 minutes, which we interpret as them coming to shop our stores for the treasure hunt. We have improved, and expect to continue to develop, our in store signage and merchandising displays and arrangements. We continue to market to our Buzz Club members, by offering a free online membership and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores. Additionally, in 2009, we launched our Rewards program which is the first true loyalty card program in the Companys history. After enrolling in this program, the customer receives a Rewards card which is to be presented and scanned at the register at time of purchase. After ten qualifying purchases each of $20 or more, the Rewards member will receive a coupon for 20% off a future purchase in our stores. Additionally, members will receive, via email, our ad circulars and other targeted promotional materials. Due to the investments made in our store register systems during 2007 and 2008, each time a Rewards card is scanned we have the technology to record and monitor purchasing behavior. From a marketing perspective in 2010, there are three key initiatives designed to help to build transactions: First, the Rewards program and building the membership base is a key driver to future transaction growth. As of March 1, 2010, we have over 1.4 million Rewards members. To date, stores with the highest amount of Rewards member signups or penetration are seeing incremental transaction lifts in the low single digits. During 2010, we will be implementing technology that will enable us to offer our members targeted messages or promotions based on their specific buying patterns. Second, using our ad circulars and promotional pricing to create more buzzbuilders (excitement) could help increase transactions. The excitement created by buzzbuilders is predominantly achieved through price but uniqueness of item can be a factor as well. Lastly, we have expanded the mix of tender accepted in our stores and effective February 2010, we began accepting the American Express card. American Express cardholders typically have higher income demographics than other cardholders and we believe the marketing efforts and support from the vendor could increase our market share in that demographic. From a store operations perspective, we began the company wide rollout of our Ready for Business program in 2009. The program has certain performance criteria and standards aimed at improving the consistency of visual presentation, merchandise recovery efforts, and overall store cleanliness. Ready for Business also focuses on improvements in our employee training programs and hiring practices. This higher level of expectation and accountability within our store operations team increased the turnover rate of our district managers, store managers, and assistant store managers in 2009 and required us to recruit new talent to the organization. In 2010, we believe that continued focus on Ready for Business standards and the investment made in talent in 2009 could help to improve sales through both the size of the average basket and the number of transactions. Additionally, with a higher level of confidence in the discipline on store standards and a higher caliber management team in place, we have identified certain investments in both store layout and store improvement capital which we will be executing throughout 2010. This effort will address approximately 120 stores with potential upside sales opportunities. Real EstateFrom the beginning of fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008, we slowed our rate of new store openings based on our belief that many of the real estate locations available to us in the marketplace were too expensive and as such the return on investment would not be satisfactory to our shareholders. During 2006 through 2008, we opened a total of only 39 new stores (11 in 2006, 7 in 2007, and 21 in 2008). During the same timeframe, we closed 101 existing stores (37 in 2006, 29 in 2007, and 35 in 2008) for various reasons including lack of profitability, proposed new lease terms where rents were escalating and landlords were unwilling to renegotiate terms, or relocating the store to a potentially more productive location. 22 As a result of improvements in our store productivity and overall profitability over the last four years and the softening of the real estate market, we were able to grow our store base in 2009 for the first time in the last five years. We opened 52 new stores and closed 30 stores in 2009. The majority of our new store openings (41) were what we refer to as traditional stores, which are secondary or tertiary real estate normally located in retail strip centers. Additionally, in 2009 we tested two new store initiatives: A locations (8) and a smaller store concept (3). Generally speaking, new store openings performed very well in 2009 with A locations exceeding our expectations, traditional stores overall meeting our expectations and our small store test producing mixed results. We believe we have opportunities with respect to the lease options included in our existing store leases. As stated in Item 2. Properties, of this Form 10 K, we have 230 store leases that expire in 2010. We expect to close approximately 40 of these stores, some of which have not performed to our expectations, some of which have no more lease renewal options and we expect the landlord to choose a different tenant, and some of which we anticipate exiting by our choice in favor of relocating the store to a new location in a nearby area. For our remaining approximately 190 store locations with 2010 lease expirations, we expect to exercise our renewal option or negotiate more favorable lease renewal terms sufficient enough to enable us to achieve an acceptable return on our investment. Our real estate strategy has included the following additional investments in our existing fleet of stores in order to improve operating efficiency: In 2007 and 2008, we invested approximately $38 million to implement our new point of sale register system in all of our existing stores with the expected benefits to include more timely and accurate sales and inventory information, improved customer service through faster speed at checkout, lower repair and maintenance costs, and improved labor efficiency through the use of hand held technology. In 2007 and 2008, we invested approximately $7 million in store retrofits and new merchandise fixtures at approximately 110 of our stores to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications, specifically Furniture. In 2009, we tested a new store layout in approximately 20 locations, predominantly in Columbus, Ohio. The layout test was designed to improve the ease of shopping our stores. It features Consumables more prominently in our store and improves the visual sight lines within the store. The customer reaction indicated that the store seemed better organized, cleaner, and has improved lighting, wider aisles, and generally presents merchandise more effectively. Based on our evaluation of the test results, we will expand this program to an additional 105 stores in 2010. Also in 2009, we made certain investments, both capital and expense, in a Food Refresh program. The program emphasizes cleanliness and merchandise presentation in our food departments and it included new or refinished fixtures in approximately one half of our stores while all stores received new signage and shelf labeling. Based on feedback from our customers, we believe improved cleanliness, better fixtures, and dedicated associate staffing to maintain a better merchandise presentation instills customer confidence in the quality and freshness of our food merchandise. In 2010, we plan to increase the level of new store openings to 80 new stores and expect to close approximately 40 stores resulting in net store growth of 40 locations, or 3% of the total store base. In terms of the breakout of what types of stores we expect to open, the availability of space for our traditional locations remains good, rents are reasonable, and we estimate we will open approximately 50 traditional stores in 2010. In regards to A locations, we see a meaningful opportunity for growth in 2010 and estimate that we will open approximately 30 new A locations this year. This is a major step forward for our company and has been made possible by the softening in the commercial real estate market and the strength of our financial performance over the last several years. Additionally, a higher quality and more branded merchandise assortment along with improvements in store standards and customer service have given us the confidence that we can be successful in these locations with a new customer base that has a somewhat higher level of expectations in terms of the in store shopping experience. During 2009, we learned a great deal through our small store test about the operational aspects and the merchandising changes or edits that are critical in this size of store. We will continue to make modifications to our 3 test stores and monitor their progress. Along the way in 2010, we may also add a couple of stores to the test. 23 Cost Structure Our goal each year is to continue to generate expense leverage (lower expenses as a percent of net sales). We believe that several operational changes we have made, which we continue to refine, have significantly contributed to the achievement of our leverage goals. Some of the operational changes made include: Reduced inventory levels at our stores and regional distribution centers. Purchased and distributed merchandise to our stores in optimal quantities and pack sizes to minimize handling in our distribution centers and stores. Timed receipt of merchandise in stores closer to the expected display dates in order to avoid excessive handling merchandise. Increased the percentage of merchandise that arrives in our stores pre ticketed and pre packaged for efficient display and sale. Refined our staffing and payroll scheduling models in our stores, and Implemented several initiatives which lowered our distribution and outbound transportation expenses. As a result of these operational changes and certain other initiatives in the business, our overall expenses as a percent of sales have declined by 480 basis points (2009 expense rate of 33.7% versus 2005 expense rate of 38.5%). For 2010, we are forecasting an expense rate of 33.4% to 33.6%. Expense dollars are expected to decline in the areas of advertising, utilities, and insurance based on certain company specific initiatives developed by management. Store expenses along with distribution and transportation costs are expected to leverage as dollar growth in these areas is forecasted to be at a slower rate than our anticipated sales growth. Partially offsetting this leverage, we believe costs will increase and deleverage areas such as occupancy, depreciation, and equity related compensation expense, given the significant increase in our share price over the last 12 months. Discontinued OperationsWe continue to incur exit related costs for some of the 130 stores we closed in 2005 that we have classified as discontinued operations, specifically on the stores where lease obligations remain. We also report certain activity related to our prior ownership of the KB Toys business in discontinued operations. See note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of all of our discontinued operations. Share Repurchase ProgramIn December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our common shares. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2009. On March 2, 2010, based upon the strength of our operating performance and cash flow generation during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 and our estimated cash flow for fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million increase to our $150.0 million program bringing the total authorization of the 2010 Repurchase Program to $400.0 million. On March 10, 2010, we utilized $150.0 million of the authorization to execute an accelerated share repurchase transaction which reduced our common shares outstanding by 3.6 million. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based upon the volume weighted average price of our stock over a predetermined period and will not be known until that period ends and a final settlement occurs. The final settlement could increase or decrease the 3.6 million shares initially reduced from our outstanding common shares. The remaining $250.0 million will be utilized to repurchase shares in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. Common shares acquired through the 2010 Repurchase Program will be available to meet obligations under equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes. The 2010 Repurchase Program will continue until exhausted and will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash generated during fiscal 2010 or, if needed, by drawing on our $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. 24 2009 COMPARED TO 2008Net SalesAs previously discussed, we manage our business on the basis of one segment: broadline closeout retailing. We report net sales information for six merchandise categories. Net sales by merchandise category, as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 were as follows: 2009 2008 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,456,370 30.8 % $ 1,410,383 30.4 % $ 45,987 3.3 % Home 717,744 15.2 713,103 15.4 4,641 0.7 Furniture 716,785 15.2 698,276 15.0 18,509 2.7 Hardlines 677,790 14.3 646,563 13.9 31,227 4.8 Seasonal 591,321 12.5 585,025 12.6 6,296 1.1 Other 566,762 12.0 591,933 12.7 (25,171 ) (4.3 ) Net sales $ 4,726,772 100.0 % $ 4,645,283 100.0 % $ 81,489 1.8 % Net sales increased $81.5 million, or 1.8%, to $4,726.8 million in 2009 compared to $4,645.3 million in 2008. The increase in net sales was principally due to our comparable store sales increase of 0.7%, or approximately $32 million, and non comparable store sales, which increased by approximately $37 million. Our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of the current fiscal year. This calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria. The average number of stores in operation throughout 2009 and 2008 was approximately 1,354 stores and 1,356 stores, respectively. Following a comparable store sales decrease of 1.5% through the first half of 2009, sales trends improved resulting in a comparable store sales increase of 2.8% in the second half of 2009 thereby producing an annual comparable store sales increase of 0.7%. Comparable store sales increased in the low to mid single digits from September through January due to improvements in our merchandise offering, and improved discretionary spending trends as we met the first anniversary of the significant economic turmoil that began to impact us in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2008. Specifically, comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. Based on these trends and sales results of February 2010, we estimate 2010 comparable store sales will increase in the range of 3% to 4%. From a merchandise perspective, sales in most major merchandise categories increased in 2009 compared to 2008. Consumables continued its consistent sales growth throughout the year. Consumers continued to seek out value when shopping for the everyday household use items that we offer in our Consumables business. We believe our strategy of offering name brands at competitive prices led to this consistently positive net sales performance in the Consumables category. The Home category net sales consistently underperformed through the second fiscal quarter. However, accelerating sales trends in the second half of 2009 due to certain merchandise assortment changes and the improvement experienced in consumer discretionary spending trends led to a total sales increase for fiscal 2009. The Furniture category also underperformed through the third fiscal quarter principally due to lower sales in our mattress department. However, new key items in upholstery and case goods along with a sales rebound in our mattress department led to a fourth fiscal quarter comparable store sales increase in the high single digits leading to our overall sales increase of 2.7% for 2009. The Hardlines category continued its increase in net sales driven by sales of electronics, particularly DVDs, cameras and televisions. The Seasonal category net sales produced positive results in the second half of the year due to a comparable sales increase of our Christmas merchandise in the fourth fiscal quarter. The Other category sales decline is primarily due to three large closeout deals (drugstore merchandise, furniture, and apparel) that occurred in 2008; fewer closeout deals were sold in the Other category in 2009. Partly offsetting the closeout deals decline was an increase in toy department sales. 25 Gross MarginGross margin dollars increased $61.9 million, or 3.3%, to $1,919.3 million in 2009 compared to $1,857.4 million in 2008. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 40.6% in 2009 compared to 40.0% in 2008. The increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher gross margin rate and the increase in sales. The increase in gross margin rate increased gross margin dollars by approximately $29 million. Also contributing to the increased gross margin dollars was higher net sales of $81.5 million, which increased gross margin dollars by approximately $33 million. The gross margin rate increase was principally due to higher initial mark up on merchandise sold, lower inbound freight costs and a lower shrink accrual rate. We achieved lower inbound freight costs in 2009 because of lower diesel fuel costs, lower ocean freight rates, renegotiated carrier rates, and careful review of the mode of transportation to find the most efficient method to ship goods to our distribution centers. The gross margin rate also benefitted from favorable adjustments to the shrink accrual as physical inventories were completed at our stores. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.7 turns in 2009 compared to 3.6 turns in 2008. Based on historical results and current economic conditions, we expect our 2010 gross margin rate to be approximately 40.6%, or flat compared to 2009, as strength in initial mark up, lower shrink costs and a slightly lower markdown rate are expected to be offset by rising freight costs, both import and domestic. Based on the current general economic trends, our vendors may be negatively impacted by insufficient availability of credit to fund their operations or insufficient demand for their products, which may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Additionally, the general economic conditions have caused a higher level of uncertainty of our forecasted sales results, and thus, demand for our merchandise could differ materially from our expectation causing us to under or over buy certain merchandise, which may result in customer dissatisfaction or excessive markdowns required to liquidate the merchandise. Selling and Administrative ExpensesSelling and administrative expenses increased $8.5 million, or 0.6%, to $1,532.4 million in 2009 compared to $1,523.9 million in 2008. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally caused by an increase in store occupancy expenses of $15.5 million, higher employee benefit expenses of $7.7 million, higher share based compensation expense of $4.8 million, litigation related expenses of $4.6 million, and bonuses of $4.4 million. These items were partially offset by a $23.4 million decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs and a $6.1 million decrease in advertising expenses. The increase in store occupancy expenses is primarily due to higher rents and real estate taxes related to the leases of the 73 new stores opened in 2009 and 2008. The increase in employee benefits is principally due to higher paid health insurance claims and pension expense. The increase in share based compensation is primarily due to our acceleration of vesting of restricted stock grants based on our profit performance in 2009. In 2009, we accrued $4.0 million for a certain legal settlement agreement (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The $4.4 million increase of bonuses was directly related to our performance. The decline in distribution and outbound transportation costs is a result of lower inventory levels, the integration of our Ohio and California furniture distribution operations into our regional distribution centers in July 2008 and 2009, respectively, the renegotiation of dedicated carrier contracts with more favorable rates starting in August 2009, more efficient operations due to increased volume of cartons, and the impact of decreased diesel fuel costs. Advertising expenses decreased due to renegotiated printing contracts with more favorable terms, reduced local advertising, and reduced newspaper distributions. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32.4% in 2009 compared to 32.8% in 2008. The decrease of 0.4% is primarily due to the effect of the increase in sales of 1.8% as selling and administrative expense dollars increased 0.6% as discussed above. Our future selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales rate is dependent upon many factors including our level of net sales, our ability to implement additional efficiencies, principally in our store and distribution center operations, and fluctuating commodity prices, such as diesel fuel, which directly affects our outbound transportation cost. In 2010, we expect expense leverage based on company specific initiatives to lower costs and the leveraging impact of our estimated comparable store sales increase of 3% to 4%. We expect expense dollars to decrease in the areas of advertising, utilities, and health insurance based on certain company specific initiatives and program changes. We estimate dollars will increase in store payroll, and distribution and transportation; however, the increase is forecasted to be at a lower rate than our estimated total sales growth of 5% to 6%. Additionally, we are forecasting slight deleverage in the areas of occupancy, depreciation, and equity related compensation expenses. 26 Depreciation ExpenseDepreciation expense decreased $3.7 million, or 4.7%, to $74.9 million in 2009 compared to $78.6 million for 2008. The decrease in depreciation expense was principally related to our stores and was due to assets becoming fully depreciated since the prior year. Many of these fully depreciated assets were placed in service in 2003 or 2004 and had five year estimated service lives. Compared to more recent years, capital expenditures were significantly higher in 2003 and 2004, principally due to store remodels and a higher number of store openings in 2003 and 2004. For 2010, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $115 million. Using this assumption and the run rate of depreciation on our existing property and equipment, we expect 2010 depreciation expense to be $80 million to $85 million, which would represent an increase from the $74.9 million of depreciation expense in 2009. Interest ExpenseInterest expense decreased $3.5 million to $1.8 million in 2009 compared to $5.3 million in 2008. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to lower average borrowings (including capital leases) of $8.6 million in 2009 compared to average borrowings of $151.8 million in 2008. The higher average borrowings in 2008 were driven principally by the acquisition of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase programs which were completed in 2008. In 2009, cash flow provided by operations was sufficient to repay the borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our average effective interest rate of 1.8% in 2009 was lower than our average effective interest rate of 3.5% in 2008. The decrease in the average effective interest rate, which resulted from generally lower rates in the overall short term interest rate markets, decreased our interest expense by approximately $0.1 million in 2009. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income increased $0.1 million in 2009 to $0.2 million compared to $0.1 million in 2008. The increase in interest and investment income was caused by the increase in funds available to invest in 2009 compared to 2008, partly offset by a decrease in investment yield. Our average invested amount in 2009 was $68.9 million compared to $3.6 million in 2008. In 2009, we invested primarily in deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments, including money market funds and variable rate demand notes. We held $245.0 million of investments at the end of 2009. Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 37.7% for 2009 compared to 38.0% for 2008. The net decrease in 2009 was primarily driven by the release of the valuation allowance on unrealized capital losses in contrast to an increase in the valuation allowance in 2008. We anticipate our 2010 effective income tax rate to be within a range of 38.0% to 39.0%. Discontinued OperationsLoss from discontinued operations was $1.0 million, net of tax, in 2009 compared to $3.3 million, net of tax, in 2008. The 2009 loss from discontinued operations was primarily due to the KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, we obtained assignment of a lease for the former KB II corporate office and recorded a charge of $0.7 million, net of tax, in loss from discontinued operations. The remaining $0.3 million loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2009 pertained to other KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations. KB II declared bankruptcy again in December 2008. As a result of this bankruptcy filing, KB II rejected 31 store leases for which we believe we have an indemnification obligation. The 2008 loss from discontinued operations of $3.3 million, net of tax, was comprised of $3.0 million, net of tax, for the KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations and $0.3 million, net of tax, for exit related costs on the remaining 2005 closed stores which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. 27 2008 COMPARED TO 2007Net SalesNet sales by merchandise category, as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 were as follows: 2008 2007 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,410,383 30.4 % $ 1,339,433 28.8 % $ 70,950 5.3 % Home 713,103 15.4 783,047 16.8 (69,944 ) (8.9 ) Furniture 698,276 15.0 687,292 14.8 10,984 1.6 Hardlines 646,563 13.9 629,119 13.5 17,444 2.8 Seasonal 585,025 12.6 597,933 12.8 (12,908 ) (2.2 ) Other 591,933 12.7 619,478 13.3 (27,545 ) (4.4 ) Net sales $ 4,645,283 100.0 % $ 4,656,302 100.0 % $ (11,019 ) (0.2 ) % Net sales decreased $11.0 million, or 0.2%, to $4,645.3 million in 2008 compared to $4,656.3 million in 2007. There were fewer open stores in 2008 which caused a decrease of $34.0 million partially offset by our comparable store sales increase of 0.5%, which increased sales by $23.0 million. Our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of 2008. This calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria. Following a comparable store sales increase of 3.1% in the first half of 2008, sales trends softened resulting in a comparable store sales decrease of 1.9% in the second half of 2008. We believe that our comparable store sales results in the third and fourth fiscal quarters were in part due to the worsening general economic trends. From a merchandise perspective, the Consumables, Hardlines, and Furniture categories net sales increased while net sales of Home, Other, and Seasonal declined. Consumables continued its consistent sales growth throughout the year. As the year progressed, consumers chose to seek out value when shopping for the everyday household use items that we offer in our Consumables business. We believe our strategy of offering name brands at competitive prices has led to this consistently positive net sales performance in the Consumables category. The Hardlines category increase in net sales was driven by the availability in the second half of 2008 of multiple closeout deals containing higher ticket electronics, highlighted by significant values on items such as popular video games and personal computer laptops from national brand manufacturers. The Furniture category increase was driven by sales of mattresses, which were attributable to the customer response throughout the year especially when promotional pricing was coupled with holiday events such as the Labor Day mattress promotion. The Home category net sales consistently underperformed throughout the year continuing a trend which began in the first half of 2007. We believe our customers elected to defer purchases of this type of merchandise. The Other category sales decline is primarily due to lower sales of toys principally in the latter half of the year, when toys represent a relatively larger portion of our total net sales. The lower toys sales results were partially offset within the Other category by higher sales driven by closeout deals of licensed kids underwear during the first half of the year. The Seasonal category net sales produced positive results in the first half of the year for lawn & garden and summer merchandise; however, the second half of the years net sales underperformed due to lower comparable store sales for Christmas, Halloween, and harvest. Because the Christmas selling season represents a higher portion of the total years sales in this category, the decline in Christmas merchandise sales drove the category sales lower for the year. Gross MarginGross margin dollars increased $17.1 million, or 0.9%, to $1,857.4 million in 2008 compared to $1,840.3 million in 2007. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 40.0% in 2008 compared to 39.5% in 2007. The increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to the higher gross margin rate, which increased gross margin dollars by approximately $21 million. Partially offsetting the higher gross margin rate was lower net sales of $11.0 million, which reduced gross margin dollars by approximately $4 million. The gross margin rate increase of 50 basis points was primarily due to higher initial markup on merchandise and favorable shrink results partially offset by higher markdowns and the mix impact of our higher net sales in merchandise categories, such as Consumables, that have lower gross margin rates. The improvement in initial markup was due in part to a drugstore liquidation deal, a furniture closeout from a large national brand, and an overall favorable deal environment for closeout merchandise. In addition, initial markup was higher in 2008 due to our Home Event, which we offered in our stores principally during the first half of the year. The Home Event merchandise was included in the Furniture category and Home category. Shrink was lower principally due to favorable physical inventory results. Higher markdowns were attributable in part to planned markdowns associated with a drugstore liquidation deal, a furniture closeout from a large national brand, and our Home Event merchandise. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.6 turns in 2008 compared to 3.5 turns in 2007. 28 Selling and Administrative ExpensesSelling and administrative expenses increased $8.5 million, or 0.6%, to $1,523.9 million in 2008 compared to $1,515.4 million in 2007. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally caused by an increase in medical plan expenses of $9.7 million, higher share based compensation expense of $5.5 million, the 2007 partial recovery of the HCC Note investment of $5.2 million (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the HCC Note), the 2007 reduction in selling and administrative expenses due to the receipt of insurance proceeds for 2005 hurricane claims of $4.9 million, and higher store utilities of $3.4 million. These items were partially offset by a $17.1 million decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs and a $15.8 million decrease in store payroll costs. The increase in medical plan expenses is principally due to higher paid claims. The increase in share based compensation is principally due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) under the modified prospective method of accounting in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 and our acceleration of vesting of stock options in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005. Higher store utilities costs were driven by colder weather this winter and higher average commodity rates throughout the majority of 2008. The decline in distribution and outbound transportation costs is a result of lower inventory levels, fewer cartons processed through our distribution centers (as discussed above), more one way trips to the stores resulting in higher shipping cost per mile but fewer miles traveled and, beginning in July 2008, the integration of our Ohio furniture distribution operation into four of our regional distribution centers. Partially offsetting these favorable distribution and outbound transportation costs was the impact of higher diesel fuel prices. Store payroll is lower due to fewer stores and employees and fewer cartons of merchandise resulting from the $11.0 million decline in net sales and the merchandise strategy that involves offering merchandise with slightly higher average item retails. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32.8% in 2008 compared to 32.5% in 2007. Excluding the impact of the $5.2 million partial recovery of the HCC Note and the receipt of hurricane insurance proceeds of $4.9 million, both of which reduced 2007 selling and administrative expenses, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Depreciation ExpenseDepreciation expense decreased $9.9 million, or 11.2 %, to $78.6 million in 2008 compared to $88.5 million for 2007. The decrease was principally related to the five year service life store remodel program assets that were placed in service in 2002 and 2003 and a lower level of capital expenditures in 2006 and 2007. The lower capital expenditures in 2006 and 2007 are principally related to opening seven stores in 2007 and 11 stores in 2006 compared to opening 73, 103, and 86 stores in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In addition, in 2006 and 2007, we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system, which was installed in approximately 700 stores in 2007 and in all of our remaining stores in 2008. As a result of the installation of the new point of sale register system, we reduced the estimated remaining service life on our old register system, effective the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. The impact of this service life reduction was to recognize $4.1 million in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2008 as additional depreciation expense associated with the old cash registers. Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased $2.8 million to $5.3 million in 2008 compared to $2.5 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average borrowings of $151.8 million in 2008 compared to average borrowings of $37.9 million in 2007. The higher average borrowings caused interest expense to be higher by approximately $4 million. The higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase programs. Our average effective interest rate of 3.5% in 2008 was lower than our average effective interest rate of 6.6% in 2007. The decrease in the average effective interest rate, which resulted from generally lower rates in the overall short term interest rate markets, decreased our interest expense by approximately $1.0 million in 2008. 29 Interest and Investment IncomeInterest and investment income decreased $5.1 million in 2008 to $0.1 million compared to $5.2 million in 2007. The decline in interest and investment income was caused by the reduction in funds available to invest in 2008 compared to 2007. Our average invested amount in 2008 was $3.6 million compared to $130.4 million in 2007. The decline in funds available for investment was caused by the $750 million of share repurchases under our 2007 Share Repurchase Programs during the period March 2007 through February 2008. In 2007, we invested primarily in money market type investments that were considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds. We did not hold any investment balances at the end of 2008. Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 38.0% for 2008 compared to 36.8% for 2007. The net increase in 2008 was driven by a decrease in nontaxable municipal interest income, the increase in the valuation allowance on unrealized capital losses (versus a net decrease in the valuation allowance in 2007), and a change in the jurisdictional earnings mix, partially offset by the settlement of certain income tax matters. Discontinued OperationsLoss from discontinued operations was $3.3 million, net of tax, in 2008 compared to income from discontinued operations of $7.3 million, net of tax in 2007. The 2008 loss from discontinued operations of $3.3 million, net of tax, was comprised of $3.0 million, net of tax, for the KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligation (as defined in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and $0.3 million, net of tax, for exit related costs on the remaining 2005 closed stores which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. KB Toys declared bankruptcy again in December 2008. As a result of this bankruptcy filing, KB Toys rejected 31 store leases for which we believe we have an indemnification obligation. Based on the lease data for these 31 stores and using our prior experience with these matters, we estimated a KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligation of $3.0 million, net of tax. The income from discontinued operations in 2007 was principally comprised of 1) the release of our KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations of $6.6 million, net of tax, 2) the recognition of $1.1 million of proceeds, net of tax, from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations and the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center (formerly owned by KB Toys) mortgage guarantee, and 3) exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases have not been terminated. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYOn April 28, 2009, we entered into the 2009 Credit Agreement, a new $500 million three year unsecured credit facility that replaced the 2004 Credit Agreement. The 2009 Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on April 28, 2012. In connection with our entry into the 2009 Credit Agreement, we paid an aggregate amount of $5.6 million of bank fees and expenses, which are being amortized over the term of the agreement. Proceeds from borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain of our indebtedness. The 2009 Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sublimit and a $30 million swing loan sublimit. The interest rates, pricing and fees under the 2009 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating. The 2009 Credit Agreement allows us to select our interest rate for each borrowing from two different interest rate options. The interest rate options are generally derived from the prime rate or LIBOR. We may prepay revolving loans made under the 2009 Credit Agreement. The 2009 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the 2009 Credit Agreement that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2009 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2009 Credit Agreement. As of January 30, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenants of the 2009 Credit Agreement. 30 The primary sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations and, as necessary, borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement. Our net income and cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, and operating profit margins. Our net sales are typically highest during the Christmas selling season (during our fourth fiscal quarter). Generally, our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter. We have typically funded those requirements with borrowings under our credit facility. At January 30, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding under the 2009 Credit Agreement and, after taking into account the reduction in availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $50.1 million, the borrowings available under the 2009 Credit Agreement were $449.9 million. We anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than $75.0 million through the end of June 2010, all of which will be comprised of letters of credit, excluding any impact from the execution of the 2010 Repurchase Program. In 2009, our total indebtedness (outstanding borrowings and letters of credit) peaked at approximately $120.8 million in early February 2009 under our 2004 Credit Agreement. Working capital was $580.4 million at January 30, 2010. Whenever our liquidity position requires us to borrow funds under the 2009 Credit Agreement, we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis. The daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position, which is generally driven by the following components of our operations: 1) cash inflows such as cash or credit card receipts collected from stores for merchandise sales and other miscellaneous deposits; and 2) cash outflows such as check clearings for the acquisition of merchandise, payroll and other operating expenses, wire and other electronic transactions for merchandise purchases, income and other taxes, employee benefits, and other miscellaneous disbursements. We use the 2009 Credit Agreement, as necessary, to provide funds for ongoing and seasonal working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, and other expenditures. In addition, we use the 2009 Credit Agreement to provide letters of credit for various operating and regulatory requirements, a significant portion of which consists of letters of credit required as a result of our self funded insurance programs. Given the seasonality of our business, the amount of borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors, including our operating financial performance, the time of year, and our need to increase merchandise inventory levels prior to the peak selling season. Cash provided by operating activities was $392.0 million, $211.1 million and $307.9 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The 2009 increase in cash provided by operating activities of $180.9 was principally due to higher net income and improved accounts payable leverage (accounts payable divided by inventories). Accounts payable leverage improved due to the lower amount of inventories and our efforts to continue to work with our import and domestic vendors to further extend payment terms. The 2008 decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $96.8 million was primarily due to the decline in accounts payable leverage as accounts payable decreased more than inventory decreased. Accounts payable decreased because of a shift in our merchandise mix to purchases from vendors with shorter payment terms, many of whom offered us cash discounts. Our cash paid for income taxes was $106.0 million, $92.4 million, and $65.8 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The increases in income taxes paid were a direct result of higher operating profits and partly impacted by the timing of required tax payments relative to the fiscal years in which these profits were earned. Our total contributions to the Pension Plan were $10.8 million, $11.3 million, and $0.9 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively. These contributions were made to increase the funded level of the Pension Plan. Based on assumptions about our 2010 operating performance that we have discussed above in MD&A, we expect cash provided by operating activities to be approximately $315 million in 2010. However, based on the current general economic conditions, consumers may elect to defer or forego purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news. Reduced consumer spending may reduce our net sales, which could lower our profitability and limit our ability to convert merchandise inventories to cash. Cash used in investing activities was $77.9 million, $88.2 million, and $58.8 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The 2009 decrease in cash used in investing activities of $10.3 and the 2008 increase in cash used in investing activities of $29.4 million was principally due to fluctuations in capital expenditures year from year. The 2009 capital expenditures were driven by the investments in 52 new store openings and the continued development of our SAP for Retail system. The 2008 capital expenditures were driven by the investments in 21 new store openings, our SAP for Retail system, which included development costs and additional payments for hardware and licensing fees, the completion of the installation of new cash registers in all of our stores, and the acquisition of two store properties that were previously leased. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $115 million in 2010, comprised principally of maintenance capital of approximately $35 million to $40 million, real estate capital of approximately $35 million to $40 million driven by our plan to open 80 new stores, and other investments of approximately $40 million which include, among other things, capital to refresh 120 stores, investment in energy management systems for 700 stores, and our continued software development of the SAP for Retail system. 31 Cash used in financing activities was $65.1 million, $125.2 million, and $493.7 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In 2009, cash used in financing activities was principally due to the repayment of borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility of $60.7 million and the payment of bank fees of $5.6 million associated with our entry into the 2009 Credit Agreement, partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $4.9 million. In 2008, cash used in financing activities was principally due to net payments on our prior bank credit facility of $102.0 million and $37.5 million of payments for treasury shares acquired under our November 2007 Repurchase Program, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10.9 million. In December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $150 million of our common shares. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2009. On March 2, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million increase to our $150.0 million program bringing the total authorization of the 2010 Repurchase Program to $400.0 million. On March 10, 2010, we utilized $150.0 million of the authorization to execute an accelerated share repurchase transaction which reduced our common shares outstanding by 3.6 million. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based upon the volume weighted average price of our stock over a predetermined period and will not be known until that period ends and a final settlement occurs. The final settlement could increase or decrease the 3.6 million shares initially reduced from our outstanding common shares. The terms of the ASR restrict us from declaring a dividend prior to its completion, which is currently scheduled to be no later than January 26, 2011. The remaining $250 million will be utilized to repurchase shares in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. Common shares acquired through the 2010 Repurchase Program will be available to meet obligations under equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes. The 2010 Repurchase Program will continue until exhausted and will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash generated during fiscal 2010 or, if needed, by drawing on our $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Based on historical and expected financial results, we believe that we have or, if necessary, have the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing and seasonal working capital requirements, proposed capital expenditures, new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at January 30, 2010: Payments Due by Period (1) Less than More than Total 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years 5 years (In thousands) Obligations under bank credit facility (2) $ $ $ $ $ Operating lease obligations (3) (4) 917,454 263,782 386,664 206,795 60,213 Capital lease obligations (4) 3,707 2,352 1,220 135 Purchase obligations (4) (5) 839,587 676,012 113,544 49,354 677 Other long term liabilities (6) 46,652 16,317 7,347 2,371 20,617 Total contractual obligations (7) $ 1,807,400 $ 958,463 $ 508,775 $ 258,655 $ 81,507 (1) The disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report. Those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate; consequently, the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur. Variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from the actually incurred include, but are not limited to: the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration; fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation; the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report; fluctuations in third party fees, governmental charges, or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors; and the exercise of renewal options under, or the automatic renewal of, contracts that provide for the same. 32 (2) Obligations under bank credit facility consist of the borrowings outstanding under the 2009 Credit Agreement. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $50.1 million at January 30, 2010. Approximately $46.8 million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit; accordingly, they have been excluded from this table. The remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in Purchase Obligations. For a further discussion, see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (3) Operating lease obligations include, among other items, leases for retail stores, warehouse space, data center, offices, and certain computer and other business equipment. The future minimum commitments for retail store, data center, office, and warehouse space operating leases are $687.6 million. For a further discussion of leases, see note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. In connection with our store lease obligations, we estimated that future obligations for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance were $221.9 million at January 30, 2010. We have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Those assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: use of historical data to estimate our future obligations; calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold; and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data. The remaining lease obligation of $8.0 million relates primarily to operating leases for computer and other business equipment. (4) For purposes of the lease and purchase obligation disclosures, we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date, and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension. Where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term, we disclosed in the table our minimum commitment under such obligation, such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term, due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing leases. (5) Purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at $478.5 million, the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of January 31, 2010. In addition, we have a purchase commitment for future inventory purchases totaling $138.5 million at January 31, 2010. While we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment, we have included, for purposes of this tabular disclosure, we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods, as purchases that will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation. The remaining $222.6 million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation, information technology, print advertising, energy procurement, and other store security, supply, and maintenance commitments. (6) Other long term liabilities include $15.4 million for expected contributions to the Pension Plan and our nonqualified, unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan (Supplemental Pension Plan), $17.1 million for obligations related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, $13.4 million for unrecognized tax benefits, and $0.8 million for closed store lease termination costs. Pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans). We have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions. We have included unrecognized tax benefits of $2.6 million for payments expected in 2010 and $10.8 million of timing related income tax uncertainties anticipated to reverse in 2010. Unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $20.9 million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments. Our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms. (7) The obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities, guarantees, and indemnities related to the KB Toys business. For further discussion, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 33 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor a discussion of the KB Bankruptcy Lease Obligations, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Because the KB Toys business filed for bankruptcy again in December 2008 and liquidated all of its store operations, we accrued a contingent liability on our balance sheet at January 30, 2010, in the amount of $4.8 million for 31 KB Toys store leases for which we may have an indemnification or guarantee obligation and a former KB Toys corporate office lease for which we took an assignment in 2009. Because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability, our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, judgments, and assumptions, including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.Because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates, judgments, and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies, including the recently adopted accounting standards and recent accounting standards future adoptions, are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Merchandise InventoriesMerchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period. The average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear slow moving inventory, the estimated allowance for shrinkage, and the estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and prior or future gross margin. These estimates are based on historical experience and current information. When management determines the salability of merchandise inventories is diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, the age of merchandise, and seasonal trends. Timing of holidays within fiscal periods, weather, and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year. The inventory allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories, charged to cost of sales, and calculated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period. Such estimates are based on our historical and current year inventory results. Independent physical inventory counts are taken at each store once a year. During 2010, the majority of these counts occur between January and September. As physical inventories are completed, actual results are recorded and new go forward shrink accrual rates are established based on individual store historical results. Thus, the shrink accrual rate will be adjusted throughout the January through September inventory cycle based on actual results. At January 30, 2010, a 10% difference in our shrink reserve would have affected gross margin, operating profit and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $4 million. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, we have loss prevention programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage. 34 Long Lived AssetsOur long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment. We perform annual impairment reviews of our long lived assets at the store level. When we perform the annual impairment reviews, we first determine which stores had impairment indicators present. We use actual historical cash flows to determine which stores had negative cash flows in each of the past two years (on a rolling basis). For each store with two years of negative cash flows, we obtain future cash flow estimates based on operating performance estimates specific to each stores operations that are based on assumptions currently being used to develop our company level operating plans. If the net book value of a stores long lived assets is not recoverable by the expected future cash flows of the store, we estimate the fair value of the stores assets and recognize an impairment charge for the excess net book value of the stores long lived assets over their fair value. The fair value of store assets is estimated based on information available in the marketplace for similar assets. We recognized impairment charges of $0.4 million, $0.1 million, and $0.8 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We believe that our impairment charges are trending lower because we closed a number of underperforming stores at the end of 2005, and continued to close (primarily through non renewal of leases) underperforming stores in 2007, 2008, and 2009. We only identified four stores with impairment indicators as a result of our annual store impairment tests in 2009 and we recognized impairment charges on those stores. Therefore, we do not believe that varying the assumptions used to test for recoverability to estimate fair value of our long lived assets would have a material impact on the impairment charges we incurred in 2009. However, if our future operating results decline significantly, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material (for additional discussion of this risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors A significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our long lived assets and deferred tax assets.). In addition to our annual store impairment reviews, we evaluate our long lived assets at each reporting period to determine whether impairment indicators are present. In 2008, we recorded impairment to the assets of one store as a result of a casualty loss due to hurricane damage. The amount of this impairment is included in the $0.1 million 2008 impairment charge discussed above. Share Based CompensationWe grant stock options and performance based non vested restricted stock to our employees under shareholder approved incentive plans. Share based compensation expense was $20.3 million, $15.5 million, and $9.9 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The increase in share based compensation is primarily due to our acceleration of vesting of restricted stock grants based on our profit performance in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Future share based compensation expense for performance based non vested restricted stock is dependent upon the future number of awards, fair value of our common shares on the grant date, and the estimated vesting period. Future share based compensation expense for stock options is dependent upon the number and terms of future stock option awards and many estimates, judgments and assumptions used in arriving at the fair value of stock options. Future share based compensation expense related to performance based non vested restricted stock and stock options may vary materially from the currently amortizing awards. We estimate the fair value of our stock options using a binomial model. The binomial model takes into account estimates, assumptions, and judgments about our stock price volatility, our dividend yield rate, the risk free rate of return, the contractual term of the option, the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life, and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option. Expected volatility is based on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares. The dividend yield rate on our common shares is assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no immediate plans to do so. The risk free rate is based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of the grant. The expected life is determined from the application of the binomial model and includes assumptions such as the expected employee exercise behavior and our expected turnover rate, which is based on analysis of historical data. 35 Compensation expense for performance based non vested restricted stock awards is recorded over the estimated vesting period based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria. An estimated target achievement date is determined at the time of the award based on historical and forecasted performance of similar measures. We monitor the achievement of the performance targets at each reporting period and make adjustments to the estimated vesting period when our internal models indicate that the estimated achievement date differs from the date being used to amortize expense. Any change in the estimated vesting date results in a prospective change to the related expense by charging the remaining unamortized expense over the remaining expected vesting period at the date the estimate was changed. Income TaxesThe determination of our income tax expense, refunds receivable, income taxes payable, deferred tax assets and liabilities and financial statement recognition, de recognition and or measurement of uncertain tax benefits (for positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns) requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex accounting and multi jurisdictional income tax laws. The effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income (loss) before income taxes, the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income (loss), changes in the income tax laws (which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year), subsequent recognition, de recognition and or measurement of an uncertain tax benefit, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise. We consider all available positive and negative evidence including recent financial results, projected future pretax accounting income from continuing operations and tax planning strategies (when necessary). This evaluation requires us to make assumptions that require significant judgment about the forecasts of future pretax accounting income. The assumptions that we use in this evaluation are consistent with the assumptions and estimates used to develop our consolidated operating financial plans. If we determine that a portion of our deferred tax assets, which principally represent expected future deductions or benefits, are not likely to be realized, we recognize a valuation allowance for our estimate of these benefits which we believe are not likely recoverable. Additionally, changes in tax laws, apportionment of income for state tax purposes, and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets. We evaluate the uncertainty of income tax positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns. When a tax position meets the more likely than not threshold, we recognize economic benefits associated with the position on our consolidated financial statements. The more likely than not recognition threshold is a positive assertion that an enterprise believes it is entitled to economic benefits associated with a tax position. When a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold, or in the case of those positions that do meet the threshold but are measured at less than the full benefit taken on the return, we recognize tax liabilities (or de recognize tax assets, as the case may be). A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have derecognized a tax benefit, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively or ultimately settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or as a result of the evaluation of new information that becomes available. PensionActuarial valuations are used to calculate the estimated expenses and obligations for our Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan. Inherent in the actuarial valuations are several assumptions including discount rate and expected return on plan assets. We review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return. Our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date. In making this estimate, we review rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits. This process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of Aa or better. The expected long term rate of return on assets is derived from detailed periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes, risks (standard deviations) and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long term, prospective rate of return. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for 2009 was 7.3%. A 1.0% decrease in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension cost by $0.2 million. The long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in 2009 was 8.0%. A 1.0% decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by $0.6 million. 36 During 2009, we reclassified $1.7 million, net of tax, from other comprehensive income to expense in our consolidated statement of operations. We recognized a benefit of $0.4 million, net of tax, to other comprehensive income in 2009, principally as a result of the increase in value of investments held by the pension trust. As of January 30, 2010, the accumulated other comprehensive income amount, which was principally unrealized actuarial loss, was $13.1 million loss, net of tax. During 2010, and in future periods, we expect to reclassify approximately $2.0 million from other comprehensive income to expense, assuming we achieve our estimated rate of return on pension plan investments in future periods. Additionally, in the event that we have future settlement events, as occurred in 2009 and 2007, we would expect that the expense related to future settlements would be greater than the $0.2 million and $1.3 million charges in 2009 and 2007, respectively. Insurance and Insurance related ReservesWe are self insured for certain losses relating to property, general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical and dental benefit claims, a portion of which is funded by employees. We purchase stop loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposure in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity. Management makes estimates, judgments, and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially based calculations, including but not limited to, estimated health care cost trends, estimated lag time to report and pay claims, average cost per claim, network utilization rates, network discount rates, and other factors. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at January 30, 2010 would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $8 million. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a 4.0% discount rate, while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted. A 1.0% change in the discount rate on these liabilities would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $1.5 million. Lease AccountingIn order to recognize rent expense on our leases, we evaluate many factors to identify the lease term such as the contractual term of the lease, our assumed possession date of the property, renewal option periods, and the estimated value of leasehold improvement investments that we are required to make. Based on this evaluation, our lease term is typically the minimum contractually obligated period over which we have control of the property. This term is used because although many of our leases have renewal options, we typically do not incur an economic or contractual penalty in the event of non renewal. Therefore, we typically use the initial minimum lease term for purposes of calculating straight line rent, amortizing deferred rent, and recognizing depreciation expense on our leasehold improvements. COMMITMENTSFor a discussion of commitments, refer to note 3, note 5, note 10, and note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 37 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on investments and on borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement that we make from time to time. We had no borrowings at January 30, 2010 under the 2009 Credit Agreement. An increase of 1.0% in our variable interest rate on our investments and expected future borrowings would not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 38 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverviewThe discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. Please refer to Item 1A of this Form 10 K for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and or liquidity. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years with 52 weeks and some with 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 each were comprised of 52 weeks. Operating Results Summary The following are the results from 2009 that we believe are key indicators of our operating performance when compared to our operating performance in 2008. Net sales increased 1.8%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least two years at the beginning of 2009 increased 0.7%. We operated an average of 1,354 stores throughout 2009 compared to 1,356 average stores throughout 2008. Sales per selling square foot were $162 in 2009 and $160 in 2008. Gross margin as a percent of sales increased 60 basis points to 40.6% of sales in 2009 from 40.0% of sales in 2008. Gross margin dollars were higher by 3.3%. Average inventory levels were slightly lower throughout 2009 compared to 2008 and, combined with the 1.8% increase in net sales, resulted in a higher inventory turnover rate of 3.7 times in 2009 compared to 3.6 times in 2008. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased 40 basis points to 32.4% of sales from 32.8% of sales in 2008. Depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased 10 basis points to 1.6% of sales in 2009 from 1.7% of sales in 2008. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to $2.44 per share in 2009 compared to $1.89 per share in 2008. Cash provided by operating activities was $392.0 million in 2009 compared to $211.1 million in 2008. Our total inventory per average store was down 2.3% at the end of 2009 compared to 2008. Our accounts payable leverage increased at the end of 2009 as a result of a shift in our negotiated vendor payment terms towards a longer payment period which is more consistent with our retail competitors. Additionally, we paid income taxes of $106.0 million in 2009 compared to $92.4 million in 2008. In December of 2009 our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our common shares. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2009. 18 The following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales: 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation expense 59.4 60.0 60.5 shown separately below) Gross margin 40.6 40.0 39.5 Selling and administrative expenses 32.4 32.8 32.5 Depreciation expense 1.6 1.7 1.9 Gain on sale of real estate (0.3 ) 0.0 0.0 Operating profit 6.9 5.5 5.1 Interest expense (0.0 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Interest and investment income 0.0 0.0 0.1 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 6.8 5.4 5.1 Income tax expense 2.6 2.0 1.9 Income from continuing operations 4.3 3.3 3.2 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (0.0 ) (0.1 ) 0.2 Net income 4.2 % 3.3 % 3.4 % See the discussion below under the captions 2009 Compared To 2008 and 2008 Compared To 2007 for additional details regarding the specific components of our operating results. Selling and administrative expenses in 2009 were increased by $4.0 million (10 basis points), pretax, for a legal settlement agreement (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on this matter). Gain on sale of real estate in 2009 was $13.0 million (30 basis points), pretax, for a company owned and operated store in California sold at a gain. Selling and administrative expenses in 2007 were reduced by $5.2 million (10 basis points), pretax, for proceeds we received from the KB Toys bankruptcy trust (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) and $4.9 million (10 basis points), pretax, for insurance proceeds we received as recovery for 2005 hurricane insurance claims. SeasonalityAs discussed in Item 1. under the Seasonality caption, our financial results fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on various factors such as timing of new or closed stores, timing and extent of advertisements and promotions, and timing of holidays. We expect that the Christmas holiday selling season will continue to result in a significant portion of our sales and operating profits. If our sales performance is significantly better or worse during this time frame, we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results. 19 The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit for 2009, 2008, and 2007 by fiscal quarter: First Second Third Fourth Fiscal Year 2009 Net sales percentage of full year 24.1 % 23.0 % 21.9 % 31.0 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 18.5 14.7 14.6 52.2 Fiscal Year 2008 Net sales percentage of full year 24.8 % 23.8 % 22.0 % 29.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 22.8 17.1 7.9 52.2 Fiscal Year 2007 Net sales percentage of full year 24.2 % 23.3 % 22.1 % 30.4 % Operating profit as a percentage of full year 18.0 14.1 9.6 58.3 Operating StrategyOver the past four fiscal years (fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2009), we have successfully repositioned our business by concentrating our efforts on the implementation of a strategy we refer to as the Whats Important Now Strategy (WIN Strategy). The WIN Strategy focuses on three key elements of the business: merchandising, real estate, and the cost structure. The WIN Strategy has been an operating profit growth strategy designed to expand the operating profit rate of our existing store base. Only recently, in 2009, as the commercial real estate market softened and rents declined, did we pursue net new store growth. Due to the implementation of WIN, our operating profit rate has expanded from 0.6% in 2005 to 6.9% in 2009 with operating profit dollars growing from $26.9 million to $325.0 million during that same time period. The growth in operating profit has translated to significant growth in earnings per share from continuing operations, which has increased from $0.14 per diluted share in 2005 to $2.44 per diluted share in 2009. Along the way, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of cash of which approximately $330 million was capital reinvested in our business and $900 million was returned to shareholders (aggregate share repurchases in 2006, 2007 and 2008 under publicly announced share repurchase programs). In 2010, we anticipate the key elements of the WIN Strategy will remain consistent and we are forecasting continued operating profit growth. However, we believe we are entering the next phase of the WIN Strategy a growth phase. The commercial real estate market has softened, thus providing more real estate available for us at prices that are more appropriate for our financial model and return on capital requirements. Given the strength of our financial performance we are in a better position to open new stores and take advantage of the current real estate market conditions. In 2010, we expect: An operating profit rate of 7.0% to 7.2% based on an estimated comparable store sales increase of 3% to 4%, flat gross margin rate, and expense leverage compared to last year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $2.65 to $2.75. Opening 80 new stores and closing 40 stores, for net growth of 40 stores or 3%. Cash provided by operating activities of approximately $315 million less capital expenditures of approximately $115 million resulting in $200 million of cash available for investment or redeployment, and The remaining $250.0 million of purchases under the 2010 Repurchase Program may be made from time to time in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. On March 10, 2010, we executed a $150.0 million accelerated share repurchase transaction. The following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our WIN Strategy with respect to merchandising, real estate, and cost structure. The 2009 Compared To 2008 section below provides additional discussion and analysis of the impact of these strategies on our financial performance and the assumptions and expectations upon which we are basing our guidance for our future results. 20 MerchandisingFrom a merchandising perspective, our competitive positioning as the largest broadline closeout retailer affords us a strategic advantage when sourcing merchandise for our stores. We source our merchandise in three key ways: Closeouts, or excess inventory, comprise approximately half of the merchandise available for sale to our customers. Manufacturers and vendors have excess merchandise for a number of different reasons including retailers canceling orders, retailers going out of business, marketing or packaging changes, a new product launch that has failed, or for other various reasons. In these situations, we are able to source product at a discounted cost and offer significant value savings to our customers. We currently have thousands of vendor relationships for excess inventory that have been developed over many years. These relationships along with the size and financial strength of our company are a key barrier to entry and minimize the opportunities for other competitors to enter our retail segment. For certain merchandise categories, there is not always an abundant supply of excess inventory. In certain merchandise categories under these situations, we will work with vendors to develop product and import merchandise from overseas. Imports total approximately 25% to 30% of our merchandise sold in any given year. Categories with the highest concentration of imports include Seasonal, Furniture, and to a lesser extent Home and the Toys department. The balance of our merchandise assortment is replenishable type product or the captive label businesses we operate. The merchandise has a consistency of flow and availability so that it can be offered in our stores day in and day out. It has many of the same characteristics as our closeout business but is replenishable upon demand. Our prices on this merchandise are still positioned below our competition although to a lesser extent than the closeout component of our business. We offer six major merchandising categories in our store: Consumables, Seasonal, Home, Hardlines, Furniture, and Other. These categories range in size with Consumables as the single largest at 30.8% of sales in 2009 and Other as the smallest at 12.0% of sales in 2009. In recent years, our merchandising strategies to increase sales have been predominantly focused on growing the size of the basket, or average transaction value. There have been two primary methods to accomplishing this goal: drive more units per transaction, and grow the average item retail by offering our customers better quality merchandise, better values, and more prominent brand name products. This approach is consistent with our customer research which suggests that our core customer recognizes quality and brands and is willing to pay a higher retail price, so long as the value or cost savings is significant compared to what other retailers are offering. This strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores and achieved positive comparable store sales. While executing our WIN Strategy, we have made measurable progress towards our goals of growing sales per selling square foot (which increased from $146 per square foot in 2005 to $162 per square foot in 2009) and increasing gross margin dollars (which increased from $1,732 million in 2005 to $1,919 million in 2009). From a merchandising perspective in 2010, our goal is to provide extreme value, improved quality, and continue to increase the presence of recognizable brand name merchandise in our stores. We expect our major merchandise categories will remain the same as prior years but the percentage of business by category may fluctuate from time to time based on customer demand and the availability of compelling deals that we are able to source and offer in our stores. Strategically, we anticipate opportunity does exist to continue to grow the basket, or average transaction value, through the same successful initiatives that benefitted results over the last few years. Additionally, during 2010 and in future years, we believe there are specific initiatives in marketing and store operations designed to begin to grow the number of transactions in our stores. 21 Our marketing efforts involve a mix of printed circulars, in store marketing, television, and online advertising. Much of our marketing is based on information that we have learned about our customers, principally through customer surveys. Based on this information, we believe over 70% of our core customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without a specific item or brand in mind to purchase. Value dominates top of mind awareness as our customers look to us for savings. Nearly one half of the customers surveyed said their shopping trips to our stores last over 30 minutes, which we interpret as them coming to shop our stores for the treasure hunt. We have improved, and expect to continue to develop, our in store signage and merchandising displays and arrangements. We continue to market to our Buzz Club members, by offering a free online membership and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores. Additionally, in 2009, we launched our Rewards program which is the first true loyalty card program in the Companys history. After enrolling in this program, the customer receives a Rewards card which is to be presented and scanned at the register at time of purchase. After ten qualifying purchases each of $20 or more, the Rewards member will receive a coupon for 20% off a future purchase in our stores. Additionally, members will receive, via email, our ad circulars and other targeted promotional materials. Due to the investments made in our store register systems during 2007 and 2008, each time a Rewards card is scanned we have the technology to record and monitor purchasing behavior. From a marketing perspective in 2010, there are three key initiatives designed to help to build transactions: First, the Rewards program and building the membership base is a key driver to future transaction growth. As of March 1, 2010, we have over 1.4 million Rewards members. To date, stores with the highest amount of Rewards member signups or penetration are seeing incremental transaction lifts in the low single digits. During 2010, we will be implementing technology that will enable us to offer our members targeted messages or promotions based on their specific buying patterns. Second, using our ad circulars and promotional pricing to create more buzzbuilders (excitement) could help increase transactions. The excitement created by buzzbuilders is predominantly achieved through price but uniqueness of item can be a factor as well. Lastly, we have expanded the mix of tender accepted in our stores and effective February 2010, we began accepting the American Express card. American Express cardholders typically have higher income demographics than other cardholders and we believe the marketing efforts and support from the vendor could increase our market share in that demographic. From a store operations perspective, we began the company wide rollout of our Ready for Business program in 2009. The program has certain performance criteria and standards aimed at improving the consistency of visual presentation, merchandise recovery efforts, and overall store cleanliness. Ready for Business also focuses on improvements in our employee training programs and hiring practices. This higher level of expectation and accountability within our store operations team increased the turnover rate of our district managers, store managers, and assistant store managers in 2009 and required us to recruit new talent to the organization. In 2010, we believe that continued focus on Ready for Business standards and the investment made in talent in 2009 could help to improve sales through both the size of the average basket and the number of transactions. Additionally, with a higher level of confidence in the discipline on store standards and a higher caliber management team in place, we have identified certain investments in both store layout and store improvement capital which we will be executing throughout 2010. This effort will address approximately 120 stores with potential upside sales opportunities. Real EstateFrom the beginning of fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008, we slowed our rate of new store openings based on our belief that many of the real estate locations available to us in the marketplace were too expensive and as such the return on investment would not be satisfactory to our shareholders. During 2006 through 2008, we opened a total of only 39 new stores (11 in 2006, 7 in 2007, and 21 in 2008). During the same timeframe, we closed 101 existing stores (37 in 2006, 29 in 2007, and 35 in 2008) for various reasons including lack of profitability, proposed new lease terms where rents were escalating and landlords were unwilling to renegotiate terms, or relocating the store to a potentially more productive location. 22 As a result of improvements in our store productivity and overall profitability over the last four years and the softening of the real estate market, we were able to grow our store base in 2009 for the first time in the last five years. We opened 52 new stores and closed 30 stores in 2009. The majority of our new store openings (41) were what we refer to as traditional stores, which are secondary or tertiary real estate normally located in retail strip centers. Additionally, in 2009 we tested two new store initiatives: A locations (8) and a smaller store concept (3). Generally speaking, new store openings performed very well in 2009 with A locations exceeding our expectations, traditional stores overall meeting our expectations and our small store test producing mixed results. We believe we have opportunities with respect to the lease options included in our existing store leases. As stated in Item 2. Properties, of this Form 10 K, we have 230 store leases that expire in 2010. We expect to close approximately 40 of these stores, some of which have not performed to our expectations, some of which have no more lease renewal options and we expect the landlord to choose a different tenant, and some of which we anticipate exiting by our choice in favor of relocating the store to a new location in a nearby area. For our remaining approximately 190 store locations with 2010 lease expirations, we expect to exercise our renewal option or negotiate more favorable lease renewal terms sufficient enough to enable us to achieve an acceptable return on our investment. Our real estate strategy has included the following additional investments in our existing fleet of stores in order to improve operating efficiency: In 2007 and 2008, we invested approximately $38 million to implement our new point of sale register system in all of our existing stores with the expected benefits to include more timely and accurate sales and inventory information, improved customer service through faster speed at checkout, lower repair and maintenance costs, and improved labor efficiency through the use of hand held technology. In 2007 and 2008, we invested approximately $7 million in store retrofits and new merchandise fixtures at approximately 110 of our stores to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications, specifically Furniture. In 2009, we tested a new store layout in approximately 20 locations, predominantly in Columbus, Ohio. The layout test was designed to improve the ease of shopping our stores. It features Consumables more prominently in our store and improves the visual sight lines within the store. The customer reaction indicated that the store seemed better organized, cleaner, and has improved lighting, wider aisles, and generally presents merchandise more effectively. Based on our evaluation of the test results, we will expand this program to an additional 105 stores in 2010. Also in 2009, we made certain investments, both capital and expense, in a Food Refresh program. The program emphasizes cleanliness and merchandise presentation in our food departments and it included new or refinished fixtures in approximately one half of our stores while all stores received new signage and shelf labeling. Based on feedback from our customers, we believe improved cleanliness, better fixtures, and dedicated associate staffing to maintain a better merchandise presentation instills customer confidence in the quality and freshness of our food merchandise. In 2010, we plan to increase the level of new store openings to 80 new stores and expect to close approximately 40 stores resulting in net store growth of 40 locations, or 3% of the total store base. In terms of the breakout of what types of stores we expect to open, the availability of space for our traditional locations remains good, rents are reasonable, and we estimate we will open approximately 50 traditional stores in 2010. In regards to A locations, we see a meaningful opportunity for growth in 2010 and estimate that we will open approximately 30 new A locations this year. This is a major step forward for our company and has been made possible by the softening in the commercial real estate market and the strength of our financial performance over the last several years. Additionally, a higher quality and more branded merchandise assortment along with improvements in store standards and customer service have given us the confidence that we can be successful in these locations with a new customer base that has a somewhat higher level of expectations in terms of the in store shopping experience. During 2009, we learned a great deal through our small store test about the operational aspects and the merchandising changes or edits that are critical in this size of store. We will continue to make modifications to our 3 test stores and monitor their progress. Along the way in 2010, we may also add a couple of stores to the test. 23 Cost Structure Our goal each year is to continue to generate expense leverage (lower expenses as a percent of net sales). We believe that several operational changes we have made, which we continue to refine, have significantly contributed to the achievement of our leverage goals. Some of the operational changes made include: Reduced inventory levels at our stores and regional distribution centers. Purchased and distributed merchandise to our stores in optimal quantities and pack sizes to minimize handling in our distribution centers and stores. Timed receipt of merchandise in stores closer to the expected display dates in order to avoid excessive handling merchandise. Increased the percentage of merchandise that arrives in our stores pre ticketed and pre packaged for efficient display and sale. Refined our staffing and payroll scheduling models in our stores, and Implemented several initiatives which lowered our distribution and outbound transportation expenses. As a result of these operational changes and certain other initiatives in the business, our overall expenses as a percent of sales have declined by 480 basis points (2009 expense rate of 33.7% versus 2005 expense rate of 38.5%). For 2010, we are forecasting an expense rate of 33.4% to 33.6%. Expense dollars are expected to decline in the areas of advertising, utilities, and insurance based on certain company specific initiatives developed by management. Store expenses along with distribution and transportation costs are expected to leverage as dollar growth in these areas is forecasted to be at a slower rate than our anticipated sales growth. Partially offsetting this leverage, we believe costs will increase and deleverage areas such as occupancy, depreciation, and equity related compensation expense, given the significant increase in our share price over the last 12 months. Discontinued OperationsWe continue to incur exit related costs for some of the 130 stores we closed in 2005 that we have classified as discontinued operations, specifically on the stores where lease obligations remain. We also report certain activity related to our prior ownership of the KB Toys business in discontinued operations. See note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of all of our discontinued operations. Share Repurchase ProgramIn December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our common shares. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2009. On March 2, 2010, based upon the strength of our operating performance and cash flow generation during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 and our estimated cash flow for fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million increase to our $150.0 million program bringing the total authorization of the 2010 Repurchase Program to $400.0 million. On March 10, 2010, we utilized $150.0 million of the authorization to execute an accelerated share repurchase transaction which reduced our common shares outstanding by 3.6 million. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based upon the volume weighted average price of our stock over a predetermined period and will not be known until that period ends and a final settlement occurs. The final settlement could increase or decrease the 3.6 million shares initially reduced from our outstanding common shares. The remaining $250.0 million will be utilized to repurchase shares in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. Common shares acquired through the 2010 Repurchase Program will be available to meet obligations under equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes. The 2010 Repurchase Program will continue until exhausted and will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash generated during fiscal 2010 or, if needed, by drawing on our $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. 24 2009 COMPARED TO 2008Net SalesAs previously discussed, we manage our business on the basis of one segment: broadline closeout retailing. We report net sales information for six merchandise categories. Net sales by merchandise category, as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 were as follows: 2009 2008 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,456,370 30.8 % $ 1,410,383 30.4 % $ 45,987 3.3 % Home 717,744 15.2 713,103 15.4 4,641 0.7 Furniture 716,785 15.2 698,276 15.0 18,509 2.7 Hardlines 677,790 14.3 646,563 13.9 31,227 4.8 Seasonal 591,321 12.5 585,025 12.6 6,296 1.1 Other 566,762 12.0 591,933 12.7 (25,171 ) (4.3 ) Net sales $ 4,726,772 100.0 % $ 4,645,283 100.0 % $ 81,489 1.8 % Net sales increased $81.5 million, or 1.8%, to $4,726.8 million in 2009 compared to $4,645.3 million in 2008. The increase in net sales was principally due to our comparable store sales increase of 0.7%, or approximately $32 million, and non comparable store sales, which increased by approximately $37 million. Our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of the current fiscal year. This calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria. The average number of stores in operation throughout 2009 and 2008 was approximately 1,354 stores and 1,356 stores, respectively. Following a comparable store sales decrease of 1.5% through the first half of 2009, sales trends improved resulting in a comparable store sales increase of 2.8% in the second half of 2009 thereby producing an annual comparable store sales increase of 0.7%. Comparable store sales increased in the low to mid single digits from September through January due to improvements in our merchandise offering, and improved discretionary spending trends as we met the first anniversary of the significant economic turmoil that began to impact us in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2008. Specifically, comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. Based on these trends and sales results of February 2010, we estimate 2010 comparable store sales will increase in the range of 3% to 4%. From a merchandise perspective, sales in most major merchandise categories increased in 2009 compared to 2008. Consumables continued its consistent sales growth throughout the year. Consumers continued to seek out value when shopping for the everyday household use items that we offer in our Consumables business. We believe our strategy of offering name brands at competitive prices led to this consistently positive net sales performance in the Consumables category. The Home category net sales consistently underperformed through the second fiscal quarter. However, accelerating sales trends in the second half of 2009 due to certain merchandise assortment changes and the improvement experienced in consumer discretionary spending trends led to a total sales increase for fiscal 2009. The Furniture category also underperformed through the third fiscal quarter principally due to lower sales in our mattress department. However, new key items in upholstery and case goods along with a sales rebound in our mattress department led to a fourth fiscal quarter comparable store sales increase in the high single digits leading to our overall sales increase of 2.7% for 2009. The Hardlines category continued its increase in net sales driven by sales of electronics, particularly DVDs, cameras and televisions. The Seasonal category net sales produced positive results in the second half of the year due to a comparable sales increase of our Christmas merchandise in the fourth fiscal quarter. The Other category sales decline is primarily due to three large closeout deals (drugstore merchandise, furniture, and apparel) that occurred in 2008; fewer closeout deals were sold in the Other category in 2009. Partly offsetting the closeout deals decline was an increase in toy department sales. 25 Gross MarginGross margin dollars increased $61.9 million, or 3.3%, to $1,919.3 million in 2009 compared to $1,857.4 million in 2008. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 40.6% in 2009 compared to 40.0% in 2008. The increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher gross margin rate and the increase in sales. The increase in gross margin rate increased gross margin dollars by approximately $29 million. Also contributing to the increased gross margin dollars was higher net sales of $81.5 million, which increased gross margin dollars by approximately $33 million. The gross margin rate increase was principally due to higher initial mark up on merchandise sold, lower inbound freight costs and a lower shrink accrual rate. We achieved lower inbound freight costs in 2009 because of lower diesel fuel costs, lower ocean freight rates, renegotiated carrier rates, and careful review of the mode of transportation to find the most efficient method to ship goods to our distribution centers. The gross margin rate also benefitted from favorable adjustments to the shrink accrual as physical inventories were completed at our stores. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.7 turns in 2009 compared to 3.6 turns in 2008. Based on historical results and current economic conditions, we expect our 2010 gross margin rate to be approximately 40.6%, or flat compared to 2009, as strength in initial mark up, lower shrink costs and a slightly lower markdown rate are expected to be offset by rising freight costs, both import and domestic. Based on the current general economic trends, our vendors may be negatively impacted by insufficient availability of credit to fund their operations or insufficient demand for their products, which may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Additionally, the general economic conditions have caused a higher level of uncertainty of our forecasted sales results, and thus, demand for our merchandise could differ materially from our expectation causing us to under or over buy certain merchandise, which may result in customer dissatisfaction or excessive markdowns required to liquidate the merchandise. Selling and Administrative ExpensesSelling and administrative expenses increased $8.5 million, or 0.6%, to $1,532.4 million in 2009 compared to $1,523.9 million in 2008. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally caused by an increase in store occupancy expenses of $15.5 million, higher employee benefit expenses of $7.7 million, higher share based compensation expense of $4.8 million, litigation related expenses of $4.6 million, and bonuses of $4.4 million. These items were partially offset by a $23.4 million decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs and a $6.1 million decrease in advertising expenses. The increase in store occupancy expenses is primarily due to higher rents and real estate taxes related to the leases of the 73 new stores opened in 2009 and 2008. The increase in employee benefits is principally due to higher paid health insurance claims and pension expense. The increase in share based compensation is primarily due to our acceleration of vesting of restricted stock grants based on our profit performance in 2009. In 2009, we accrued $4.0 million for a certain legal settlement agreement (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The $4.4 million increase of bonuses was directly related to our performance. The decline in distribution and outbound transportation costs is a result of lower inventory levels, the integration of our Ohio and California furniture distribution operations into our regional distribution centers in July 2008 and 2009, respectively, the renegotiation of dedicated carrier contracts with more favorable rates starting in August 2009, more efficient operations due to increased volume of cartons, and the impact of decreased diesel fuel costs. Advertising expenses decreased due to renegotiated printing contracts with more favorable terms, reduced local advertising, and reduced newspaper distributions. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32.4% in 2009 compared to 32.8% in 2008. The decrease of 0.4% is primarily due to the effect of the increase in sales of 1.8% as selling and administrative expense dollars increased 0.6% as discussed above. Our future selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales rate is dependent upon many factors including our level of net sales, our ability to implement additional efficiencies, principally in our store and distribution center operations, and fluctuating commodity prices, such as diesel fuel, which directly affects our outbound transportation cost. In 2010, we expect expense leverage based on company specific initiatives to lower costs and the leveraging impact of our estimated comparable store sales increase of 3% to 4%. We expect expense dollars to decrease in the areas of advertising, utilities, and health insurance based on certain company specific initiatives and program changes. We estimate dollars will increase in store payroll, and distribution and transportation; however, the increase is forecasted to be at a lower rate than our estimated total sales growth of 5% to 6%. Additionally, we are forecasting slight deleverage in the areas of occupancy, depreciation, and equity related compensation expenses. 26 Depreciation ExpenseDepreciation expense decreased $3.7 million, or 4.7%, to $74.9 million in 2009 compared to $78.6 million for 2008. The decrease in depreciation expense was principally related to our stores and was due to assets becoming fully depreciated since the prior year. Many of these fully depreciated assets were placed in service in 2003 or 2004 and had five year estimated service lives. Compared to more recent years, capital expenditures were significantly higher in 2003 and 2004, principally due to store remodels and a higher number of store openings in 2003 and 2004. For 2010, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $115 million. Using this assumption and the run rate of depreciation on our existing property and equipment, we expect 2010 depreciation expense to be $80 million to $85 million, which would represent an increase from the $74.9 million of depreciation expense in 2009. Interest ExpenseInterest expense decreased $3.5 million to $1.8 million in 2009 compared to $5.3 million in 2008. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to lower average borrowings (including capital leases) of $8.6 million in 2009 compared to average borrowings of $151.8 million in 2008. The higher average borrowings in 2008 were driven principally by the acquisition of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase programs which were completed in 2008. In 2009, cash flow provided by operations was sufficient to repay the borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our average effective interest rate of 1.8% in 2009 was lower than our average effective interest rate of 3.5% in 2008. The decrease in the average effective interest rate, which resulted from generally lower rates in the overall short term interest rate markets, decreased our interest expense by approximately $0.1 million in 2009. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income increased $0.1 million in 2009 to $0.2 million compared to $0.1 million in 2008. The increase in interest and investment income was caused by the increase in funds available to invest in 2009 compared to 2008, partly offset by a decrease in investment yield. Our average invested amount in 2009 was $68.9 million compared to $3.6 million in 2008. In 2009, we invested primarily in deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments, including money market funds and variable rate demand notes. We held $245.0 million of investments at the end of 2009. Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 37.7% for 2009 compared to 38.0% for 2008. The net decrease in 2009 was primarily driven by the release of the valuation allowance on unrealized capital losses in contrast to an increase in the valuation allowance in 2008. We anticipate our 2010 effective income tax rate to be within a range of 38.0% to 39.0%. Discontinued OperationsLoss from discontinued operations was $1.0 million, net of tax, in 2009 compared to $3.3 million, net of tax, in 2008. The 2009 loss from discontinued operations was primarily due to the KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, we obtained assignment of a lease for the former KB II corporate office and recorded a charge of $0.7 million, net of tax, in loss from discontinued operations. The remaining $0.3 million loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2009 pertained to other KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations. KB II declared bankruptcy again in December 2008. As a result of this bankruptcy filing, KB II rejected 31 store leases for which we believe we have an indemnification obligation. The 2008 loss from discontinued operations of $3.3 million, net of tax, was comprised of $3.0 million, net of tax, for the KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligations and $0.3 million, net of tax, for exit related costs on the remaining 2005 closed stores which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. 27 2008 COMPARED TO 2007Net SalesNet sales by merchandise category, as a percentage of total net sales, and net sales change in dollars and percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 were as follows: 2008 2007 Change ($ in thousands) Consumables $ 1,410,383 30.4 % $ 1,339,433 28.8 % $ 70,950 5.3 % Home 713,103 15.4 783,047 16.8 (69,944 ) (8.9 ) Furniture 698,276 15.0 687,292 14.8 10,984 1.6 Hardlines 646,563 13.9 629,119 13.5 17,444 2.8 Seasonal 585,025 12.6 597,933 12.8 (12,908 ) (2.2 ) Other 591,933 12.7 619,478 13.3 (27,545 ) (4.4 ) Net sales $ 4,645,283 100.0 % $ 4,656,302 100.0 % $ (11,019 ) (0.2 ) % Net sales decreased $11.0 million, or 0.2%, to $4,645.3 million in 2008 compared to $4,656.3 million in 2007. There were fewer open stores in 2008 which caused a decrease of $34.0 million partially offset by our comparable store sales increase of 0.5%, which increased sales by $23.0 million. Our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of 2008. This calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria. Following a comparable store sales increase of 3.1% in the first half of 2008, sales trends softened resulting in a comparable store sales decrease of 1.9% in the second half of 2008. We believe that our comparable store sales results in the third and fourth fiscal quarters were in part due to the worsening general economic trends. From a merchandise perspective, the Consumables, Hardlines, and Furniture categories net sales increased while net sales of Home, Other, and Seasonal declined. Consumables continued its consistent sales growth throughout the year. As the year progressed, consumers chose to seek out value when shopping for the everyday household use items that we offer in our Consumables business. We believe our strategy of offering name brands at competitive prices has led to this consistently positive net sales performance in the Consumables category. The Hardlines category increase in net sales was driven by the availability in the second half of 2008 of multiple closeout deals containing higher ticket electronics, highlighted by significant values on items such as popular video games and personal computer laptops from national brand manufacturers. The Furniture category increase was driven by sales of mattresses, which were attributable to the customer response throughout the year especially when promotional pricing was coupled with holiday events such as the Labor Day mattress promotion. The Home category net sales consistently underperformed throughout the year continuing a trend which began in the first half of 2007. We believe our customers elected to defer purchases of this type of merchandise. The Other category sales decline is primarily due to lower sales of toys principally in the latter half of the year, when toys represent a relatively larger portion of our total net sales. The lower toys sales results were partially offset within the Other category by higher sales driven by closeout deals of licensed kids underwear during the first half of the year. The Seasonal category net sales produced positive results in the first half of the year for lawn & garden and summer merchandise; however, the second half of the years net sales underperformed due to lower comparable store sales for Christmas, Halloween, and harvest. Because the Christmas selling season represents a higher portion of the total years sales in this category, the decline in Christmas merchandise sales drove the category sales lower for the year. Gross MarginGross margin dollars increased $17.1 million, or 0.9%, to $1,857.4 million in 2008 compared to $1,840.3 million in 2007. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 40.0% in 2008 compared to 39.5% in 2007. The increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to the higher gross margin rate, which increased gross margin dollars by approximately $21 million. Partially offsetting the higher gross margin rate was lower net sales of $11.0 million, which reduced gross margin dollars by approximately $4 million. The gross margin rate increase of 50 basis points was primarily due to higher initial markup on merchandise and favorable shrink results partially offset by higher markdowns and the mix impact of our higher net sales in merchandise categories, such as Consumables, that have lower gross margin rates. The improvement in initial markup was due in part to a drugstore liquidation deal, a furniture closeout from a large national brand, and an overall favorable deal environment for closeout merchandise. In addition, initial markup was higher in 2008 due to our Home Event, which we offered in our stores principally during the first half of the year. The Home Event merchandise was included in the Furniture category and Home category. Shrink was lower principally due to favorable physical inventory results. Higher markdowns were attributable in part to planned markdowns associated with a drugstore liquidation deal, a furniture closeout from a large national brand, and our Home Event merchandise. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.6 turns in 2008 compared to 3.5 turns in 2007. 28 Selling and Administrative ExpensesSelling and administrative expenses increased $8.5 million, or 0.6%, to $1,523.9 million in 2008 compared to $1,515.4 million in 2007. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally caused by an increase in medical plan expenses of $9.7 million, higher share based compensation expense of $5.5 million, the 2007 partial recovery of the HCC Note investment of $5.2 million (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the HCC Note), the 2007 reduction in selling and administrative expenses due to the receipt of insurance proceeds for 2005 hurricane claims of $4.9 million, and higher store utilities of $3.4 million. These items were partially offset by a $17.1 million decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs and a $15.8 million decrease in store payroll costs. The increase in medical plan expenses is principally due to higher paid claims. The increase in share based compensation is principally due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) under the modified prospective method of accounting in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 and our acceleration of vesting of stock options in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005. Higher store utilities costs were driven by colder weather this winter and higher average commodity rates throughout the majority of 2008. The decline in distribution and outbound transportation costs is a result of lower inventory levels, fewer cartons processed through our distribution centers (as discussed above), more one way trips to the stores resulting in higher shipping cost per mile but fewer miles traveled and, beginning in July 2008, the integration of our Ohio furniture distribution operation into four of our regional distribution centers. Partially offsetting these favorable distribution and outbound transportation costs was the impact of higher diesel fuel prices. Store payroll is lower due to fewer stores and employees and fewer cartons of merchandise resulting from the $11.0 million decline in net sales and the merchandise strategy that involves offering merchandise with slightly higher average item retails. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32.8% in 2008 compared to 32.5% in 2007. Excluding the impact of the $5.2 million partial recovery of the HCC Note and the receipt of hurricane insurance proceeds of $4.9 million, both of which reduced 2007 selling and administrative expenses, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Depreciation ExpenseDepreciation expense decreased $9.9 million, or 11.2 %, to $78.6 million in 2008 compared to $88.5 million for 2007. The decrease was principally related to the five year service life store remodel program assets that were placed in service in 2002 and 2003 and a lower level of capital expenditures in 2006 and 2007. The lower capital expenditures in 2006 and 2007 are principally related to opening seven stores in 2007 and 11 stores in 2006 compared to opening 73, 103, and 86 stores in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In addition, in 2006 and 2007, we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system, which was installed in approximately 700 stores in 2007 and in all of our remaining stores in 2008. As a result of the installation of the new point of sale register system, we reduced the estimated remaining service life on our old register system, effective the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. The impact of this service life reduction was to recognize $4.1 million in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2008 as additional depreciation expense associated with the old cash registers. Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased $2.8 million to $5.3 million in 2008 compared to $2.5 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average borrowings of $151.8 million in 2008 compared to average borrowings of $37.9 million in 2007. The higher average borrowings caused interest expense to be higher by approximately $4 million. The higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase programs. Our average effective interest rate of 3.5% in 2008 was lower than our average effective interest rate of 6.6% in 2007. The decrease in the average effective interest rate, which resulted from generally lower rates in the overall short term interest rate markets, decreased our interest expense by approximately $1.0 million in 2008. 29 Interest and Investment IncomeInterest and investment income decreased $5.1 million in 2008 to $0.1 million compared to $5.2 million in 2007. The decline in interest and investment income was caused by the reduction in funds available to invest in 2008 compared to 2007. Our average invested amount in 2008 was $3.6 million compared to $130.4 million in 2007. The decline in funds available for investment was caused by the $750 million of share repurchases under our 2007 Share Repurchase Programs during the period March 2007 through February 2008. In 2007, we invested primarily in money market type investments that were considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds. We did not hold any investment balances at the end of 2008. Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 38.0% for 2008 compared to 36.8% for 2007. The net increase in 2008 was driven by a decrease in nontaxable municipal interest income, the increase in the valuation allowance on unrealized capital losses (versus a net decrease in the valuation allowance in 2007), and a change in the jurisdictional earnings mix, partially offset by the settlement of certain income tax matters. Discontinued OperationsLoss from discontinued operations was $3.3 million, net of tax, in 2008 compared to income from discontinued operations of $7.3 million, net of tax in 2007. The 2008 loss from discontinued operations of $3.3 million, net of tax, was comprised of $3.0 million, net of tax, for the KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligation (as defined in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and $0.3 million, net of tax, for exit related costs on the remaining 2005 closed stores which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. KB Toys declared bankruptcy again in December 2008. As a result of this bankruptcy filing, KB Toys rejected 31 store leases for which we believe we have an indemnification obligation. Based on the lease data for these 31 stores and using our prior experience with these matters, we estimated a KB II Bankruptcy Lease Obligation of $3.0 million, net of tax. The income from discontinued operations in 2007 was principally comprised of 1) the release of our KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations of $6.6 million, net of tax, 2) the recognition of $1.1 million of proceeds, net of tax, from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for KB I Bankruptcy Lease Obligations and the Pittsfield, Massachusetts distribution center (formerly owned by KB Toys) mortgage guarantee, and 3) exit related costs on the 130 closed stores of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to expenses on the portion of the 130 stores where the leases have not been terminated. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYOn April 28, 2009, we entered into the 2009 Credit Agreement, a new $500 million three year unsecured credit facility that replaced the 2004 Credit Agreement. The 2009 Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on April 28, 2012. In connection with our entry into the 2009 Credit Agreement, we paid an aggregate amount of $5.6 million of bank fees and expenses, which are being amortized over the term of the agreement. Proceeds from borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain of our indebtedness. The 2009 Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sublimit and a $30 million swing loan sublimit. The interest rates, pricing and fees under the 2009 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating. The 2009 Credit Agreement allows us to select our interest rate for each borrowing from two different interest rate options. The interest rate options are generally derived from the prime rate or LIBOR. We may prepay revolving loans made under the 2009 Credit Agreement. The 2009 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. A violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the 2009 Credit Agreement that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2009 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2009 Credit Agreement. As of January 30, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenants of the 2009 Credit Agreement. 30 The primary sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations and, as necessary, borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement. Our net income and cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, and operating profit margins. Our net sales are typically highest during the Christmas selling season (during our fourth fiscal quarter). Generally, our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter. We have typically funded those requirements with borrowings under our credit facility. At January 30, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding under the 2009 Credit Agreement and, after taking into account the reduction in availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $50.1 million, the borrowings available under the 2009 Credit Agreement were $449.9 million. We anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than $75.0 million through the end of June 2010, all of which will be comprised of letters of credit, excluding any impact from the execution of the 2010 Repurchase Program. In 2009, our total indebtedness (outstanding borrowings and letters of credit) peaked at approximately $120.8 million in early February 2009 under our 2004 Credit Agreement. Working capital was $580.4 million at January 30, 2010. Whenever our liquidity position requires us to borrow funds under the 2009 Credit Agreement, we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis. The daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position, which is generally driven by the following components of our operations: 1) cash inflows such as cash or credit card receipts collected from stores for merchandise sales and other miscellaneous deposits; and 2) cash outflows such as check clearings for the acquisition of merchandise, payroll and other operating expenses, wire and other electronic transactions for merchandise purchases, income and other taxes, employee benefits, and other miscellaneous disbursements. We use the 2009 Credit Agreement, as necessary, to provide funds for ongoing and seasonal working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, and other expenditures. In addition, we use the 2009 Credit Agreement to provide letters of credit for various operating and regulatory requirements, a significant portion of which consists of letters of credit required as a result of our self funded insurance programs. Given the seasonality of our business, the amount of borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors, including our operating financial performance, the time of year, and our need to increase merchandise inventory levels prior to the peak selling season. Cash provided by operating activities was $392.0 million, $211.1 million and $307.9 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The 2009 increase in cash provided by operating activities of $180.9 was principally due to higher net income and improved accounts payable leverage (accounts payable divided by inventories). Accounts payable leverage improved due to the lower amount of inventories and our efforts to continue to work with our import and domestic vendors to further extend payment terms. The 2008 decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $96.8 million was primarily due to the decline in accounts payable leverage as accounts payable decreased more than inventory decreased. Accounts payable decreased because of a shift in our merchandise mix to purchases from vendors with shorter payment terms, many of whom offered us cash discounts. Our cash paid for income taxes was $106.0 million, $92.4 million, and $65.8 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The increases in income taxes paid were a direct result of higher operating profits and partly impacted by the timing of required tax payments relative to the fiscal years in which these profits were earned. Our total contributions to the Pension Plan were $10.8 million, $11.3 million, and $0.9 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively. These contributions were made to increase the funded level of the Pension Plan. Based on assumptions about our 2010 operating performance that we have discussed above in MD&A, we expect cash provided by operating activities to be approximately $315 million in 2010. However, based on the current general economic conditions, consumers may elect to defer or forego purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news. Reduced consumer spending may reduce our net sales, which could lower our profitability and limit our ability to convert merchandise inventories to cash. Cash used in investing activities was $77.9 million, $88.2 million, and $58.8 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The 2009 decrease in cash used in investing activities of $10.3 and the 2008 increase in cash used in investing activities of $29.4 million was principally due to fluctuations in capital expenditures year from year. The 2009 capital expenditures were driven by the investments in 52 new store openings and the continued development of our SAP for Retail system. The 2008 capital expenditures were driven by the investments in 21 new store openings, our SAP for Retail system, which included development costs and additional payments for hardware and licensing fees, the completion of the installation of new cash registers in all of our stores, and the acquisition of two store properties that were previously leased. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $115 million in 2010, comprised principally of maintenance capital of approximately $35 million to $40 million, real estate capital of approximately $35 million to $40 million driven by our plan to open 80 new stores, and other investments of approximately $40 million which include, among other things, capital to refresh 120 stores, investment in energy management systems for 700 stores, and our continued software development of the SAP for Retail system. 31 Cash used in financing activities was $65.1 million, $125.2 million, and $493.7 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In 2009, cash used in financing activities was principally due to the repayment of borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility of $60.7 million and the payment of bank fees of $5.6 million associated with our entry into the 2009 Credit Agreement, partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $4.9 million. In 2008, cash used in financing activities was principally due to net payments on our prior bank credit facility of $102.0 million and $37.5 million of payments for treasury shares acquired under our November 2007 Repurchase Program, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10.9 million. In December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $150 million of our common shares. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2009. On March 2, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million increase to our $150.0 million program bringing the total authorization of the 2010 Repurchase Program to $400.0 million. On March 10, 2010, we utilized $150.0 million of the authorization to execute an accelerated share repurchase transaction which reduced our common shares outstanding by 3.6 million. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based upon the volume weighted average price of our stock over a predetermined period and will not be known until that period ends and a final settlement occurs. The final settlement could increase or decrease the 3.6 million shares initially reduced from our outstanding common shares. The terms of the ASR restrict us from declaring a dividend prior to its completion, which is currently scheduled to be no later than January 26, 2011. The remaining $250 million will be utilized to repurchase shares in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. Common shares acquired through the 2010 Repurchase Program will be available to meet obligations under equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes. The 2010 Repurchase Program will continue until exhausted and will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash generated during fiscal 2010 or, if needed, by drawing on our $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Based on historical and expected financial results, we believe that we have or, if necessary, have the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing and seasonal working capital requirements, proposed capital expenditures, new projects, and currently maturing obligations. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at January 30, 2010: Payments Due by Period (1) Less than More than Total 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years 5 years (In thousands) Obligations under bank credit facility (2) $ $ $ $ $ Operating lease obligations (3) (4) 917,454 263,782 386,664 206,795 60,213 Capital lease obligations (4) 3,707 2,352 1,220 135 Purchase obligations (4) (5) 839,587 676,012 113,544 49,354 677 Other long term liabilities (6) 46,652 16,317 7,347 2,371 20,617 Total contractual obligations (7) $ 1,807,400 $ 958,463 $ 508,775 $ 258,655 $ 81,507 (1) The disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report. Those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate; consequently, the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur. Variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from the actually incurred include, but are not limited to: the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration; fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation; the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report; fluctuations in third party fees, governmental charges, or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors; and the exercise of renewal options under, or the automatic renewal of, contracts that provide for the same. 32 (2) Obligations under bank credit facility consist of the borrowings outstanding under the 2009 Credit Agreement. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $50.1 million at January 30, 2010. Approximately $46.8 million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit; accordingly, they have been excluded from this table. The remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in Purchase Obligations. For a further discussion, see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (3) Operating lease obligations include, among other items, leases for retail stores, warehouse space, data center, offices, and certain computer and other business equipment. The future minimum commitments for retail store, data center, office, and warehouse space operating leases are $687.6 million. For a further discussion of leases, see note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. In connection with our store lease obligations, we estimated that future obligations for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance were $221.9 million at January 30, 2010. We have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Those assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: use of historical data to estimate our future obligations; calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold; and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data. The remaining lease obligation of $8.0 million relates primarily to operating leases for computer and other business equipment. (4) For purposes of the lease and purchase obligation disclosures, we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date, and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension. Where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term, we disclosed in the table our minimum commitment under such obligation, such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term, due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing leases. (5) Purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at $478.5 million, the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of January 31, 2010. In addition, we have a purchase commitment for future inventory purchases totaling $138.5 million at January 31, 2010. While we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment, we have included, for purposes of this tabular disclosure, we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods, as purchases that will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation. The remaining $222.6 million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation, information technology, print advertising, energy procurement, and other store security, supply, and maintenance commitments. (6) Other long term liabilities include $15.4 million for expected contributions to the Pension Plan and our nonqualified, unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan (Supplemental Pension Plan), $17.1 million for obligations related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, $13.4 million for unrecognized tax benefits, and $0.8 million for closed store lease termination costs. Pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans). We have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions. We have included unrecognized tax benefits of $2.6 million for payments expected in 2010 and $10.8 million of timing related income tax uncertainties anticipated to reverse in 2010. Unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $20.9 million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments. Our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms. (7) The obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities, guarantees, and indemnities related to the KB Toys business. For further discussion, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 33 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor a discussion of the KB Bankruptcy Lease Obligations, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Because the KB Toys business filed for bankruptcy again in December 2008 and liquidated all of its store operations, we accrued a contingent liability on our balance sheet at January 30, 2010, in the amount of $4.8 million for 31 KB Toys store leases for which we may have an indemnification or guarantee obligation and a former KB Toys corporate office lease for which we took an assignment in 2009. Because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability, our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, judgments, and assumptions, including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.Because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates, judgments, and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies, including the recently adopted accounting standards and recent accounting standards future adoptions, are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Merchandise InventoriesMerchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period. The average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear slow moving inventory, the estimated allowance for shrinkage, and the estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and prior or future gross margin. These estimates are based on historical experience and current information. When management determines the salability of merchandise inventories is diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, the age of merchandise, and seasonal trends. Timing of holidays within fiscal periods, weather, and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year. The inventory allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories, charged to cost of sales, and calculated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period. Such estimates are based on our historical and current year inventory results. Independent physical inventory counts are taken at each store once a year. During 2010, the majority of these counts occur between January and September. As physical inventories are completed, actual results are recorded and new go forward shrink accrual rates are established based on individual store historical results. Thus, the shrink accrual rate will be adjusted throughout the January through September inventory cycle based on actual results. At January 30, 2010, a 10% difference in our shrink reserve would have affected gross margin, operating profit and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $4 million. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, we have loss prevention programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage. 34 Long Lived AssetsOur long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment. We perform annual impairment reviews of our long lived assets at the store level. When we perform the annual impairment reviews, we first determine which stores had impairment indicators present. We use actual historical cash flows to determine which stores had negative cash flows in each of the past two years (on a rolling basis). For each store with two years of negative cash flows, we obtain future cash flow estimates based on operating performance estimates specific to each stores operations that are based on assumptions currently being used to develop our company level operating plans. If the net book value of a stores long lived assets is not recoverable by the expected future cash flows of the store, we estimate the fair value of the stores assets and recognize an impairment charge for the excess net book value of the stores long lived assets over their fair value. The fair value of store assets is estimated based on information available in the marketplace for similar assets. We recognized impairment charges of $0.4 million, $0.1 million, and $0.8 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We believe that our impairment charges are trending lower because we closed a number of underperforming stores at the end of 2005, and continued to close (primarily through non renewal of leases) underperforming stores in 2007, 2008, and 2009. We only identified four stores with impairment indicators as a result of our annual store impairment tests in 2009 and we recognized impairment charges on those stores. Therefore, we do not believe that varying the assumptions used to test for recoverability to estimate fair value of our long lived assets would have a material impact on the impairment charges we incurred in 2009. However, if our future operating results decline significantly, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material (for additional discussion of this risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors A significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our long lived assets and deferred tax assets.). In addition to our annual store impairment reviews, we evaluate our long lived assets at each reporting period to determine whether impairment indicators are present. In 2008, we recorded impairment to the assets of one store as a result of a casualty loss due to hurricane damage. The amount of this impairment is included in the $0.1 million 2008 impairment charge discussed above. Share Based CompensationWe grant stock options and performance based non vested restricted stock to our employees under shareholder approved incentive plans. Share based compensation expense was $20.3 million, $15.5 million, and $9.9 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The increase in share based compensation is primarily due to our acceleration of vesting of restricted stock grants based on our profit performance in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Future share based compensation expense for performance based non vested restricted stock is dependent upon the future number of awards, fair value of our common shares on the grant date, and the estimated vesting period. Future share based compensation expense for stock options is dependent upon the number and terms of future stock option awards and many estimates, judgments and assumptions used in arriving at the fair value of stock options. Future share based compensation expense related to performance based non vested restricted stock and stock options may vary materially from the currently amortizing awards. We estimate the fair value of our stock options using a binomial model. The binomial model takes into account estimates, assumptions, and judgments about our stock price volatility, our dividend yield rate, the risk free rate of return, the contractual term of the option, the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life, and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option. Expected volatility is based on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares. The dividend yield rate on our common shares is assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no immediate plans to do so. The risk free rate is based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of the grant. The expected life is determined from the application of the binomial model and includes assumptions such as the expected employee exercise behavior and our expected turnover rate, which is based on analysis of historical data. 35 Compensation expense for performance based non vested restricted stock awards is recorded over the estimated vesting period based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria. An estimated target achievement date is determined at the time of the award based on historical and forecasted performance of similar measures. We monitor the achievement of the performance targets at each reporting period and make adjustments to the estimated vesting period when our internal models indicate that the estimated achievement date differs from the date being used to amortize expense. Any change in the estimated vesting date results in a prospective change to the related expense by charging the remaining unamortized expense over the remaining expected vesting period at the date the estimate was changed. Income TaxesThe determination of our income tax expense, refunds receivable, income taxes payable, deferred tax assets and liabilities and financial statement recognition, de recognition and or measurement of uncertain tax benefits (for positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns) requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex accounting and multi jurisdictional income tax laws. The effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income (loss) before income taxes, the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income (loss), changes in the income tax laws (which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year), subsequent recognition, de recognition and or measurement of an uncertain tax benefit, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise. We consider all available positive and negative evidence including recent financial results, projected future pretax accounting income from continuing operations and tax planning strategies (when necessary). This evaluation requires us to make assumptions that require significant judgment about the forecasts of future pretax accounting income. The assumptions that we use in this evaluation are consistent with the assumptions and estimates used to develop our consolidated operating financial plans. If we determine that a portion of our deferred tax assets, which principally represent expected future deductions or benefits, are not likely to be realized, we recognize a valuation allowance for our estimate of these benefits which we believe are not likely recoverable. Additionally, changes in tax laws, apportionment of income for state tax purposes, and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets. We evaluate the uncertainty of income tax positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns. When a tax position meets the more likely than not threshold, we recognize economic benefits associated with the position on our consolidated financial statements. The more likely than not recognition threshold is a positive assertion that an enterprise believes it is entitled to economic benefits associated with a tax position. When a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold, or in the case of those positions that do meet the threshold but are measured at less than the full benefit taken on the return, we recognize tax liabilities (or de recognize tax assets, as the case may be). A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have derecognized a tax benefit, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively or ultimately settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or as a result of the evaluation of new information that becomes available. PensionActuarial valuations are used to calculate the estimated expenses and obligations for our Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan. Inherent in the actuarial valuations are several assumptions including discount rate and expected return on plan assets. We review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return. Our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date. In making this estimate, we review rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits. This process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of Aa or better. The expected long term rate of return on assets is derived from detailed periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes, risks (standard deviations) and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long term, prospective rate of return. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for 2009 was 7.3%. A 1.0% decrease in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension cost by $0.2 million. The long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in 2009 was 8.0%. A 1.0% decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by $0.6 million. 36 During 2009, we reclassified $1.7 million, net of tax, from other comprehensive income to expense in our consolidated statement of operations. We recognized a benefit of $0.4 million, net of tax, to other comprehensive income in 2009, principally as a result of the increase in value of investments held by the pension trust. As of January 30, 2010, the accumulated other comprehensive income amount, which was principally unrealized actuarial loss, was $13.1 million loss, net of tax. During 2010, and in future periods, we expect to reclassify approximately $2.0 million from other comprehensive income to expense, assuming we achieve our estimated rate of return on pension plan investments in future periods. Additionally, in the event that we have future settlement events, as occurred in 2009 and 2007, we would expect that the expense related to future settlements would be greater than the $0.2 million and $1.3 million charges in 2009 and 2007, respectively. Insurance and Insurance related ReservesWe are self insured for certain losses relating to property, general liability, workers compensation, and employee medical and dental benefit claims, a portion of which is funded by employees. We purchase stop loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposure in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity. Management makes estimates, judgments, and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially based calculations, including but not limited to, estimated health care cost trends, estimated lag time to report and pay claims, average cost per claim, network utilization rates, network discount rates, and other factors. A 10% change in our self insured liabilities at January 30, 2010 would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $8 million. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a 4.0% discount rate, while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted. A 1.0% change in the discount rate on these liabilities would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $1.5 million. Lease AccountingIn order to recognize rent expense on our leases, we evaluate many factors to identify the lease term such as the contractual term of the lease, our assumed possession date of the property, renewal option periods, and the estimated value of leasehold improvement investments that we are required to make. Based on this evaluation, our lease term is typically the minimum contractually obligated period over which we have control of the property. This term is used because although many of our leases have renewal options, we typically do not incur an economic or contractual penalty in the event of non renewal. Therefore, we typically use the initial minimum lease term for purposes of calculating straight line rent, amortizing deferred rent, and recognizing depreciation expense on our leasehold improvements. COMMITMENTSFor a discussion of commitments, refer to note 3, note 5, note 10, and note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 37 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on investments and on borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement that we make from time to time. We had no borrowings at January 30, 2010 under the 2009 Credit Agreement. An increase of 1.0% in our variable interest rate on our investments and expected future borrowings would not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 38
