Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K, beginning on page F 1. Overview On November 12, 2003, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Biogen, Inc. entered into a merger transaction resulting in Biogen, Inc. becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The business combination was treated as an acquisition of Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation for accounting purposes. In connection with the merger, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation changed its name to Biogen Idec Inc. Biogen Idec combines the complementary strengths of each company to create new standards of care in oncology and immunology. As a global leader in the development, manufacture, and commercialization of novel therapies, we transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare. The merger provides diversification of our product portfolios and revenue bases, strengthens our research and development capabilities, and diversifies our product pipeline in key therapeutic areas. Additionally, we believe our manufacturing capacity will make us an attractive partner for companies seeking to partner on promising biologic products in development. We currently have four commercial products: AVONEX (interferon beta 1a) for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis, or MS; RITUXAN (rituximab) and ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan), both of which treat certain B cell non Hodgkins lymphomas, or B cell NHLs; and AMEVIVE (alefacept) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. We acquired AVONEX and AMEVIVE from Biogen, Inc. We also receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control including sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. RITUXAN is the trade name in the U.S., Canada and Japan for the compound Rituximab. In this Form 10 K, we refer to rituximab, RITUXAN and MabThera collectively as RITUXAN, except where we have otherwise indicated. In addition, we have a pipeline of development stage products and a number of research programs in our core therapeutic areas and in other areas of interest. As a result of the merger, Biogen, Inc. stockholders received 1.15 shares of Biogen Idec common stock for each share of Biogen, Inc. common stock. As a result, Biogen Idec issued approximately 171.9 million shares at a fair value of approximately $6.48 billion (based on the average of the closing price of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporations common stock for the period from two days before through two days after the public announcement of the merger on June 23, 2003). In addition, options to purchase Biogen, Inc. common stock outstanding at November 12, 2003 were assumed by Biogen Idec and converted into options to purchase approximately 20.7 million shares of Biogen Idec common stock at a fair value of approximately $295 million (based on the Black Scholes option pricing model, as described in more detail below). We paid approximately $19.8 million in fees for banking, legal, accounting and tax related services related to the merger. Merger related fees of $21.5 million paid by Biogen, Inc. prior to completion of the merger are not included in this amount as they were expensed as incurred. The total merger purchase price was approximately $6.8 billion. The merger qualified as a tax free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The fair value of Biogen Idecs shares used in determining the purchase price was $37.69 per share based on the average of the closing price of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporations common stock for the period two days before through two days after public announcement of the merger on June 23, 2003. The fair value of stock options assumed by Biogen Idec in the merger was determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: stock price of $37.69, which is the value ascribed to IDEC shares in 39 Table of Contents determining the purchase price; volatility of 40%; risk free interest rate of 1.8%; and an expected life of 4.0 years. The purchase price is as follows (table in thousands): Fair value of Biogen Idec common stock $ 6,480,339 Fair value of replacement stock options 295,399 Cash paid for fractional shares 27 Acquisition related costs 19,833 Total purchase price $ 6,795,598 The estimated purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of November 12, 2003, the date that the merger was consummated (table in thousands): Inventory $ 706,957 Accounts receivable 216,221 Property, plant and equipment 713,719 Acquired identifiable intangible assets 3,664,000 Goodwill 1,151,066 In process research and development 823,000 Deferred stock based compensation 2,261 Other current and long term assets 1,106,112 Assumed liabilities (424,648 ) Increase benefit plan liability to fair value (26,650 ) Deferred tax liabilities arising from fair value adjustments (1,136,440 ) Total purchase price $ 6,795,598 The allocation of the purchase price was based, in part, on a third party valuation of the fair value of in process research and development, identifiable intangible assets, and certain property, plant and equipment. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is allocated to goodwill. See Biogen, Inc. Purchase Price Allocation under Critical Accounting Estimates. The discussions for the year ended December 31, 2003 in this annual report on Form 10 K, unless indicated otherwise, represent our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and include the results of operations of Biogen, Inc. for the period commencing November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003 only. The results of operations of Biogen, Inc. (revenues and expenses) for the period commencing January 1, 2003 through November 12, 2003, unless indicated otherwise, are excluded from this Form 10 K. Comparisons are made to the results of operations of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporations financial condition at December 31, 2002, which only include the historical results of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Product sales United States $ 121,589 $ 13,711 $ Rest of world 49,972 Total product sales 171,561 13,711 Unconsolidated joint business revenue 493,049 385,809 251,428 Royalty revenue 12,010 Corporate partner revenue 2,563 4,702 21,249 Total revenues $ 679,183 $ 404,222 $ 272,677 Product Sales 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) AVONEX $ 142,603 $ $ ZEVALIN 19,602 13,711 AMEVIVE 9,356 Total product sales $ 171,561 $ 13,711 $ AVONEX is the most prescribed therapeutic product in MS worldwide. Globally over 125,000 patients have chosen AVONEX as their treatment of choice. Our results of operations for 2003 include sales of AVONEX for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. During that period, sales of AVONEX generated worldwide revenues of $142.6 million, of which $92.6 million was generated in the United States and $50 million in the rest of the world, primarily the European Union, or EU. Product sales from AVONEX represent approximately 21% of our total revenues in 2003. In February 2002, ZEVALIN became the first radioimmunotherapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain B cell NHLs. ZEVALIN is approved as a treatment for relapsed or refractory low grade, follicular, or transformed B cell NHL including patients with RITUXAN refractory follicular NHL. We launched ZEVALIN in the U.S. in April 2002. In 2003, sales of ZEVALIN generated revenues of $19.6 million in the U.S. as compared to $13.7 million in 2002. Outside the U.S., we have licensed our marketing rights in ZEVALIN to Schering AG. In January 2004, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, or EMEA, the regulatory authority in the EU, granted marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with CD20+ follicular B cell NHL who are refractory to or have relapsed following treatment with RITUXAN. Product sales from ZEVALIN represented approximately 3% of our total revenues in 2003 and 2002, respectively. AMEVIVE was approved in the U.S. in 2003 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Our results of operations for 2003 include sales of AMEVIVE for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. During that period, sales of AMEVIVE generated revenues of $9.4 million, substantially all in the U.S. In February 2003, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, or CPMP, the scientific advisory board of the EMEA, determined that more information was required to approve AMEVIVE in the EU. We withdrew our application for approval. We plan to develop the additional information necessary to obtain approval of AMEVIVE for the treatment of psoriasis in the EU. Developing the data and re filing the application may take several years. Product sales from AMEVIVE represent approximately 1% of our total revenues in 2003. 41 Table of Contents We anticipate that our total product sales in 2004 will be substantially higher than 2003, since revenues from sales of AVONEX and AMEVIVE will be included in our results of operations for all of 2004 as opposed to 2003 when revenues from sales of AVONEX and AMEVIVE were included in our results of operations only for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. See also the risks affecting revenues described in Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Our Revenues Rely Significantly on a Limited Number of Products. Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenue RITUXAN was the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for a cancer therapy indication. RITUXAN is approved for the treatment of various B cell NHLs. RITUXAN is marketed in the U.S. in collaboration with Genentech, Inc. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN and associated costs and expenses are recognized by Genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis. Our share of copromotion profits from U.S. sales was $419.2 million in 2003 compared to $324.5 million in 2002 and $228.6 million in 2001. F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd. sells rituximab outside the U.S., except in Japan, where it copromotes RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd., or Zenyaku. We received royalties on sales of rituximab outside of the U.S. of $67.9 million in 2003 as compared to $45.4 million in 2002 and $14.7 million in 2001, which we include under Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenue. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business arrangement for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, consist of the following: 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Copromotion profits $ 419,197 $ 324,498 $ 228,614 Reimbursement of selling and development expenses 18,400 15,879 8,160 Royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the U.S., including royalties received directly from Roche 67,869 45,432 14,654 RITUXAN clinical data purchased from Roche (9,353 ) Columbia patent royalty and interest payment (3,064 ) $ 493,049 $ 385,809 $ 251,428 Under our agreement with Genentech, our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula has two tiers. We earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met. The profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier. We began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the first quarter of 2003, 2002 and 2001. RITUXAN net sales to third party customers in the US recorded by Genentech for 2003 amounted to $1.36 billion compared to $1.08 billion in 2002 and $779 million in 2001. The increase in 2002 and 2001 was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of B cell NHLs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and increases in the wholesale price of RITUXAN effective March 2002, and March 2001. Our royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. is based on Roche and Zenyakus net sales to third party customers and is recorded with a one quarter lag. The increase in royalty revenues in 2003 is due to higher sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. resulting from increased penetration of foreign markets, including Canada and Japan. During 2003, Genentech purchased certain clinical data from Roche related to RITUXAN supporting potential label expansion. Additionally, in 2003 Genentech and IDEC agreed that payments were owed to Columbia University for royalties related to past sales of RITUXAN in the U.S. As a result, we recognized $2.6 million in royalty payments and $500,000 in interest charges related to these royalties. Total unconsolidated joint business revenue represented 73%, 95% and 92% of our total revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 42 Table of Contents Royalty Revenue We receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control. During 2003, we received approximately $12 million in royalty revenues representing 2% of total revenues. Our royalty revenues on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. are included in Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenue. We receive royalties from Schering Plough Corporation on sales of its alpha interferon products in the U.S. and Italy under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon patents and patent applications. Schering Plough sells its INTRON A (interferon alfa 2b) brand of alpha interferon in the U.S. for a number of indications, including the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Schering Plough also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of hepatitis C, including REBETRON Combination Therapy containing INTRON A and REBETOL (ribavirin, USP), PEG INTRON (peginterferon alfa 2b), a pegylated form of alpha interferon, and PEG INTRON in combination with REBETOL. We hold several important patents related to hepatitis B antigens produced by genetic engineering techniques. These antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis B infection. We receive royalties from sales of hepatitis B vaccines in several countries, including the U.S., from GlaxoSmithKline plc and Merck and Co. Inc. We have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis B rights, on an antigen by antigen and nonexclusive basis, to several diagnostic kit manufacturers, including Abbott Laboratories, the major worldwide marketer of hepatitis B diagnostic kits. We also receive ongoing royalties on sales of the recombinant human growth hormone product, Genotropin, by Pfizer, Inc. in the U.S., Canada and Japan, and on sales of ANGIOMAX (bivalirudin) by The Medicines Company, also known as TMC. TMC sells ANGIOMAX in the U.S. for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. TMC sells ANGIOMAX through distributors in Europe, Canada and Latin America. We anticipate that total royalties revenues we will record in 2004 will be substantially higher compared to our royalty revenues recorded in 2003, since we will be reporting the full years worth of royalty revenues from former Biogen, Inc. operations in 2004 as opposed to royalty revenues for only the period of November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003 as are included in our 2003 results of operations. Corporate Partner Revenues Corporate partner revenues consist of contract revenues and license fees. Corporate partner revenues totaled $2.6 million in 2003 compared to $4.7 million in 2002 and $21.2 million in 2001. Corporate partner revenues represented less than 1%, approximately 1% and approximately 8% of total revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in corporate partner revenues in 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to decreased research and development funding in 2002 under our collaborations with Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Of Tokyo, or Taisho, as a result of the termination of our collaboration with Taisho in 2002, and under our collaborations with Seikagaku Corporation, or Seikagaku. Additionally, in 2001, we recognized a $5.0 million payment received from Schering AG when the EMEA accepted for filing the submission of an application for approval of ZEVALIN in the EU and $3.3 million of revenues resulting from the implementation of SAB 101. Contract revenues and license fees are, in part, dependent upon the achievement of certain research and development and commercialization objectives and, accordingly, may vary from year to year. In the first quarter of 2004, we expect to receive a $10 million payment from Schering AG for the EMEA grant of marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU. 43 Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Cost of sales $ 284,739 $ 1,457 $ Research and development 233,337 100,868 90,458 Selling, general and administrative 174,596 88,021 51,082 Write off of acquired in process research and development 823,000 Amortization of acquired intangibles 33,180 Total operating costs and expenses $ 1,548,852 $ 190,346 $ 141,540 Cost of Sales In 2003, total cost of sales was $284.7 million and consisted of product cost of sales of $283.8 million and cost of royalty revenues of $0.9 million. In November 2003, we recorded the inventory that we acquired from Biogen, Inc. at its estimated fair value. Product cost of sales consisted of $254.3 million related to AVONEX, $18.7 million related to ZEVALIN and $8.7 million related to AMEVIVE. In 2003, included in product cost of sales was approximately $231.6 million in fair market value purchase accounting adjustments related to AVONEX and AMEVIVE. We expect that approximately $304 million in fair market value purchase accounting adjustments related to AVONEX and AMEVIVE will be included in product cost of sales in 2004. The increase to fair market value was recognized as cost of product sales when the acquired inventory was sold or written down. Included in product cost of sales were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration, in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value. In 2003, we wrote down $160.8 million related to AVONEX, $1 million related to AMEVIVE and $12.1 million related to ZEVALIN. AVONEX was written down from fair market value when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications. We have encountered problems in manufacturing our pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX. If these problems continue we are likely to have to incur additional charges and could potentially experience an interruption in the supply of AVONEX. In 2002 cost of sales consisted primarily of contractual royalties owed on ZEVALIN sales. Pre launch production of ZEVALIN antibodies manufactured prior to FDA approval in February 2002 were recognized as research and development expenses. ZEVALIN sales to date have solely consisted of ZEVALIN antibodies produced prior to FDA approval in February 2002. Gross margin on product sales, which includes inventory written down to its net realizable value, was approximately (65)% in 2003. Gross margin on product sales was approximately 89% in 2002. During 2003, we recorded the inventory that we acquired from Biogen, Inc. at its estimated fair value. The increase in fair market value was recognized as cost of product sales when the acquired inventory was sold or written down. As a result, gross margin on product sales decreased significantly from 2002. We expect that gross margins will increase significantly during 2004 as the inventory acquired from Biogen, Inc. at its estimated fair value is sold. Excluding the increase in fair market value related to purchase accounting and the effects of writedowns of commercial inventory to net realizable value, gross margins of product sales would have been 84% in 2003. We expect that gross margins will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product mix, write downs of excess or obsolete inventories and new product initiatives. Gross margin on royalty revenues were approximately 92% in 2003. We expect that gross margins on royalty revenues will fluctuate in the future based changes in sales volumes for specific products from which we receive royalties. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses totaled $233.3 million in 2003 compared to $100.9 million in 2002 and $90.5 million in 2001. The increase in research and development expenses in 2003 over 2002 primarily related to the acquisition of Biogen, Inc. which contributed $63.6 million in research and development 44 Table of Contents expenses for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003, a $20 million payment to Genentech in conjunction with entering into an amended and restated collaboration agreement in June 2003, a $17.6 million increase in personnel expenses resulting from the expansion of our manufacturing and research functions, a $12.8 million increase in contract research and manufacturing expenses primarily related to oncology development and a $22.8 million increase in manufacturing costs recorded as research and development expense. We did not manufacture ZEVALIN bulk inventory in 2003. In 2003, our manufacturing facilities were primarily used to support products in development which caused the majority of the costs of our manufacturing operations to be recorded as research and development expense in 2003. Such costs were capitalized into inventory in 2002 to the extent they related to the manufacture of ZEVALIN. The increase in research and development expenses in 2002 over 2001 was primarily due to upfront fees incurred under new collaborations, one time license fees incurred for technology rights related to our products, increased personnel expenses and expansion of our facilities to support our ongoing basic research and clinical development programs, partially offset by capitalization of manufacturing costs for the production of commercial inventory of ZEVALIN antibodies and decreased clinical testing and development costs for ZEVALIN as a result of the FDAs approval of ZEVALIN. Research and development expenses will increase significantly in 2004 as a result of the merger. We expect to continue incurring additional research and development expenses due to: preclinical and clinical testing of our various products under development; the expansion or addition of research and development programs; technology in licensing; and regulatory related expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $174.6 million in 2003 compared to $88.0 million in 2002 and $51.1 million in 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily related to the acquisition of Biogen, Inc. which contributed $73.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003, including $10.2 million related to restructuring costs associated with the relocation of our European headquarters, a $4.5 million increase in personnel expenses resulting from the expansion in sales and marketing expenses to support the commercialization of ZEVALIN, a $2.5 million increase in legal fees to protect our intellectual property rights, a $2.2 million increase in insurance expenses due to higher premiums, a $1.3 million increase in travel expenses primarily related to integration efforts associated with the merger with Biogen, Inc., and a $1.3 million increase in information technology expenses with the remaining increase due to the expansion of our administrative function to support growth in manufacturing and research. We anticipate that total selling, general, and administrative expense that we record in 2004 will be substantially higher compared to what we recorded in 2003, since we will be reporting the full years worth of selling, general and administrative expenses related to supporting AVONEX and AMEVIVE in 2004 as opposed to only for the period of November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003 in our 2003 results of operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 increased compared to 2001 primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to the commercial launch of ZEVALIN, sales expenses to support the commercialization of RITUXAN, increased legal fees to protect our intellectual property rights for ZEVALIN and increases in general and administrative expenses to support overall organizational growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future to support the following: marketing and administration related to the commercialization of ZEVALIN; manufacturing capacity expansion; clinical trials; research and development; and protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights for ZEVALIN and our product candidates. 45 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Interest income $ 33,610 $ 34,528 $ 38,528 Interest expense (15,182 ) (16,073 ) (7,304 ) Other expense (29,383 ) (809 ) (757 ) Total other income (expense), net $ (10,955 ) $ 17,646 $ 30,467 Interest income totaled $33.6 million in 2003 compared to $34.5 million in 2002 and $38.5 million in 2001. The decrease in interest income in 2003 is primarily due to lower rates of return on securities available for sale. The average yields earned on our investments in 2002 decreased from the average yields earned on our investments in 2001 as a result of declining market interest rates. Interest income levels that may be achieved in the future are, in part, dependent upon market conditions. Interest expense totaled $15.2 million in 2003 compared to $16.1 million in 2002 and $7.3 million in 2001. The decrease in interest expense in 2003 compared to 2002 is due to the capitalization of $6.8 million in 2003 and $0.4 million in 2002 of interest costs largely related to the development of a consolidated west coast research and development and administration campus in San Diego, California and our large scale manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, offset by higher noncash interest expense from our senior notes issued in April and May 2002. Other expenses as set forth in the preceding table included the following: December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Donation to Biogen Idec Foundation $ (10,000 ) $ $ Settlement of patent disputes (20,668 ) Miscellaneous 1,285 (809 ) (757 ) Total other expense $ (29,383 ) $ (809 ) $ (757 ) In October 2002, Biogen, Inc. established The Biogen Foundation, a private, U.S. based, non profit philanthropic organization. In December 2002, Biogen, Inc. made a charitable contribution of $15 million to fund the Biogen Foundation. As a result of the merger, we changed the name of the foundation to The Biogen Idec Foundation and, in December 2003 contributed an additional $10 million. The foundation is to operate exclusively for the benefit of charitable, educational and scientific purposes. Certain executive officers and other employees serve as directors and officers of the foundation. We classify charitable contributions to other income (expense). In December 2003, we recorded charges of $2.5 million and $18.2 million related to the final settlement of patent infringement disputes with Apoxis S.A. and Corixa Corporation, respectively. These payments for settlement of litigation were charged to other expense in the fourth quarter of 2003. Acquired In Process Research and Development In the fourth quarter of 2003, we incurred a charge of $823 million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D, related to the merger with Biogen, Inc. The amount expensed as IPR&D represents the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model. For each project, the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 16%. As of November 12, 2003, we estimated future R&D costs of 46 Table of Contents approximately $106 million, $48 million, and $301 million, respectively, would be incurred to complete the neurology, dermatology, and rheumatology research projects. These estimates are net of any research and development costs that were shared under collaborations with corporate partners. The research projects, which were in various stages of development, from preclinical through stage 3 clinical trials, are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 2004 through 2008. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the risk that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and the risk that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results. Amortization of Intangible Assets In 2003, we recorded amortization expense of $33.2 million related to the intangible assets of $3.7 billion acquired in the merger with Biogen, Inc. Intangible assets consist of $3.0 billion in core technology, $578 million in patents and $64 million in trademarks. Amortization of the core technology is provided over the estimated useful lives of the technology ranging from 15 to 21 years. Amortization of the patents is provided over the remaining lives of the patents of 12 years. Trademarks have an indefinite life and, as such, are not amortized. Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate in 2003 was approximately 1% compared to 36% percent in 2002 and 37% in 2001. Our effective tax rate for 2003 varied substantially from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the pre tax loss resulting from the write off of non deductible IPR&D and other costs in connection with the merger with Biogen, Inc. which was not deductible for income tax purposes. Excluding the effect of our write off of IPR&D, our 2005 effective tax rate would have been approximately 35%. Our effective tax rate for 2002 was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily because of state taxes. We have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income. The utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the Internal Revenue Code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than 50% in prior years. However, we anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. During 2002, we decreased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to zero as, based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Net Income (Loss) In 2003, results of operations provided a net loss of $875.1 million compared to net income of $148.1 million and $101.7 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in net income from 2002 is primarily attributable to the writedown of acquired IPR&D, the recognition of product cost of sales at fair market value on sales of AVONEX and AMEVIVE, and the amortization of intangible assets. Financial Condition We have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through profits and other revenues from our joint business arrangement with Genentech related to the sale of RITUXAN, sales of AVONEX, AMEVIVE and ZEVALIN, sales of equity securities, royalty revenues, corporate partner revenues, lease financing transactions, debt financing transactions and interest income. We expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand, which includes the proceeds from the April 47 Table of Contents and May 2002 issuance of our senior notes, funds from our joint business arrangement with Genentech related to the sale of RITUXAN, funds from commercial sales of AVONEX, AMEVIVE and ZEVALIN, and funds from royalties and funds from existing collaborative agreements and contracts. We believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we may, from time to time, seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. Our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including: the continued commercial success of AVONEX and RITUXAN; the commercial success of AMEVIVE and ZEVALIN; timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals for new products; funding and timing of payments related to several material capital projects, the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing; fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs; levels of resources that we need to devote to the development of manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities, including resources devoted to the marketing of AVONEX, RITUXAN, AMEVIVE, ZEVALIN and future products; technological advances; status of products being developed by competitors; our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations; and working capital required to satisfy the put options related to our senior notes and subordinated notes. Until required for operations, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, foreign and United States government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. Cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale increased to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2003 from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2002, primarily as a result of our acquisition of $965.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale from Biogen, Inc. in the merger. Our operating activities generated $219.2 million of cash for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $179.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net cash from operating activities includes our net loss of $875.1 million, which was offset by noncash charges of $823 million from the write off of IPR&D related to the merger, $173.9 related to the writedown of inventory to net realizable value, a $79.1 million impact on sales of stepped up inventory, and $61.3 million of depreciation and amortization. Our investing activities utilized $278.9 million of cash in 2003 compared to $839.2 million in 2002, and included uses of $301.2 million to fund construction projects and purchase real property and equipment, including our research and development and administration campus in San Diego and manufacturing facility in Oceanside, and $114.6 of net cash used in purchases, sales, and maturities of available for sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities was offset by $136.8 million assumed in the acquisition of Biogen, Inc. Cash generated from financing activities included $24.4 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In April and May 2002, we raised through the issuance of our senior notes, approximately $696 million, net of underwriting commissions and expenses of $18.4 million. Simultaneously with the issuance of the senior notes, we used a portion of the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $135 million of our outstanding common stock. The senior notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of 1.75% annually. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of these senior notes during any nine month period commencing on or after April 30, 2007 if the average market price of the senior notes for a five trading day measurement period preceding such nine month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such senior note. The contingent interest payable per senior note in respect of any quarterly period within such nine month period where contingent interest is determined to be payable will equal the greater of (1) the amount of regular cash dividends paid by us per share on our common stock during that quarterly period multiplied by the then applicable conversion rate or (2) 0.0625% of the average market price of a senior note for the five trading day measurement period preceding such nine month period, provided that if we do not pay regular cash dividends during a semiannual period, we will pay contingent interest semiannually at a rate of 0.125% of the average market price of a senior note for the five trading day measurement period immediately preceding such nine month period. Upon maturity, the senior notes will have an aggregate principal face value of $1.2 billion. Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value senior note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into 7.1881 shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $82.49. In addition, holders of the 48 Table of Contents senior notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the senior notes on April 29, 2005, 2007, 2012 and 2017 at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase, payable at our option in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock. In addition, if a change in control in our company occurs on or before April 29, 2007, holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their senior notes for cash. We have the right to redeem at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption all or a portion of the senior notes for cash at any time on or after April 29, 2007. In February 1999, we raised through the issuance of our subordinated notes, approximately $112.7 million, net of underwriting commissions and expenses of $3.9 million. The subordinated notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of 5.5% annually. Upon maturity, the subordinated notes will have an aggregate principal face value of $345 million. Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value subordinated note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into 40.404 shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $8.36. The holders of the subordinated notes may require us to purchase the subordinated notes on February 16, 2009 or 2014 at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase with us having the option to repay the subordinated notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock. We have the right to redeem at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption all or a portion of the subordinated notes for cash at any time. In September 2001, we purchased approximately 42.6 acres of land in San Diego, California for approximately $31.7 million in cash where we are building a consolidated research and development and administration campus. Construction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 at an estimated total cost of $177 million. As of December 31, 2003, we have invested approximately $58.2 million in the construction of this campus. In September 2000, we purchased a 60 acre site in Oceanside, California for approximately $18.9 million in cash. In December 2002, we purchased an additional 27 acres of land at the Oceanside site for $7.9 million in cash. We are building a large scale manufacturing facility at this location, which we anticipate using to manufacture commercial products currently in clinical trials if they are approved by the FDA. We anticipate the new facility to be mechanically completed in 2005, followed by commissioning and validation targeted for 2006. Total costs of this facility upon completion are estimated to be $400 million. As of December 31, 2003, we have invested approximately $298 million in the construction of this large scale manufacturing facility. In February 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 12 million shares of our common stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with treasury shares of general corporate purposes, such as stock to be issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. To date, we have not repurchased any shares under the program. In May 1999, we entered into an arrangement with MDS (Canada) Inc., MDS Nordion Division, successor to MDS Nordion, Inc., or MDS (Canada), under which MDS agreed to supply us yttrium 90, a radioisotope used in connection with administering ZEVALIN. MDS (Canada) initially supplied product for use in the ZEVALIN clinical trials. In anticipation of commercial launch of ZEVALIN, we subsequently determined that additional commercial production capacity for yttrium 90 would be necessary. To obtain a commitment from MDS (Canada) that sufficient commercial supply would be available, we agreed to minimum purchase commitments of $55 million, and to make periodic cash payments totaling $25 million into an escrow account. The supply agreement was amended in November 2001 to give effect to these mutual commitments. In December 2003, in light of the reduced expectations for ZEVALIN sales levels, we agreed to release the $25 million of escrowed funds to MDS (Canada), and MDS (Canada) agreed to eliminate the minimum purchase commitments from the supply arrangement. MDS (Canada)s obligation to supply yttrium 90 remains in effect. We are amortizing the prepayment over the economic life of the agreement. Biogen, Inc. has a tax qualified defined benefit pension plan which provides benefits to all of its U.S. employees based on compensation credits and interest credits to participants accounts using a cash balance method. Biogen, Inc. also has a supplemental retirement benefit plan which covers a select group of 49 Table of Contents highly compensated U.S. employees. The pension plans are noncontributory with benefit formulas based on employee earnings and credited years of service. Biogen, Inc.s funding policy for its pension plans has been to contribute amounts deductible for federal income tax purposes. Funds contributed to the plans have been invested in fixed income and equity securities. At October 1, 2003, Biogen, Inc. ceased allowing new participants into its pension plans. At November 13, 2003, as a result of the merger, we assumed $36.2 million in pension liability related to these plans. We have requested Internal Revenue Service approval of the termination the defined benefit pension plan. We credited participants cash balance accounts under the defined benefit pension plan in respect of compensation and interest earned through December 31, 2003, no further compensation credits will be made, but interest credits will be made until the defined benefit pension plan is terminated and benefits there under distributed to participants. In December we contributed $10 million into the defined benefit pension plan. We also intend to terminate the supplemental retirement benefit plan as of April 1, 2004. We credited participants accounts under supplemental retirement benefit plan in respect of compensation and interest earned through December 31, 2003. No further compensation credits will be made, but interest credits will be made until the supplemental retirement benefit plan is terminated. As of December 31, 2003 we had a liability of $26.9 million related to these plans. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding contingent milestone payments totaling $138.1 million under our collaboration and license agreements) at December 31, 2003, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 3 4 5 After Years 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In thousands) Non cancelable operating leases $ 161,340 $ 31,713 $ 45,550 $ 35,864 $ 48,213 Other long term obligations 59,728 38,759 20,969 Total contractual cash obligations $ 221,068 $ 70,472 $ 66,519 $ 35,864 $ 48,213 All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We do not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Collaboration and License Agreements In September 2001, we entered into a collaborative development agreement with Mitsubishi Pharma to support clinical development of anti CD80 (anti B7.1) antibody products developed using our Primatized antibody technology. Under the terms of an existing license agreement with Mitsubishi Pharma, entered into in November 1993, Mitsubishi Pharma has an exclusive license in Asia to develop and commercialize anti CD80 (anti B7.1) antibody products. These agreements were terminated in December 2003. As a result of the termination of each of these agreements, we have no continuing financial obligations under any of these agreements. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we recognized revenues from our agreements with Mitsubishi Pharma of $1.5 million, $1.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. In June 2000, we entered into a collaborative research and development agreement with Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Tokyo, to develop and commercialize antibody therapeutics against macrophage migration inhibitory factor, or MIF, for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This agreement was terminated in 2002. During 2002 and 2001, we recognized revenues from our agreement with Taisho of $0.7 million and $4.8 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. 50 Table of Contents In June 1999, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Schering AG aimed at the development and commercialization of ZEVALIN. Under the terms of the agreement, we may receive milestone and research and development support payments totaling up to $47.5 million, subject to the attainment of product development objectives. Schering received exclusive marketing and distribution rights to ZEVALIN outside the U.S., and we will receive royalties on product sales by Schering. Under the terms of a separate supply agreement, we are obligated to meet Scherings clinical and commercial requirements for ZEVALIN. Schering may terminate these agreements for any reason. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we recognized revenues from our agreements with Schering of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $9.5 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. Of the revenue recognized in 2001, $6.0 million is for the attainment of product development objectives and a milestone payment when the European Medicines Evaluation Agency accepted for filing the submission of an application for approval of ZEVALIN in the EU. Additionally, as a result of implementing SAB No. 101, we recognized $3.3 million of revenues in 2001, which was previously recognized as revenue in 1999, prior to the implementation of SAB No. 101. In the first quarter of 2004, we expect to receive a $10 million payment from Schering AG for the EMEA grant of marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU. In December 1995, we entered into a collaborative development agreement and a license agreement with Eisai Co, Ltd., aimed at the development and commercialization of anti CD40L antibodies. Under the terms of these agreements, we may receive milestone payments totaling up to $12.5 million and research and development support payments totaling up to $25.0 million, subject to the attainment of certain product development objectives and satisfaction of other criteria to be agreed upon between us and Eisai. Eisai received exclusive rights in Asia and Europe to develop and market products resulting from the collaboration, and we will receive royalties on product sales by Eisai. Eisai may terminate these agreements based on a reasonable determination that the products do not justify continued product development or marketing. During 2003, we did not recognize any revenues related to this collaboration. During 2002 and 2001, we recognized revenues from our agreements with Eisai of $0.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. In December 1994, we entered into a collaborative development agreement and a license agreement with Seikagaku Corporation, aimed at the development and commercialization of an anti CD23 antibody using primatized antibody technology. During 2003 and 2002, we recognized revenues from our agreement with Seikagaku of $0.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. No revenues were recognized under our agreement with Seikagaku during 2001. Although this agreement was terminated effective January 17, 2004, we have certain continuing obligations that remain under the agreement that we may fulfill in the first half of 2004 and for which we would receive revenue from Seikagaku. Under the above agreements, amounts earned by us and recognized as revenue for contract research and development approximate the research and development expenses incurred under the related agreement. In connection with our research and development efforts, we have also entered into various collaboration arrangements which provide us with rights to develop, produce and market products using certain know how, technology and patent rights maintained by the parties. Terms of the various license agreements may require us to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product development objectives and pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. It is not anticipated that the aggregate of any royalty or milestone obligations under these arrangements will be material to our operations. In September 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a license agreement with Fumapharm, under which Biogen, Inc. obtained exclusive rights to develop and market a second generation fumarate derivative with an immunomodulatory mechanism of action, currently in clinical trials in Europe. Under the terms of this agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution license, excluding Germany, for psoriasis, and a production and exclusive marketing and distribution license for the entire world for MS. We have committed to paying Fumapharm additional amounts upon the completion of certain future research milestones and first and second indication development milestones. If all the milestones were to be achieved, 51 Table of Contents we would be required to pay up to an additional 25 million Swiss francs plus royalties over the life of the agreement. In August 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement with Vetter Pharma Fertigung GmbH & Co. KG for the fill finish of Biogen Idec products. Under the terms of this agreement, Biogen, Inc. paid a partial advance payment to Vetter of 35 million Euros in return for reserving certain capacity at Vetters fill finish facility. Upon signing the agreement in August 2003, Biogen, Inc. paid Vetter $5.7 million (5.25 million Euros), which is included as a prepayment in other current assets as of December 31, 2003. The remaining balance of advance payments will become due and payable by us upon the achievement of certain milestones by Vetter. The next two milestones are expected to be achieved in the first quarter of 2004, at which time we will make payments to Vetter of 10.5 million euros and 3.5 million euros, respectively. Two additional milestones totaling 15.75 million Euros are expected to be achieved in 2005 or 2006. In June 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement with Genentech under which we are collaborating with Genentech on the development of a BR3 (BAFF R) protein therapeutic from Biogen, Inc.s pipeline of early stage product candidates. Under the terms of this agreement, Genentech initially will be responsible for the development costs of the product candidates, until that time, if any, when we exercise our opt in rights (which must be done within a certain timeframe). Prior to exercising our opt in rights, to the extent that we incur any development costs in relation to the programs covered by this agreement, they will be recorded as research and development expenses. The reimbursement by Genentech of these costs will be recorded as contract revenue. We have recorded $0.3 million in contract revenues related to the collaboration for the period of November 13 through December 31, 2003. In December 2002, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement with Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. related to the discovery and development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We apply Sunesis proprietary fragment based drug discovery technology, known as tethering, to generate small molecule leads that target select cytokines in the immune system. Under the terms of this agreement, we purchased 1.25 million shares of preferred stock of Sunesis for $6 million, the fair value of the shares. We have acquired certain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize certain compounds resulting from the collaboration. We account for our investment in Sunesis, which is included in other assets, using the cost method of accounting, subject to periodic review of impairment. We will pay Sunesis a quarterly license maintenance fee of $357,500 during the period commencing on April 1, 2004 through July 1, 2005. Additionally, we have a Credit Facility Agreement with Sunesis under which we are obligated to loan Sunesis up to $4 million. At December 31, 2003, there is $1.6 million of borrowings outstanding. We have committed to paying Sunesis additional amounts upon the completion of certain future research milestones and first and second indication development milestones. If all the milestones were to be achieved, we would be required to pay up to an additional $60.5 million over the life of the agreement. In August 2000, Biogen, Inc. entered into a development and marketing collaboration agreement with Elan Pharma International, Ltd, an affiliate of Elan Corporation, plc to collaborate in the development, manufacture and commercialization of ANTEGREN (natalizumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody. Biogen Idec and Elan are currently developing ANTEGREN as a potential treatment for MS, Crohns disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Under the terms of this agreement, we share costs with Elan for on going development activities. There were no material charges related to this collaboration that were charged to research and development expense during the period from November 13 through December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, Elan owed us $6.3 million, representing development expenses incurred by Biogen, Inc. and Biogen Idec to be reimbursed by Elan. We have committed to paying Elan additional amounts upon the completion of certain future milestones. If all the future milestones were to be achieved, we would be required to pay up to an additional $14 million over the remaining life of the agreement. As part of previous agreements that Biogen, Inc. had with Targeted Genetics Corporation, or Targeted, for gene therapy research and development, we own approximately 12.1 million shares of Targeteds common stock with a fair value of $26.6 million, which is included in investments and other assets. We have no remaining commitments or obligations with Targeted. 52 Table of Contents Legal Matters On September 10, 2001, we filed a lawsuit in the federal district court in the Southern District of California against Corixa Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline (Corixas marketing partner) and the University of Michigan seeking declaratory judgment that ZEVALIN and its use in the treatment of various B cell NHLs does not infringe certain issued U.S. patents licensed to Corixa regarding products and processes relating to radioimmunotherapy, also known as the Kaminski patents, and a further declaration that Corixas patents are invalid. On September 12, 2001, Corixa, Glaxo and the University of Michigan filed a lawsuit in the federal district court in the District of Delaware against us for patent infringement. The lawsuit claims that we infringe the patents that are the subject of our declaratory judgment action against Corixa. The lawsuit seeks damages and to permanently enjoin us from commercializing ZEVALIN. This action has been transferred to San Diego and was consolidated with our lawsuit. On February 27, 2004 the parties entered into a Memorandum of Agreement for Settlement of all outstanding disputes. The terms of the Memorandum include mutual releases and dismissal with prejudice of all claims and counterclaims in the current litigation between the parties, with each party bearing their own costs, expenses and fees. In addition, the parties will enter into worldwide, non exclusive licenses, with a right to sublicense, under the patents in suit for the life of such patents. We will pay $20 million in settlement of all outstanding claims in the litigation upon execution of a definitive settlement and license agreement, which is expected to be concluded by the end of March. In addition, we will pay royalties on U.S. net sales of ZEVALIN and may pay a one time payment in the future subject to the attainment of a certain net sales level of ZEVALIN in the U.S. On May 20, 2003, another patent in the family of Kaminski patents, or the 827 patent, was issued to the University of Michigan. The patent is licensed by the University of Michigan to Corixa. On June 3, 2003, we filed a lawsuit in the federal district court in the Southern District of California against Corixa, Glaxo and the University of Michigan seeking declaratory judgment that ZEVALIN and its use in the treatment of various B cell NHLs does not infringe the 827 patent and a further declaration that the patent is invalid. On December 16, 2003, we filed a Voluntary Notice of Dismissal without Prejudice of this lawsuit based on a covenant by the defendants that they would not sue us for infringement as to any claim of the 827 patent based upon ZEVALIN, or the ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen, as currently approved by the FDA, or for any current or past off label use. The dispute related to the 827 patent is included in the Memorandum agreed to by the parties on February 27, 2004. On February 25, 2003, we filed an additional complaint against Corixa and Glaxo in the federal district court in the Southern District of California. The complaint alleges that Corixas and Glaxos conduct since recommendation by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for approval of BEXXAR constitutes, or will constitute, infringement of a patent owned by us. The complaint seeks available remedies under patent laws, including monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief. All claims and counterclaims related to this lawsuit included in the Memorandum agreed to by the parties on February 27, 2004. On July 15, 2003, Biogen, Inc., along with Genzyme Corporation and Abbott Bioresearch Center, Inc., filed suit against Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, contending that we no longer have any obligation to pay royalties to Columbia on sales of our products under a 1993 License Agreement between us and Columbia related to U.S. Patent Nos. 4,399,216; 4,634,665; and 5,179,017, also referred to as the Original Patents, or under a newly issued patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,455,275, also referred to as the 275 Patent. In our suit, we are seeking a declaratory judgment that we have no obligation to pay any further royalties under the license agreement because the Original Patents have expired and the 275 Patent is invalid and unenforceable; and that Columbia should be permanently enjoined from demanding any further royalties based on the 275 Patent or on any pending continuations, continuations in part, or divisional applications of the Original Patents. Columbia has taken the position that we still owe it royalties under the license agreement on the basis of the 275 Patent which was issued on September 24, 2002, over two years after the expiration of the Original Patents. In the event that we are unsuccessful in the present litigation, we may be liable for damages suffered by Columbia with respect to withheld royalties and such other relief as Columbia may seek and be granted by the Court. As a result of our assessment of the invalidity of the 275 Patent, we determined that it was probable that no additional amounts are payable to Columbia. 53 Table of Contents Along with most other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, Biogen, Inc. was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by each of the County of Suffolk, New York, the County of Westchester, New York, and the County of Rockland, New York. All three cases are pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaints allege that the defendants overstated the Average Wholesale Price for drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement, also referred to as Covered Drugs, marketed and promoted the sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the providers ability to collect inflated payments from the government and Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for competing drugs, provided financing incentives to providers to over prescribe Covered Drugs or to prescribe Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs, and overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered Drugs reimbursements. The complaints further allege that the defendants failed to accurately report the best price on the Covered Drugs to New Yorks Medicaid program. Under Medicaid, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies agree to pay Medicaid programs a rebate for each product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate is often the difference between the average manufacturers price and the best price reported by companies to the Medicaid program. Plaintiffs claim that they were harmed because they could have allotted the dollars that they wrongfully spent on Medicaid to other public needs. Plaintiffs have brought the actions under the Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, unfair trade practices, Medicaid fraud, common law fraud, and violation of each of the federal Medicaid Statute, the New York Social Services Law and the New York Department of Health Regulations. In September 2003, Biogen, Inc. joined other named defendants in filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Suffolk County Complaint. In December 2003, the plaintiffs withdrew the RICO claims from the Suffolk County case. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against all of the allegations and claims in these lawsuits. As a result, an estimate of any potential loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. On June 25, 2003, prior to the effective date of the merger, a suit was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, on behalf of a purported class of Biogen, Inc. stockholders against Biogen, Inc., IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and certain members of Biogen, Inc.s board of directors alleging, among other things, that the members of Biogen, Inc.s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties of candor, loyalty, due care, independence, good faith and fair dealing by allegedly tailoring the structural terms of the merger to meet the specific needs of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation rather than attempting to obtain the highest price reasonably available for Biogen, Inc. An agreement in principal to resolve the suit has been reached based upon the disclosure of certain additional information in the joint proxy statement/ prospectus in the registration statement on Form S 4 filed by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation in connection with the merger and the payment of attorneys fees in an amount to be determined by the court. We do not expect the settlement and related attorney fees to be material. In addition, we are involved in certain other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal business activities. While the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and bad debts, marketable securities, inventories, income taxes, impairment for intangible assets and goodwill, research and development, pensions, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 54 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 or SAB 101, superceded in part by SAB 104, provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. SAB 101 establishes the SECs view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured, and requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized. We believe that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 101. Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer. Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns, rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances. The timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings. We prepare our estimates for sales returns and allowances, discounts and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. If actual future results vary, we may need to adjust our estimates, which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment. In the past, our estimates based on historical experience have not materially differed from actual results. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business arrangement consist of our share of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with Genentech, reimbursement from Genentech of our RITUXAN related sales force and development expenses and royalties which are paid to Genentech for sales of rituximab outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Under the copromotion arrangement, all U.S. sales of RITUXAN and associated costs and expenses are recognized by Genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis, as defined in our collaborative agreement with Genentech. Pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking U.S. net sales of RITUXAN to third party customers less cost of sales, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. Our profit sharing formula with Genentech has two tiers; we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met. The profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier. We record our royalty revenue with a one quarter lag. In February 2002, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force or EITF released EITF Issue No. 01 09 or EITF 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products). EITF 01 09 states that cash consideration (including a sales incentive) given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendors products or services and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendors income statement, rather than a sales and marketing expense. We have various contracts with distributors that provide for discounts and rebates. These contracts are classified as a reduction of revenue. We also maintain select customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel. In accordance with EITF 01 09, we have established the fair value of these contracts and, as provided by EITF 01 09, classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense. If we had concluded that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for these contracts, we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue. We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which the we have rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us (adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate). We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees. There are 55 Table of Contents no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements. Under this policy, revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution of royalty disputes and arbitration. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required, which could affect future earnings. Biogen, Inc. Purchase Price Allocation The purchase price related to the merger with Biogen, Inc. was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date. An independent third party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of in process research and development, identifiable intangible assets, inventory and certain property, plant and equipment, and in determining the useful lives of such tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects, determining the product life and term of estimated future cash flows, and developing appropriate costs, expenses, depreciation and amortization assumptions, tax rates, discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions. These assumptions are based on the best available information that we had at the time. Additionally, certain estimates for the purchase price allocation including inventory and taxes may change as subsequent information becomes available. Marketable Securities As part of our strategic product development efforts, we invest in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards or SFAS No. 115 or SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, addresses the accounting for investment in marketable equity securities. As a matter of policy, we determine on a quarterly basis whether any decline in the fair value of a marketable security is temporary or other than temporary. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity, net of related tax effects. If a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is determined to be other than temporary, such marketable security is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings. The factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security, the duration of the securitys decline, prospects for the company, including favorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements. Any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings. In connection with our assessment at December 31, 2003, $2.7 million of unrealized losses related to these marketable securities were determined to be temporary. The fair market value of these marketable securities totaled $27.1 million at December 31, 2003. We also invest in equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and fair value is not readily available. These investments are recorded using the cost method of accounting and, as a matter of policy, we monitor these investments in private securities on a quarterly basis, and determine whether any impairment in their value would require a charge to current earnings, based on the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee, market prices of comparable public companies, and general market conditions. At December 31, 2003, we included approximately $25.3 million of investments in private securities in other assets. There were no charges to current earnings in 2003, 2002, or 2001 for impairments of these investments. Recognition of impairments for these securities may cause variability in earnings. 56 Table of Contents Inventory Capitalization Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. We capitalize inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval, based on managements judgment of probable future commercialization. We could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies. We recognized ZEVALIN antibodies manufactured prior to FDA approval in February 2002 as research and development expenses. We write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us, additional inventory write downs may be required. We wrote down $173.9 million of unmarketable inventory during 2003, which was charged to cost of product revenues and consisted of $160.8 million related to AVONEX, $1 million related to AMEVIVE and $12.1 million related to ZEVALIN. AVONEX was written down to net realizable value when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications. Included in the AVONEX writedown was $149.6 million in fair market value adjustments related to purchase accounting. ZEVALIN was written down to net realizable value due to product expiration. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes a provision for income tax contingencies which we believe is adequate and appropriate. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Our estimates of future taxable income are derived from, among other items, our estimates of future deductions related to stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development costs, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators, are expensed as incurred. The timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense. Clinical trial costs include costs associated with contract research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of management fees, site management and site monitoring costs, and data management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial costs and estimated clinical trial costs have not been material and are adjusted for in the period which they become known. Under this policy, research and development expense can vary due to accrual adjustments related to clinical trials. 57 Table of Contents Contingencies and Litigation There has been, and we expect there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices, regulatory issues, pricing, and patents and other intellectual property rights. Certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future, including in the litigation described under Legal Matters, could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Standards In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. Variable interest entities that effectively disperse risk will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed. FIN 46 also requires enhanced disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after March 15, 2004 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The adoption of SFAS 149 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. This Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after December 15, 2004. The adoption of SFAS150 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. In June 2003, the EITF issued EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 establishes an approach to be used in determining when a revenue arrangement that involves multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, if separation of an arrangement is appropriate, how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units. This Statement is effective for arrangements entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00 21 did not have a material effect on our financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The revised SFAS 132 retains all of the disclosure requirements of the original SFAS 132 and amends APB Opinion No. 28 Interim Financial Reporting, to require interim period disclosure of the components of net periodic pension cost, and if significantly different from previously disclosed amounts, the amounts of contributions and projected contributions to fund pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. This Statement is effective for interim period disclosures beginning after December 15, 2003. We have complied with the disclosure provision of SFAS 132. On December 17, 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Staff) issued SAB 104, Revenue Recognition, which amends SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple 58 Table of Contents element revenue arrangements, superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00 21. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the SECs Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (the FAQ) issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. Selected portions of the FAQ have been incorporated into SAB 104. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF 00 21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. EITF 03 01, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments was issued in February 2004. EITF 03 01 stipulates disclosure requirements for investments with unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. The provisions of EITF 03 01 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. We have complied with the disclosure provisions of EITF 03 01. Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures We use a pro forma gross margin of product sales measure in the Cost of Sales section and a pro forma effective tax rate measure in the Income Tax Provision section. These are non GAAP financial measures. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of each non GAAP financial measure as well as the reconciliation between each non GAAP financial measure and the GAAP financial measure are presented in the discussions of the non GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors. In particular, management believes that the non GAAP financial measures allow investors to monitor and evaluate our ongoing operating results and trends and gain a better understanding of our past performance as well as period to period performance. 59 Table of Contents Item 7A.
