Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K, beginning on page F 1. Overview Biogen Idec creates new standards of care in oncology and immunology. As a global leader in the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of novel therapies, we transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare. We currently have five products: AVONEX (interferon beta 1a) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, or MS. RITUXAN (rituximab) and ZEVALIN(ibritumomab tiuxetan), both of which treat certain B cell non Hodgkins lymphomas, or B cell NHLs. We collaborate with Genentech Inc., or Genentech, on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN. RITUXAN is the trade name in the United States, or U.S., Canada and Japan for the compound rituximab. MabThera is the tradename for rituximab in the European Union, or EU. In this Form 10 K, we refer to rituximab, RITUXAN and MabThera collectively as RITUXAN, except where we have otherwise indicated. TYSABRI (natalizumab), formerly known as ANTEGREN, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in November 2004 to treat relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan Corporation plc, or Elan, voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. In addition, we suspended dosing in clinical studies of TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease and rheumatoid arthritis, or RA. These decisions were based on reports of two serious adverse events that have occurred in patients treated with TYSABRI in combination with AVONEX in MS clinical studies. These events involved two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Both patients received more than two years of TYSABRI in combination with AVONEX. In light of the two reports of PML, the companies initiated a systematic review of the TYSABRI safety database. On March 30, 2005, we and Elan announced that the review of the safety database led a serious adverse event previously reported by a clinical investigator in a clinical study of TYSABRI in Crohns disease to be reassessed as PML. The case was originally reported by the investigator as malignant astrocytoma in July 2003. The patient died in December 2003. The patient had received 8 doses of TYSABRI over an 18 month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents. We and Elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML. The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re initiation of dosing in clinical studies and future commercial availability. See Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. AMEVIVE (alefacept) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. We also receive royalty revenues on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control, including on sales by Schering AG of ZEVALIN in the EU. In addition, we have a number of ongoing research and development programs in our core therapeutic areas and in other areas of interest. Merger On November 12, 2003, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Biogen, Inc. completed a merger transaction, or the Merger, resulting in Biogen, Inc. becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The business combination was treated as an acquisition of Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation for accounting purposes. In connection with the Merger, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation changed its name to Biogen Idec Inc. 44 Table of Contents As a result of the Merger, Biogen, Inc. stockholders received 1.15 shares of Biogen Idec common stock for each share of Biogen, Inc. common stock. As a result, Biogen Idec issued approximately 171.9 million shares of common stock at a fair value of approximately $6.48 billion (based on the average of the closing price of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporations common stock for the period from two days before through two days after the public announcement of the Merger on June 23, 2003). In addition, options to purchase Biogen, Inc. common stock outstanding at November 12, 2003 were assumed by Biogen Idec and converted into options to purchase approximately 20.7 million shares of Biogen Idec common stock at a fair value of approximately $295 million (based on the Black Scholes option pricing model, as described in more detail below). We paid approximately $19.9 million in fees for banking, legal, accounting and tax related services related to the Merger. Merger related fees of $21.5 million paid by Biogen, Inc. prior to completion of the Merger are not included in this amount as they were expensed as incurred. The total Merger purchase price was approximately $6.8 billion. The Merger qualified as a tax free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The fair value of Biogen Idecs shares used in determining the purchase price was $37.69 per share based on the average of the closing price of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporations common stock for the period two days before through two days after public announcement of the Merger on June 23, 2003. The fair value of stock options assumed by Biogen Idec in the Merger was determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: stock price of $37.69, which is the value ascribed to IDEC shares in determining the purchase price; volatility of 40%; risk free interest rate of 1.8%; and an expected life of 4.0 years. The purchase price is as follows (table in thousands): Fair value of Biogen Idec common stock $ 6,480,339 Fair value of replacement stock options 295,399 Cash paid for fractional shares 27 Acquisition related costs 19,872 Total purchase price $ 6,795,637 The purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their fair values as of November 12, 2003, the date that the Merger was consummated (table in thousands): Inventory $ 706,957 Accounts receivable 216,221 Property, plant and equipment 713,719 Acquired identifiable intangible assets 3,664,000 Goodwill 1,151,105 In process research and development 823,000 Deferred stock based compensation 2,261 Other current and long term assets 1,106,112 Assumed liabilities (424,648 ) Increase benefit plan liability to fair value (26,650 ) Deferred tax liabilities arising from fair value adjustments (1,136,440 ) Total purchase price $ 6,795,637 The allocation of the purchase price was based, in part, on a third party valuation of the fair value of in process research and development, identifiable intangible assets, and certain property, plant and equipment. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is allocated to goodwill. See Biogen, Inc. Purchase Price Allocation under Critical Accounting Estimates. 45 Table of Contents The discussions for the year ended December 31, 2004 in this Form 10 K represent our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and include the results of operations of the merged companies. The discussions for the year ended December 31, 2003 in this Form 10 K, unless indicated otherwise, represent our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and include the results of operations of Biogen, Inc. for the period commencing November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003 only. The results of operations of Biogen, Inc. (revenues and expenses) for the period commencing January 1, 2003 through November 12, 2003, unless indicated otherwise, are excluded from this Form 10 K. Comparisons are made to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, which only include the historical results of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Results of Operations Revenues 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Product sales United States $ 986,050 $ 121,589 $ 13,711 Rest of world 500,294 49,972 Total product sales 1,486,344 171,561 13,711 Revenues from unconsolidated joint business 615,743 493,049 385,809 Royalties 98,945 12,010 Corporate partner revenue 10,530 2,563 4,702 Total revenues $ 2,211,562 $ 679,183 $ 404,222 Product Sales 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) AVONEX $ 1,417,157 $ 142,603 $ AMEVIVE 43,030 9,356 ZEVALIN 23,036 19,602 13,711 TYSABRI 3,121 Total product sales $ 1,486,344 $ 171,561 $ 13,711 AVONEX is the most prescribed therapeutic product in MS worldwide. Globally over 130,000 patients have chosen AVONEX as their treatment of choice. During 2004, sales of AVONEX generated worldwide revenues of $1.4 billion, of which $922.6 million was generated in the U.S. and $494.6 million was generated outside the U.S., primarily in the EU. Product sales from AVONEX represent approximately 64% of our total revenues in 2004. Our results of operations for 2003 include sales of AVONEX for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. During that period, sales of AVONEX generated worldwide revenues of $142.6 million, of which $92.6 million was generated in the U.S. and $50.0 million in the rest of the world, primarily the EU. Product sales from AVONEX represented approximately 21% of our total revenues in 2003. We expect to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace in and outside the U.S. from existing and new MS treatments, including TYSABRI if it is reintroduced to the market, that may impact sales of AVONEX. We expect future growth in AVONEX revenues to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully. AMEVIVE was approved in the U.S. in 2003 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. During 2004, sales of AMEVIVE generated revenues of $43.0 million, substantially all in the U.S. Our results of operations for 2003 include sales of AMEVIVE for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. During 46 Table of Contents that period, sales of AMEVIVE generated revenues of $9.4 million, substantially all in the U.S. Product sales from AMEVIVE represent approximately 2% and 1% of our total revenues in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In February 2002, ZEVALIN became the first radioimmunotherapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain B cell NHLs. ZEVALIN, as part of the ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen, is approved as a treatment for relapsed or refractory low grade, follicular, or transformed B cell NHL including patients with RITUXAN refractory follicular NHL. We launched ZEVALIN in the U.S. in April 2002. In 2004, sales of ZEVALIN generated revenues of $18.7 million in the U.S. as compared to $19.6 million in 2003. Outside the U.S., we have licensed our marketing rights in ZEVALIN to Schering AG. In January 2004, the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, the regulatory authority in the EU, granted marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with CD20+ follicular B cell NHL who are refractory to or have relapsed following treatment with RITUXAN. Rest of world product sales for ZEVALIN for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $4.3 million. The $4.3 million relates to ZEVALIN sold to Schering AG in 2003 and 2004, recognition of which had been deferred. The revenue was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2004 when an amendment to the license agreement was executed and the price of ZEVALIN became determinable. Product sales from ZEVALIN represented approximately 1% and 3% of our total revenues in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In November 2004, TYSABRI was approved by the FDA as treatment for relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. In the U.S., prior to the suspension, we sold TYSABRI to Elan who then distributed TYSABRI to third party distributors and other customers. In 2004, our revenue associated with sales of TYSABRI was $3.1 million, which represents less than 1% of our total revenues in 2004. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. The voluntary suspension will not affect 2004 revenue. We and Elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML. The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine the possibility of re initiation of dosing in clinical studies and future commercial availability. See also Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable under Critical Accounting Estimates for our method of recording revenue from TYSABRI sales. See also the risks affecting revenues described in Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Our Revenues Rely Significantly on a Limited Number of Products and Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenue RITUXAN is currently marketed and sold worldwide for the treatment of certain B cell NHLs. We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with Genentech under a collaboration agreement between the parties. Under the collaboration agreement, we granted Genentech a worldwide license to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in multiple indications. In exchange for these worldwide rights, we have copromotion rights in the U.S. and a contractual arrangement under which Genentech shares a portion of the pretax U.S. copromotion profits of RITUXAN with us. This collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement not through a joint venture or other legal entity. In June 2003, we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with Genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti CD20 antibodies targeting B cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of indications. In the U.S., we contribute resources to selling and the continued development of RITUXAN. Genentech is responsible for worldwide manufacturing of RITUXAN. Genentech also is responsible for the primary support functions for the commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. including selling and marketing, customer service, order entry, distribution, shipping and billing. Genentech also incurs the majority of 47 Table of Contents continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Under the arrangement, we have a limited sales force as well as limited development activity. Under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between Genentech and Roche, commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where Roche copromotes RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku. There is no direct contractual arrangement between Biogen Idec and Roche or Zenyaku. Revenue from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of pretax copromotion profits which is calculated by Genentech, and includes consideration of our RITUXAN related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenue from sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Copromotion profit consists of U.S. sales of RITUXAN to third party customers net of discounts and allowances and less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses, and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula has two tiers. We earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met. The profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier. We began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the first quarter of 2004, 2003 and 2002. Upon approval of the first new anti CD20 product, the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and other anti CD20 products sold by us and Genentech will change over a period of time to a fixed annual profit sharing percentage at the lower tier. Copromotion profits for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, consist of the following (table in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 Product revenues, net $ 1,573,228 $ 1,360,537 $ 1,080,240 Costs and expenses 418,190 299,398 256,496 Copromotion profits $ 1,155,038 $ 1,061,139 $ 823,744 Biogen Idecs share of copromotion profits $ 457,025 $ 419,197 $ 324,498 Net sales of RITUXAN to third party customers in the U.S. recorded by Genentech for 2004 were $1.6 billion compared to $1.4 billion in 2003 and $1.1 billion in 2002. The increase in 2004 from 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of B cell NHLs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and increases in the wholesale price of RITUXAN effective September 2004, March 2003 and March 2002. We received royalties on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. of $121.0 million in 2004 as compared to $67.9 million in 2003 and $45.4 million in 2002, which we include under Revenue from unconsolidated joint business in our consolidated statements of income. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, consist of the following (table in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 Copromotion profits $ 457,025 $ 419,197 $ 324,498 Reimbursement of selling and development expenses 37,710 18,400 15,879 Royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. 121,008 67,869 45,432 RITUXAN clinical data purchased from Roche (9,353 ) Columbia patent royalty and interest payment (3,064 ) $ 615,743 $ 493,049 $ 385,809 48 Table of Contents Our royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is based on Roche and Zenyakus net sales to third party customers and is recorded on a cash basis. The increase in royalty revenues in 2004 and 2003 is due to increased sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of new anti CD20 products and will only receive such royalty revenues for the first eleven years from the date of first commercial sale of such new anti CD20 products. During 2003, Genentech purchased certain clinical data from Roche that supported a potential label expansion of RITUXAN. Additionally, in 2003, we, along with Genentech, agreed that payments were owed to Columbia University for royalties related to past sales of RITUXAN in the U.S. As a result, we recognized $2.6 million in royalty payments and $0.5 million in interest charges related to these royalties. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business represented 28%, 73% and 95% of our total revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decreases in 2004 and 2003 are primarily due to former Biogen, Inc. revenue included in our results of operations for all of 2004 and for the period of November 12, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Royalty Revenue We receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control. During 2004 and 2003, we received approximately $98.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in royalty revenues representing 4% and 2% of total revenues. The increase in royalty revenue is primarily due to a full year of the former Biogen, Inc. royalty revenue being included in our results of operations in 2004 compared to the period from November 12, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Our royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. are included in Revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We receive royalties from Schering Plough Corporation, or Schering Plough, on sales of its alpha interferon products in the U.S. and Italy under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon patents and patent applications. Schering Plough sells its INTRON A (interferon alfa 2b) brand of alpha interferon in the U.S. for a number of indications, including the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Schering Plough also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of hepatitis C, including REBETRON Combination Therapy containing INTRON A and REBETOL (ribavirin, USP), PEG INTRON (peginterferon alfa 2b), a pegylated form of alpha interferon, and PEG INTRON in combination with REBETOL. We hold several important patents related to hepatitis B antigens produced by genetic engineering techniques. These antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis B infection. We receive royalties from sales of hepatitis B vaccines in several countries, including the U.S., from GlaxoSmithKline plc and Merck and Co. Inc. We have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis B rights, on an antigen by antigen and nonexclusive basis, to several diagnostic kit manufacturers, including Abbott Laboratories, the major worldwide marketer of hepatitis B diagnostic kits. We also receive ongoing royalties on sales of ANGIOMAX (bivalirudin) by The Medicines Company, or TMC. TMC sells ANGIOMAX in the U.S. for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. TMC sells ANGIOMAX through distributors in Europe, Canada and Latin America. We anticipate that total royalty revenues in 2005 will be slightly higher as compared to our total royalty revenues in 2004. Royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs. Corporate Partner Revenues Corporate partner revenues consist of contract revenues and license fees. Corporate partner revenues totaled $10.5 million in 2004 compared to $2.6 million in 2003 and $4.7 million in 2002. Corporate partner 49 Table of Contents revenues represented less than 1% of total revenues in 2004 and 2003 and approximately 1% of total revenues in 2002. In 2004, we received a $10.0 million payment from Schering AG for the EMEA grant of marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU. The payment represented, in part, a milestone payment to compensate us for preparing, generating, and collecting data that was critical to the EMEA marketing approval process and, to which we have no continuing involvement. The decrease in corporate partner revenues in 2003 is primarily due to decreased research and development funding in 2002 under our collaborations with Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Tokyo, or Taisho, as a result of the termination of our collaboration with Taisho, and under our collaborations with Seikagaku Corporation, or Seikagaku. Contract revenues and license fees are, in part, dependent upon the achievement of certain research and development and commercialization objectives and, accordingly, may vary from year to year. Operating Costs and Expenses 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Cost of product and royalty revenues $ 554,319 $ 284,739 $ 1,457 Research and development 687,663 233,337 100,868 Selling, general and administrative 578,487 174,596 88,021 Write off of acquired in process research and development 823,000 Amortization of acquired intangibles 347,677 33,180 Total operating costs and expenses $ 2,168,146 $ 1,548,852 $ 190,346 Cost of Product and Royalty Revenues In 2004, total cost of product and royalty revenues was $554.3 million and consisted of product cost of revenues of $548.7 million and cost of royalty revenues of $5.6 million. Product cost of revenues consisted of $480.0 million related to AVONEX, $27.8 million related to AMEVIVE, $19.0 million related to ZEVALIN and $17.3 million related to TYSABRI. Approximately $295.1 million in cost of product revenues represents the difference between the cost of AVONEX and AMEVIVE inventory recorded at the Merger date and its historical manufacturing cost, which was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down in 2004. All AVONEX inventory acquired in the Merger was sold or written off as of December 31, 2004. We expect that product cost of revenues in 2005 related to AMEVIVE will include approximately $16 million related to the difference between the cost of AMEVIVE inventory recorded at the Merger and its historical manufacturing cost, as the acquired inventory is sold or written down. In February 2005, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI based on reports of two serious adverse events that occurred in patients treated with TYSABRI in combination with AVONEX in MS clinical studies. These events involved two cases, of PML, a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. In light of the two reports of PML, the companies initiated a systematic review of the TYSABRI safety database. On March 30, 2005, we and Elan announced that the review of the safety database led a serious adverse event previously reported by a clinical investigator in a clinical study of TYSABRI in Crohns disease to be reassessed as PML. The case was originally reported by the investigator as malignant astrocytoma in July 2003. The patient died in December 2003. The patient had received 8 doses of TYSABRI over an 18 month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents. We and Elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML. The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine future commercial availability. We cannot predict the outcome of these evaluations. An unfavorable or inconclusive outcome could result in the permanent withdrawal of TYSABRI from the market and termination of clinical studies of TYSABRI, or the re introduction of TYSABRI to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses, blackbox or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions, requirements and limitations as the FDA may require. While we presently believe that we will be able to find a path forward for TYSABRI, there are no assurances as to the likelihood of success. In 50 Table of Contents light of our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that our TYSABRI inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we have written down all of the $19.1 million of TYSABRI inventory that had been included on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2004, which was charged to cost of product revenues. We are continuing to manufacture TYSABRI. Because of the uncertainty described above, in the first quarter of 2005, we also expect to expense between $22 million to $25 million of TYSABRI that was manufactured in the first quarter of 2005. In subsequent periods, we will continue to assess TYSABRI to determine if it needs to be expensed in light of existing information related to the potential future commercial availability of TYSABRI and applicable accounting standards. See Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect Our Growth. We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write offs may be required. This periodic review led to the write downs of TYSABRI inventory as of December 31, 2004 and the expensing of TYSABRI expected to occur in the first quarter of 2005, as described above, and may lead us to expense TYSABRI in subsequent periods. Also included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration, in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value. In 2004, we wrote down $16.2 million, $9.7 million, $1.7 million and $19.1 million of unmarketable inventory related to AVONEX, ZEVALIN, AMEVIVE and TYSABRI, respectively, which was charged to cost of product revenues. The AVONEX and AMEVIVE inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications. The ZEVALIN inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications and when it was determined to not be marketable based on estimates of demand. In 2003, total cost of revenues was $284.7 million and consisted of product cost of revenues of $283.8 million and cost of royalty revenues of $0.9 million. In November 2003, we recorded the inventory that we acquired from Biogen, Inc. at its estimated fair value. Product cost of revenues consisted of $254.3 million related to AVONEX, $18.7 million related to ZEVALIN and $8.7 million related to AMEVIVE. In 2003, included in product cost of revenues was approximately $231.6 million in fair market value purchase accounting adjustments related to AVONEX and AMEVIVE, which represents the difference between the cost of inventory recorded at the acquisition date and its historical manufacturing cost. The increase to fair market value was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down. Included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration. In all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value. In 2003, we wrote down $160.8 million related to AVONEX, $1.0 million related to AMEVIVE and $12.1 million related to ZEVALIN. Of the $160.8 million write down related to AVONEX, $149.6 million represented the increase to fair market value of inventory acquired at the Merger and $11.2 million represented the historical manufacturing costs. The AVONEX inventory that was written down had been assessed as commercially viable and saleable and there were no known contingent issues at the acquisition date. This inventory was recorded at the estimated selling price less the costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable distribution profit allowance. Our products are required to meet numerous stringent quality specifications that are agreed upon with the FDA at various times prior to and after approval. Based on quality testing performed subsequent to the Merger date, we became aware of certain lots of our pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX that previously had been approved for sale, but after additional testing no longer met the established quality specifications. Substantially all of the AVONEX inventory write down was related to our pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX, in which certain lots had aggregate levels that exceeded the approved specifications. As a result of extensive discussions with the FDA, a new set of testing protocols were agreed to and certain lots were deemed unmarketable. Upon managements determination that the inventory was unmarketable, we wrote off the carrying value of the inventory in the fourth quarter of 2003 because the cost of the inventory would not be recoverable. In 2004, we developed a new pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX, 51 Table of Contents which was approved by the EMEA in November 2004 and the FDA in March 2005. We do not expect to experience interruption in the supply of AVONEX. However, we expect to write down between $6 million and $8 million of the remaining supplies of the older formulation in the first quarter of 2005, related to the FDA approval. Non GAAP gross margin on product revenues, which includes inventory written down to its net realizable value, was approximately 63% and (65)% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The large fluctuation of gross margin on product revenues is due primarily to inventory acquired from Biogen, Inc. through the Merger. During 2003, we recorded the inventory that we acquired from Biogen, Inc. at its estimated fair value. The increase in fair market value was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down. During the first half of 2004, we sold or wrote down all remaining AVONEX inventory acquired through the Merger. As a result, we expect that gross margins will increase during 2005. Excluding the increase in fair market value related to purchase accounting and the effects of write downs of commercial inventory to net realizable value, gross margins of product revenues would have been 86% and 84% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. We expect that gross margins will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product mix, write downs of excess or obsolete inventories and new product initiatives. Gross margin on royalty revenues were approximately 94% and 92% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. We expect that gross margins on royalty revenues will fluctuate in the future based on changes in sales volumes for specific products from which we receive royalties. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses totaled $687.7 million in 2004 compared to $233.3 million in 2003 and $100.9 million in 2002. The increase in research and development expenses in 2004 over 2003 primarily related to a full year of the former Biogen, Inc. expenses in 2004 compared to the period from November 12, 2003 through December 31, 2003. The increase related to the former Biogen, Inc. was $432.8 million and consisted primarily of $74.3 million of expenses related to pre clinical research activities, $144.0 million of development research activities, including clinical trials, related to TYSABRI and AMEVIVE, $84.2 million of biopharmaceutical operations expenses mainly attributable to manufacturing and supply chain functions, $96.1 million of increased depreciation and infrastructure costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing and research facilities, and $17.5 million for our joint development collaboration agreements. The increase in research and development expenses in 2003 over 2002 primarily related to the acquisition of Biogen, Inc. which contributed $63.6 million in research and development expenses for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003, a $20 million payment to Genentech in conjunction with entering into an amended and restated collaboration agreement in June 2003, a $17.6 million increase in personnel expenses resulting from the expansion of our manufacturing and research functions, a $12.8 million increase in contract research and manufacturing expenses primarily related to oncology development and a $22.8 million increase in manufacturing expenses recorded as research and development. Research and development expenses are expected to increase in 2005. We expect to continue incurring additional research and development expenses due to: work with clinical investigators and neurological experts related to our evaluations of TYSABRI resulting from the suspension of TYSABRI from the market in February 2005; preclinical and clinical testing of our various products under development; the expansion or addition of research and development programs and facilities; technology in licensing; and regulatory related expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $578.5 million in 2004 compared to $174.6 million in 2003 and $88.0 million in 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily related to a full year of the former Biogen, Inc. expenses in 2004 compared to the period from November 12, 2003 through December 31, 2003. The increase related to the former Biogen, Inc. was $410.1 million and consisted primarily of $192.9 million of expenses related to neurology and dermatology sales and marketing activities, primarily due to the launch of TYSABRI, $112.9 million of 52 Table of Contents expenses related to our international selling, general and administrative initiatives, $64.2 million of expenses related to our finance and information technology infrastructure, and $34.6 million of expenses related to the expansion of our global medical affairs Phase IV initiatives. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily related to the acquisition of Biogen, Inc. which contributed $73.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003, including $10.2 million related to restructuring costs associated with the relocation of our European headquarters, a $4.5 million increase in personnel expenses resulting from the expansion in sales and marketing expenses to support the commercialization of ZEVALIN, a $2.5 million increase in legal fees to protect our intellectual property rights, a $2.2 million increase in insurance expenses due to higher premiums, a $1.3 million increase in travel expenses primarily related to integration efforts associated with the Merger with Biogen, Inc., and a $1.3 million increase in information technology expenses with the remaining increase due to the expansion of our administrative function to support growth in manufacturing and research. In 2004, we recorded charges of $4.4 million related to severance obligations for certain employees affected by the Merger in our San Diego facilities. At December 31, 2004, we had a remaining accrual of approximately $0.4 million related to the San Diego severance obligations. In 2004, we accrued approximately $2.3 million of restructuring costs related to the relocation of our European headquarters. Our remaining liability related to these European headquarters restructuring costs was $1.1 million at December 31, 2004. In 2003, we accrued $2.1 million of restructuring costs related to severance obligations for certain employees affected by the Merger in our Cambridge facilities, and accrued an additional $1.0 million of charges in 2004. At December 31, 2004, our remaining liability related to the Cambridge severance obligations was $0.2 million. We anticipate that total selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2005 will be higher than 2004 due to sales and marketing and other general and administrative expenses to primarily support AVONEX and TYSABRI, despite the voluntary suspension of the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI in February 2005, and legal expenses related to lawsuits, investigations and other matters resulting from the suspension of TYSABRI. Other Income (Expense), Net December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Interest income $ 57,225 $ 33,610 $ 34,528 Interest expense (18,898 ) (15,182 ) (16,073 ) Other expense (17,650 ) (29,383 ) (809 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 20,677 $ (10,955 ) $ 17,646 Interest income totaled $57.2 million in 2004 compared to $33.6 million in 2003 and $34.5 million in 2002. The increase in interest income in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily due to higher cash levels and higher yields on our marketable securities portfolio. The decrease in interest income in 2003 as compared to 2002 is primarily due to lower rates of return on marketable securities available for sale on our investments. Interest income levels that may be achieved in the future are, in part, dependent upon market conditions. Interest expense totaled $18.9 million in 2004 compared to $15.2 million in 2003 and $16.1 million in 2002. The increase in interest expense in 2004 compared to 2003 related to an updated estimation of the life of the senior notes due in 2032, which we expect holders will require us to repurchase in April 2005. As a result, amortization of the issuance costs related to the senior notes increased $7.1 million. This was offset by lower noncash interest expense due to conversions throughout 2004 of our subordinated notes issued in February 1999, and higher capitalized interest expense in 2004. The decrease in interest expense in 2003 compared to 2002 is due to the capitalization of $6.8 million in 2003 and $0.4 million in 2002 of interest costs largely related to the development of a consolidated west coast research and development and administration campus 53 Table of Contents in San Diego, California and our large scale manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, offset by higher noncash interest expense from our senior notes. Other expense as set forth in the preceding table included the following (table in thousands): December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Impairments of marketable securities $ (18,482 ) $ $ Foreign exchange remeasurement gains 5,353 1,319 Loss on sale of marketable securities available for sale (4,090 ) Gain on investments in executive deferred compensation plan 1,029 Donation to Biogen Idec Foundation (10,000 ) Settlement of patent disputes (20,668 ) Miscellaneous (1,460 ) (34 ) (809 ) Total other expense $ (17,650 ) $ (29,383 ) $ (809 ) In 2004, we recorded charges totaling $18.5 million to other expense when it was determined that certain marketable securities were impaired on an other than temporary basis. In October 2002, Biogen, Inc. established The Biogen Foundation, a private, U.S. based, non profit philanthropic organization. In December 2002, Biogen, Inc. made a charitable contribution of $15.0 million to fund the Biogen Foundation. As a result of the Merger, we changed the name of the foundation to The Biogen Idec Foundation and, in December 2003 contributed an additional $10.0 million. The foundation is to operate exclusively for the benefit of charitable, educational and scientific purposes. Certain executive officers and other employees serve as directors and officers of the foundation. We classify charitable contributions to other income (expense). In December 2003, we recorded charges of $2.5 million and $18.2 million related to the final settlement of patent infringement disputes with Apoxis S.A. and Corixa Corporation, respectively. These payments were charged to other expense in the fourth quarter of 2003. Acquired In Process Research and Development In the fourth quarter of 2003, we incurred a charge of $823.0 million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D, related to the Merger. The amount expensed as IPR&D represents the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model. For each project, the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 16%. As of December 31, 2004, we estimated future research and development expenses of approximately $65 million, $34 million, and $177 million, respectively, would be incurred to complete the purchased neurology, dermatology, and rheumatology research projects. Since the date of the Merger, November 12, 2003, we have discontinued certain clinical trials. Additionally, in connection with the voluntary suspension of marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI in February 2005, we suspended dosing in clinical trials of TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease and RA. Estimates of expenses are net of any research and development expenses that were shared under collaborations with corporate partners. The projects, which were in various stages of development, from preclinical through Phase III clinical trials, are, unless they have been discontinued, expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 2005 through 2009. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects are that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. No assurance can be given that the 54 Table of Contents underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. Amortization of Intangible Assets In 2004 and 2003, we recorded amortization expense of $347.7 million and $33.2 million, respectively, related to the intangible assets of $3.7 billion acquired in the Merger with Biogen, Inc. Intangible assets consist of $3.0 billion in core technology, $578.0 million in patents and $64.0 million in trademarks. Amortization of the core technology is provided over the estimated useful lives of the technology ranging from 15 to 20 years, based on the greater of straight line basis or economic consumption each period. Amortization of the out licensed patents for which we receive royalties is provided over the remaining lives of the patents of 11 years. Trademarks have an indefinite life and, as such, are not amortized. We review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In the third quarter of 2004, management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE may not be recoverable. As a result, in the third quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $27.8 million to amortization of acquired intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE. If future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations. Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate in 2004 was approximately 61% compared to 1% in 2003 and 36% in 2002. Our effective tax rate for 2004 varied substantially from the U.S. federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the IPR&D write off in 2003, the acquisition related intangible amortization and inventory fair value adjustments arising from purchase accounting related to foreign jurisdictions offset, in part, by the effect of lower income tax rates (less than the 35% U.S. statutory corporate rate) in certain non U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate and tax credits allowed for research and experimentation expenditures in the U.S. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, our adjusted 2004 effective tax rate would have been approximately 32%. Our effective tax rate for 2003 varied substantially from the U.S. federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the pre tax loss resulting from the write off of non deductible IPR&D and other costs in connection with the Merger with Biogen, Inc. which were not deductible for income tax purposes. Excluding the effect of our write off of IPR&D, our 2003 effective tax rate would have been approximately 35%. Our effective tax rate for 2002 was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily because of state taxes. We have tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income. The utilization of our tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the Internal Revenue Code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than 50% in prior years. However, we anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net tax credits. During 2002, we decreased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to zero. Each reporting period we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax liabilities and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are either tax deductible or to which our tax credits may be carried. Based on the evaluation performed as of December 31, 2004, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the entire benefits of our deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Financial Condition We have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through profits and other revenues from our joint business arrangement with Genentech related to the sale of RITUXAN, sales of AVONEX, AMEVIVE, and ZEVALIN, royalty revenues, corporate partner revenues, debt financing transactions and 55 Table of Contents interest income. We expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand, which includes the proceeds from the April and May 2002 issuance of our senior notes, funds from our joint business arrangement with Genentech related to the sale of RITUXAN, commercial sales of AVONEX, AMEVIVE and ZEVALIN, royalties and existing collaborative agreements and contracts, and sales of TYSABRI if we are able to re launch this product which is dependent on the results of our evaluation of the risk of PML and discussions with regulatory authorities. We believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we may, from time to time, seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. Our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including: the continued commercial success of AVONEX and RITUXAN and, to a lesser extent, AMEVIVE and ZEVALIN; the future commercial availability of TYSABRI if we are able to re launch this product; the timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development; the cost of launching new products, and the success of those products; funding and timing of payments related to several significant capital projects, the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing; fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs; levels of resources that we need to devote to the development of manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities, including resources devoted to the marketing of AVONEX, RITUXAN, AMEVIVE, and ZEVALIN and future products, as well as the future marketing and manufacturing of TYSABRI if we are able to re launch this product; technological advances; status of products being developed by competitors; our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations; and working capital required to satisfy the options of holders of our senior notes and subordinated notes to require us to repurchase their notes on specified terms or upon the occurrence of specified events. Until required for operations, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, foreign and U.S. government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale decreased to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2004 from $2.3 billion at December 31, 2003. Our operating activities generated $728.0 million of cash for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $170.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net cash from operating activities includes our net income of $25.1 million, noncash charges of $439.4 million for depreciation and amortization, $289.5 million of impact on sales of stepped up inventory, and $144.6 million of tax benefits related to stock options offset by $135.6 million for deferred income taxes. Our investing activities utilized $382.4 million of cash in 2004 compared to $256.4 million in 2003, and included $361.0 million to fund construction projects and purchase real property and equipment, including our research and development and administration campus in San Diego and manufacturing facility in Oceanside. Cash generated from financing activities included $273.5 million from the issuance of common and treasury stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans offset by $734.4 million used for the repurchase of shares under our repurchase programs in 2004. In April and May 2002, we raised through the issuance of our senior notes, approximately $696 million, net of underwriting commissions and expenses of $18.4 million. Simultaneously with the issuance of the senior notes, we used a portion of the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $135.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The senior notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of 1.75% annually. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of these senior notes during any nine month period commencing on or after April 30, 2007 if the average market price of the senior notes for a five trading day measurement period preceding such nine month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such senior note. The contingent interest payable per senior note with respect of any quarterly period within such nine month period where contingent interest is determined to be payable will equal the greater of (1) the amount of regular cash dividends paid by us per share on our common stock during that quarterly period multiplied by the then applicable conversion rate or (2) 0.0625% of the average market price of a senior note for the five trading day measurement period preceding such nine month period, provided that if we do not pay regular cash dividends during a semiannual period, we will pay contingent 56 Table of Contents interest semiannually at a rate of 0.125% of the average market price of a senior note for the five trading day measurement period immediately preceding such nine month period. Upon maturity, the senior notes will have an aggregate principal face value of $1.2 billion. Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value senior note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into 7.1881 shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $82.49, resulting in total potential common shares to be issued upon conversion of 8.7 million shares. In addition, holders of the senior notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the senior notes on April 29, 2005, 2007, 2012 and 2017 at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase, payable in cash. We expect that on April 29, 2005, holders of the senior notes will require us to purchase all or a substantial portion of the notes which could result in a cash outflow of up to approximately $809 million. This outflow includes payment of the aggregate purchase price of the notes of approximately $753 million plus the payment of tax for which deferred tax liabilities have been previously established related to additional deductible interest expense. As a result, these senior notes are included in notes payable under current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We would be required to liquidate a portion of our marketable securities portfolio to purchase the notes. In addition, if a change in control in our company occurs on or before April 29, 2007, holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their senior notes for cash. We have the right to redeem at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption all or a portion of the senior notes for cash at any time on or after April 29, 2007. In February 1999, we raised through the issuance of our subordinated notes, approximately $112.7 million, net of underwriting commissions and expenses of $3.9 million. The subordinated notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of 5.5% annually. Upon maturity, the subordinated notes will have an aggregate principal face value of $345.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, our remaining indebtedness under the subordinated notes was approximately $219.2 million at maturity, due to conversion of subordinated notes into common stock. Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value subordinated note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into 40.404 shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $8.36 per share. The holders of the subordinated notes may require us to purchase the subordinated notes on February 16, 2009 or 2014 at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase with us having the option to repay the subordinated notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock. We have the right to redeem at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption all or a portion of the subordinated notes for cash at any time. During 2004, holders of subordinated notes with a face value of approximately $125.7 million elected to convert their subordinated notes to approximately 5.1 million shares of our common stock. To date, in the first quarter of 2005, holders of subordinated notes with a face value of approximately $18.1 million elected to convert their subordinated notes to approximately 0.7 million shares of our common stock. In August 2004, we restarted construction of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark to be used to manufacture TYSABRI and other products in our pipeline. The cost of the project is estimated to be $372.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had committed approximately $129.0 million to the project, of which $17.3 million has been paid. We expect this facility to be substantially complete in 2007 and available for commercial production in 2008. As of March 31, 2005, we determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod. As a result, we expect to write off in the first quarter of 2005 to research and development expense approximately $6.5 million of engineering costs which had previously been capitalized. In September 2000, we purchased a 60 acre site in Oceanside, California for approximately $18.9 million in cash. In December 2002, we purchased an additional 27 acres of land at the Oceanside site for $7.9 million. We are building a large scale manufacturing facility at this location, which we anticipate using to manufacture TYSABRI and other commercial products. We have completed construction of this facility and obtained the certificate of occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2004. Commissioning and validation is expected to continue through 2005. We expect the facility to be licensed in 2006. Including start up costs, total costs of this facility upon completion are estimated to be $480.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, we have committed 57 Table of Contents approximately $413.0 million to the construction of this large scale manufacturing facility, of which $388.4 million has been paid. The timing of the anticipated completion, licensing and use of the Oceanside facility and the Hillerod facility is dependent upon the commercial availability and potential market acceptance of TYSABRI. See Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. If TYSABRI is permanently withdrawn from the market, we would need to evaluate our long term plans for these facilities. If we are able to reintroduce TYSABRI to the market, we would need to evaluate our requirements for TYSABRI inventory and additional manufacturing capacity in light of the approved label and our judgment of the potential U.S. market acceptance of TYSABRI in MS, the probability of obtaining marketing approval of TYSABRI in MS in the EU and other jurisdictions, and the probability of obtaining marketing approval of TYSABRI in additional indications in the U.S., EU and other jurisdictions. In June 2004, we commenced construction to add additional research facilities and administrative space to one of our existing buildings in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The cost of the project is estimated to be $65.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had committed approximately $29.0 million to the project, of which $18.5 million had been paid. The project is expected to be substantially complete in late 2005. In September 2001, we purchased approximately 42.6 acres of land in San Diego, California for approximately $31.7 million in cash where we are building a consolidated research and development and administration campus. We substantially completed construction and took occupancy in the building in the fourth quarter of 2004. The estimated total cost of the project is $169.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, we have committed approximately $168.0 million to the construction of this campus, of which $167.0 million has been paid. In February 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 12.0 million shares of our common stock. During 2004, we repurchased all 12.0 million shares at a cost of $698.4 million, completing this program. The repurchased stock provided us with treasury shares to be used for general corporate purposes, such as common stock to be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase plans. In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as common stock to be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase plans. This repurchase program will expire no later than October 4, 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we repurchased 0.6 million shares at a cost of $36.0 million. Approximately 19.4 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this program at December 31, 2004. To date, in the first quarter of 2005, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares under this program, at a cost of $168.5 million. In May 1999, we entered into an arrangement with MDS (Canada) Inc., MDS Nordion Division, successor to MDS Nordion, Inc., or MDS (Canada), under which MDS (Canada) agreed to supply us yttrium 90, a radioisotope used in connection with administering ZEVALIN. MDS (Canada) initially supplied product for use in the ZEVALIN clinical trials. In anticipation of commercial launch of ZEVALIN, we subsequently determined that additional commercial production capacity for yttrium 90 would be necessary. To obtain a commitment from MDS (Canada) that sufficient commercial supply would be available, we agreed to minimum purchase commitments of $55.0 million, and to make periodic cash payments totaling $25.0 million into an escrow account. The supply agreement was amended in November 2001 to give effect to these mutual commitments. In December 2003, in light of the reduced expectations for ZEVALIN sales levels, we agreed to release the $25.0 million of escrowed funds to MDS (Canada), and MDS (Canada) agreed to eliminate the minimum purchase commitments from the supply arrangement. MDS (Canada)s obligation to supply yttrium 90 remains in effect. We are amortizing the prepayment over the economic life of the agreement. In connection with the Merger, we assumed Biogen, Inc.s Retirement Plan, a tax qualified defined benefit pension plan. Prior to November 13, 2003, we did not have a pension plan. Prior to the Merger, the Retirement Plan covered substantially all of Biogen, Inc.s regular U.S. employees and provided compensation 58 Table of Contents credits and interest credits to participants Retirement Plan accounts using a cash balance method. We also assumed Biogen, Inc.s unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or SERP, which covered a select group of highly compensated U.S. employees. The plans are noncontributory. The Retirement Plans benefit formula was based on employee earnings and age. The SERP provided benefits for covered executives in excess of those permitted under the tax qualified Retirement Plan. Biogen, Inc.s funding policy for the plans has been to contribute amounts deductible for federal income tax purposes. Funds contributed to the plans have been invested in fixed income and equity securities. At October 31, 2003, Biogen, Inc. ceased allowing new participants into the plans. Effective December 31, 2003, Biogen, Inc. amended the plans so that no further benefits would accrue to participants. We credited participants cash balance accounts under the Retirement Plan for compensation and interest earned through December 31, 2003. After that date, no further compensation credits will be made, but interest credits will be made until the Retirement Plan benefits have been distributed to participants. We credited participants accounts under the SERP for compensation and interest earned through December 31, 2003. No further compensation credits will be made, but interest credits will be made until the SERP is terminated. In connection with the termination of the Retirement Plan, we requested an Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, ruling that the Plans termination did not adversely affect its tax qualified status. During 2004, our management decided to accelerate the payment and to pay out participants benefits as soon as administratively possible. In December 2004, we began distributing to employees their respective Retirement Plan benefits. Participants had the following options with respect to the value of their Plan distribution: (a) to receive an immediate lump sum payment which may be rolled over into the Biogen Idec 401(k) Savings Plan (401(k) plan) or other designated qualified plan, or (b) to receive an annuity that would begin either immediately or at a deferred date. During 2004, we incurred charges of approximately $2.1 million related to transition benefits associated with the termination of the plans, and plan curtailment costs and additional premium costs related to the annuity transfer of approximately $3.0 million, which are included in our results of operations for 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had a liability of $14.1 million related to these plans, including $7.7 million related to transition benefits associated with the plan terminations. In January 2005, we funded approximately $1.2 million to cover the remaining lump sum benefit payments under the Retirement Plan. Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures We use non GAAP gross margin of product sales measure in the Cost of Product Revenues section and non GAAP effective tax rate measures in the Income Tax Provision section. These are non GAAP financial measures. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of each non GAAP financial measure as well as the reconciliation between each non GAAP financial measure and the GAAP financial measure are presented in the discussions of the non GAAP financial measures. We believe that the non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors. In particular, we believe that the non GAAP financial measures allow investors to monitor and evaluate our ongoing operating results and trends and gain a better understanding of our past performance as well as period to period performance. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding contingent milestone payments totaling $332.5 million under our collaboration and license agreements, and construction commitments disclosed 59 Table of Contents separately under Financial Condition) at December 31, 2004, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 3 4 5 After Years 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In thousands) Non cancelable operating leases $ 133,626 $ 28,112 $ 40,123 $ 27,814 $ 37,577 Other long term obligations 46,862 25,696 16,462 4,704 Total contractual cash obligations $ 180,488 $ 53,808 $ 56,585 $ 32,518 $ 37,577 All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We do not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Collaboration and License Agreements In connection with our research and development efforts, we have entered into various collaboration arrangements which provide us with rights to develop, produce and market products using certain know how, technology and patent rights maintained by the parties. Terms of the various license agreements may require us to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product development objectives and pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. In October 2004, we entered into a development and license agreement with ImmunoGen, Inc., or ImmunoGen, for a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize anticancer therapeutics that comprise an antibody that we have developed to an undisclosed tumor cell target and ImmunoGens proprietary Tumor Activated Prodrug (TAP) technology. As part of the agreement, we paid ImmunoGen an upfront fee of $1.0 million, which was recorded as a research and development expense. Upon the achievement of certain predetermined milestones, we would be required to pay ImmunoGen up to a total of $42.0 million plus royalties over the life of the agreement. ImmunoGen will also receive compensation from us for product development research done on its behalf, as well as for the production of preclinical and initial clinical materials. In August 2004, we entered into a collaborative agreement with Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sunesis, to discover and develop small molecule cancer therapeutics targeting primarily kinases. Under the agreement, we acquired exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize certain compounds resulting from the collaboration. Upon signing the agreement, we paid Sunesis a non refundable upfront license fee of $7.0 million, which was recorded in research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2004. Under the terms of this agreement, we purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of preferred stock of Sunesis for $14.0 million, the fair value of the shares. In December 2002, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement with Sunesis related to the discovery and development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Under the terms of this agreement, we purchased 1.25 million shares of preferred stock of Sunesis for $6.0 million, the fair value of the shares. We acquired certain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize certain compounds resulting from the collaboration. Our investments in Sunesis are included in investments and other assets. We account for our investments in Sunesis using the cost method of accounting, subject to periodic review of impairment. Under the terms of the December 2002 agreement, we will pay Sunesis a quarterly license maintenance fee of $357,500 during the period January 1, 2005 through July 1, 2005. Additionally, we have a Credit Facility Agreement with Sunesis under which we are obligated to loan Sunesis up to $4.0 million. At December 31, 2004, there is $3.2 million of borrowings outstanding. We have committed to paying Sunesis additional amounts upon the completion of certain future research milestones and first and second indication development milestones. If all the milestones were to be achieved in both agreements, we would be required to pay up to an additional $121.0 million over the life of the agreements, excluding royalties. 60 Table of Contents In July 2004, we and Elan entered into a patent license agreement with Genentech for a non exclusive license to certain Genentech patents related to the manufacture of licensed products, including TYSABRI. As a part of the agreement, we and Elan paid a $1.0 million license grant fee upon execution of the agreement, which was charged to research and development expenses, and will pay an additional $1.0 million on the first anniversary of the agreement. In addition, we and Elan each have to pay a development milestone fee of $2.5 million related to the approval of TYSABRI by the FDA in November 2004, half of which was paid in 2004 upon approval of TYSABRI and half of which is payable on the anniversary of such approval. At December 31, 2004, our $2.5 million total milestone fee is included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized to cost of product revenues over the life of the patent. The agreement also requires that we or Elan pay royalties on net sales of TYSABRI and other licensed products. In June 2004, we entered into a collaborative research and development agreement with Vernalis plc, or Vernalis, aimed at advancing research into Vernalis adenosine A2A receptor antagonist program, which targets Parkinsons disease and other central nervous system disorders. Under the agreement, we receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Vernalis lead compound, V2006. We paid Vernalis an initial license fee of $10.0 million in July 2004, which was recorded in research and development expenses in the second quarter of 2004. Terms of the collaborative agreement may require us to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain program objectives and pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. We made an immediate investment of $5.5 million through subscription for approximately 6.2 million new Vernalis common shares, representing 4.19 percent of Vernalis post financing issued share capital, and committed to purchase an additional $4.0 million in the event of future Vernalis financing. Our investment in Vernalis is included in investments and other assets. We account for our investment in Vernalis using the cost method of accounting, subject to periodic review of impairment. Excluding royalties, total potential payments to Vernalis could exceed $100.0 million. In June 2004, we entered into a license agreement with BioWa, Inc., or BioWa, for a worldwide, non exclusive license for research purposes and a worldwide, exclusive license for development and commercialization purposes to certain BioWa intellectual property rights related to monoclonal antibodies. As part of the agreement, we have committed to paying BioWa certain amounts upon the achievement of certain research and clinical milestones. If all the milestones were to be achieved, we would be required to pay BioWa a total of $18.8 million plus royalties over the life of the agreement. In May 2004, we entered into a limited partnership agreement as a limited partner with MPM Bioventures III GP, LP, to create MPM Bioventures Strategic Fund, LP, or the Strategic Fund. The purpose of the Strategic Fund is to make, manage, and supervise investments in biotechnology companies with novel products or technologies that fit strategically with Biogen Idec. The Strategic Fund takes only minority positions in the equity of its investments, and does not seek to engage in day to day management of the entities. We have committed $65.0 million to the Strategic Fund over a three year period. During 2004, we contributed $5.5 million to the Strategic Fund. In April 2004, we became a limited partner in MPM Bioventures III QP, LP, or the LP, a limited partnership that invests in entities that are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, marketing and or sale of novel biological products or technologies. We have committed to contribute $4.0 million to the limited partnership. Through December 31, 2004, we have contributed $1.8 million into the LP, which is included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In September 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a license agreement with Fumapharm AG, or Fumapharm, under which Biogen, Inc. obtained exclusive rights to develop and market a second generation fumarate derivative with an immunomodulatory mechanism of action, which is currently in clinical trials in Europe. Under the terms of this agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution license for psoriasis, and a production and exclusive marketing and distribution license for the entire world for MS. During 2004, we made payments totaling $4.2 million to Fumapharm for the achievement of certain milestones, which were expensed to research and development expense. We have committed to paying Fumapharm additional amounts upon the completion of certain future research milestones and first and 61 Table of Contents second indication development milestones. If all the milestones were to be achieved, we would be required to pay up to an additional 20.0 million Swiss francs plus royalties over the remaining life of the agreement. In August 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement with Vetter Pharma Fertigung GmbH & Co. KG, or Vetter, for the fill finish of our products. Under the terms of this agreement, we made a partial advance payment to Vetter of 35.0 million Euros in return for reserving certain capacity at Vetters fill finish facility. As of December 31, 2004, we have made payments totaling $22.7 million to Vetter for the achievement of certain milestones achieved under the terms of our supply agreement for reserving certain capacity at Vetters fill finish facility. These payments are recorded in investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The asset will be amortized to cost of product revenues over the units produced upon delivery to Biogen Idec. We have total potential milestone payments of approximately 16.0 million euros remaining as part of the agreement. In September 2001, we entered into a collaborative development agreement with Mitsubishi Pharma to support clinical development of anti CD80 (anti B7.1) antibody products developed using our Primatized antibody technology. Under the terms of an existing license agreement with Mitsubishi Pharma, entered into in November 1993, Mitsubishi Pharma had an exclusive license in Asia to develop and commercialize anti CD80 (anti B7.1) antibody products. These agreements were terminated in December 2003. As a result of the termination of these agreements, we have no continuing financial obligations under these agreements. During 2003 and 2002, we recognized revenues from these agreements of $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. Under these agreements, amounts earned by us and recognized as revenue for contract research and development approximated the research and development expenses incurred under the related agreement. In August 2000, Biogen, Inc. entered into a development and marketing collaboration agreement with Elan to collaborate in the development, manufacture and commercialization of TYSABRI. In November 2004, we received approval by the FDA to market TYSABRI as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS to reduce frequency of clinical relapses. We are also developing TYSABRI as a potential treatment for Crohns disease and RA. In February 2005, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI and suspended dosing in clinical trials of TYSABRI. See Overview for a description of the suspension and related events. Under the terms of this agreement, we share costs with Elan for on going development activities. As of December 31, 2004, Elan owed us $34.4 million, representing commercialization and development expenses that we incurred, which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We received the entire $34.4 million from Elan in the first quarter of 2005 related to the receivable. In June 1999, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Schering AG, or Schering, aimed at the development and commercialization of ZEVALIN. Under the terms of the agreement, we may receive milestone and research and development support payments totaling up to $47.5 million, subject to the attainment of product development objectives. Schering received exclusive marketing and distribution rights to ZEVALIN outside the U.S., and we will receive royalties on product sales by Schering. Under the terms of a separate supply agreement, we are obligated to meet Scherings clinical and commercial requirements for ZEVALIN. Schering may terminate these agreements for any reason. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recognized revenues from our agreements with Schering of $10.0 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. In the first quarter of 2004, we received a $10.0 million payment from Schering for the EMEA grant of marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU. The payment represented, in part, a milestone payment to compensate us for preparing, generating, and collecting data that was critical to the EMEA marketing approval process, and to which we have no continuing involvement. Under the above agreement, amounts earned by us and recognized as revenue for contract research and development approximate the research and development expenses incurred under the related agreement. In December 1994, we entered into a collaborative development agreement and a license agreement with Seikagaku, aimed at the development and commercialization of an anti CD23 antibody using Primatized antibody technology. During 2003 and 2002, we recognized revenues from our agreement with Seikagaku of 62 Table of Contents $0.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. Although this agreement was terminated effective January 17, 2004, we have certain continuing obligations under the agreement that we expect to fulfill in the first half of 2005 and for which we would receive revenue from Seikagaku. Under the above agreement, amounts earned by us and recognized as revenue for contract research and development approximate the research and development expenses incurred under the related agreement. As part of previous agreements that Biogen, Inc. had with Targeted Genetics Corporation, or Targeted, for gene therapy research and development, we own approximately 12.1 million shares of Targeteds common stock with a fair value of $18.8 million, which is included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In the third quarter of 2004, we recognized a $12.7 million charge for the impairment of our Targeted investment that was determined to be other than temporary. We have no remaining commitments or obligations with Targeted. Legal Matters On March 2, 2005, we, along with William H. Rastetter, our Executive Chairman, and James C. Mullen, our Chief Executive Officer, were named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit, captioned Brown v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder. The action is purportedly brought on behalf of all purchasers of our publicly traded securities between February 18, 2004 and February 25, 2005. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI in order to gain accelerated approval from the FDA for the products distribution and sale. The plaintiff alleges that these materially false and misleading statements harmed the purported class by artificially inflating our stock price during the purported class period and that company insiders benefited personally from the inflated price by selling our stock. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, as well as interest, cost and attorneys fees. A substantially similar action, captioned Grill v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al., was filed on March 10, 2005 in the same court by another purported class representative. We believe that the actions are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously. At this stage of litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. On March 4, 2005, a purported shareholder derivative action, captioned Halpern v. Rastetter, et al., was filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, in New Castle County, on our behalf of Biogen Idec Inc., against us as nominal defendant, our Board of Directors and our former general counsel. The plaintiff derivatively claims breaches of fiduciary duty by the Board of Directors for inadequate oversight of our policies, practices, controls and assets, and for recklessly awarding executive bonuses despite alleged awareness of potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI and the potential for related harm to our financial position. The plaintiff also derivatively claims that our Executive Chairman, former general counsel and a director misappropriated confidential company information for personal profit by selling our stock while in possession of material, non public information regarding the potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI, and alleges that our Board of Directors did not ensure that appropriate policies were in place regarding the control of confidential information and personal trading in our securities by officers and directors. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, profits, the return of all bonuses paid by us, costs and attorneys fees. A substantially similar action, captioned Golaine v. Rastetter, et al., was filed on March 14, 2005 in the same court. Neither of the plaintiffs made presuit demand on our Board of Directors prior to filing their respective actions. As required by applicable law, we and our Board of Directors are considering the derivative claims in the complaints and will respond in a time and manner consistent with applicable Delaware statutory and common law. The purported derivative actions do not seek affirmative relief from the company. On March 9, 2005, two additional purported shareholder derivative actions, captioned Carmona v. Mullen, et al. and Fink v. Mullen, et al., were brought in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego, on our behalf, against us as nominal defendant, our Board of Directors and our chief financial officer. The plaintiffs derivatively claim breach of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment against all defendants. The plaintiffs also derivatively claim insider selling in violation of California Corporations Code 25402 and breach of fiduciary duty and 63 Table of Contents misappropriation of information against certain defendants who sold our securities during the period of February 18, 2004 to the date of the complaints. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants caused and or allowed us to issue, and conspired, aided and abetted and acted in concert in concealing that we were issuing, false and misleading press releases about the safety of TYSABRI and its financial prospects which resulted in legal claims being asserted against us, irreparable harm to our corporate image, depression of our stock price and impairment of our ability to raise capital. The plaintiffs also allege that certain defendants sold personally owned shares of our stock while in possession of material, undisclosed, adverse information. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, treble damages for the purported insider trading in violation of California Corporate Code 25402, equitable relief including restriction of the defendants trading proceeds or other assets, restitution, disgorgement and costs, including attorneys fees and expenses. Neither of the plaintiffs made presuit demand on our Board of Directors prior to filing their respective actions. As required by applicable law, we and our Board of Directors are considering the derivative claims in the complaints and will respond in a time and manner consistent with applicable statutory and common law. The purported derivative actions do not seek affirmative relief from the company. Our Board of Directors has received letters, dated March 1 and 15, 2005, respectively, on behalf of purported owners of our securities purportedly constituting demands under Delaware law. A supplement to the March 1 letter was received on March 2, 2005. The letters generally allege that certain of our officers and directors breached their fiduciary duty to us by selling personally held shares our securities while in possession of material, non public information about potential serious side effects of TYSABRI. The letters generally request that our Board of Directors take action on our behalf to recover compensation and profits from the officers and directors, consider enhanced corporate governance controls related to the sales of securities by insiders, and pursue other such equitable relief, damages, and other remedies as may be appropriate. As required by applicable law, our Board of Directors is currently considering the letters and will respond in a time and manner consistent with Delaware law. We are providing information to the SEC regarding the SECs informal inquiry into the suspension of marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI and trading in our securities by certain of our directors, officers and employees. On July 15, 2003, Biogen, Inc. (now Biogen Idec MA, Inc., one of our wholly owned subsidiaries), along with Genzyme Corporation and Abbott Bioresearch Center, Inc., filed suit against The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York, or Columbia, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, contending that we no longer have any obligation to pay royalties to Columbia on sales of our products under a 1993 license agreement between us and Columbia related to U.S. Patent Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665, and 5,179,017, also referred to as the Original Patents, or under a newly issued patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,455,275, also referred to as the 275 patent (the 2003 action). Based, in part, on the courts subsequent finding that we had made a strong showing that we might prevail in proving the 275 patent is invalid under the doctrine of non statutory double patenting, Columbia has since covenanted not to sue Biogen Idec MA, Inc. on any claim of the 275 patent and any claim that is the same or substantially the same as the claims of the 275 patent if such claim(s) emerge from the reexamination or reissue proceedings currently pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, with respect to the 275 patent. As a result of Columbias covenant not to sue, and Columbias assertion that Biogen Idec MA, Inc. is a licensee in good standing, the court issued an order on November 5, 2004, in which it dismissed Biogen Idec MA Inc.s claims for declaratory relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. At this time, we are unable to predict whether any claims will issue from the USPTO on the reexamination or reissue proceedings concerning the 275 patent, or whether, if any claims do issue, such claims will pose a risk of infringement with respect to our activities. On September 17, 2004, Biogen Idec Inc., Biogen Idec MA, Inc., and Genzyme Corporation, filed suit against Columbia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the 2004 action). In the 2004 action we reasserted some of the contentions made in our complaint in the action filed in 2003 action. For example, that we are seeking a declaratory judgment that we have no obligation to pay any further royalties under the license agreement because the Original Patents have expired and the 275 patent is invalid and unenforceable; and that Columbia should be permanently enjoined from demanding any further royalties based on the 275 patent or on any pending continuations, continuations in part, or divisional applications of 64 Table of Contents the Original Patents. We have also asserted claims for relief based on abuse of process, breach of contract, violation of Massachusetts laws concerning unfair and deceptive trade practices, prosecution laches and inequitable conduct. To date, Columbia has refused to extend its covenant not to sue on the 275 patent to Biogen Idec Inc. In the event that we are unsuccessful in the present litigation and Columbia asserts a claim for infringement against Biogen Idec Inc., we may be liable for damages suffered by Columbia with respect to unpaid royalties and such other relief as Columbia may seek and be granted by the Court. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. On August 10, 2004, Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. filed suit against us, GlaxoSmithKline, Chiron Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., and Kaiser Permanente, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, contending that we induced infringement of U.S. patents 6,420,139, 6,638,739, 5,728,385, and 5,723,283, all of which are directed to various methods of immunization or determination of immunization schedules. The inducement of infringement claims are based on allegations that we provided instructions and or recommendations on a proper immunization schedule for vaccines to other defendants who are alleged to have directly infringed the patents at issue. We are investigating the allegations, however, we do not believe them to be based in fact. Under our 1988 license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, GlaxoSmithKline is obligated to indemnify and defend us against these claims. In the event that the nature of the claims change such that GlaxoSmithKline is no longer obligated to indemnify and defend us and we are unsuccessful in the present litigation we may be liable for damages suffered by Classen and such other relief as Classen may seek and be granted by the court. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. Along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, Biogen, Inc. (now Biogen Idec MA, Inc., one of our wholly owned subsidiaries) or, in certain cases, Biogen Idec Inc., was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed by the County of Suffolk, New York, the County of Westchester, New York, the County of Rockland, New York, the County of Nassau, New York, the County of Onondaga, New York, the County of Chenango, New York, the County of Erie, New York, the City of New York, and the County of Chautauqua, New York. All of the cases are pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, with the exception of the Onondaga, Chenango and Chautauqua lawsuits, which are expected to be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and the Erie lawsuit, which is pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of Erie. The complaints allege that the defendants fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for certain drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement, also referred to as Covered Drugs; marketed and promoted the sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the providers ability to collect inflated payments from the government and Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for competing drugs; provided financing incentives to providers to over prescribe Covered Drugs or to prescribe Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs,; and overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered Drugs reimbursements. The complaints allege violations of New York state law and advance common law claims for unfair trade practices, fraud, and unjust enrichment. In addition, all of the complaints, with the exception of the County of Erie, allege that the defendants failed to accurately report the best price on the Covered Drugs to the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to rebate agreements entered into with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and excluded from their reporting certain drugs offered at discounts and other rebates that would have reduced the best price. The Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, and Nassau County complaints also claim that Biogen violated the Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) 18 U.S.C. 1962(c). In September 2003, Biogen joined other named defendants in filing a motion to dismiss the Suffolk County complaint. Biogen also separately filed a motion on its own behalf arguing that the plaintiffs made no specific factual allegations against Biogen to connect it with the alleged scheme. In September 2004, the court, in ruling on defendants joint motion to dismiss, allowed the motion, in part, and dismissed the RICO claim, the Medicaid best price claim, the breach of contract claim, and the common law fraud claim. The court did not dismiss the claims brought under the New York State Medicaid and Social Services statutes, the unfair trade practices claim, or the claim for unjust enrichment. In October 2004, the court issued a partial decision on Biogens individual motion to dismiss. The court dismissed all of the state law claims against Biogen based on the alleged failure to report best price, but deferred ruling on the fraud based claims and ordered Suffolk County to produce all documents in support of its fraud based claims. Suffolk County subsequently produced 65 Table of Contents documents in response to the courts request and Biogen renewed its motion to dismiss. Neither Biogen nor the other defendants have answered or responded to the other complaints, as all of the plaintiffs except Erie County have agreed to stay the time to respond until the resolution of the pending motion to dismiss the Suffolk County complaints. Biogen Idec intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the allegations and claims in these lawsuits. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. In addition, we are involved in certain other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal business activities. While the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances, marketable securities, derivative and hedging activities, inventories, patents, income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, impairment for intangible assets and goodwill, valuation of long lived assets and investments, research and development, loans, pensions, retiree medical plan, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, or SAB 101, superceded in part by SAB 104, provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. SAB 104 establishes the SECs view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. SAB 104 also requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized. We believe that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 104. Product revenue consists of sales from our four products: AVONEX, AMEVIVE, ZEVALIN, and TYSABRI. The timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings. Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, typically upon delivery. Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns, patient assistance, trade term discounts, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration rebates, and managed care discounts and other applicable allowances. Included in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003, are allowances for returns, rebates, discounts and other allowances which totaled $33.8 million and $20.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, our allowance for product returns was $5.2 million. At December 31, 2004, total discounts and allowances were approximately 1.8% of total current assets and less than 1% of total assets. We prepare our estimates for sales returns and allowances, discounts and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. If actual future results vary, we may need to adjust our estimates, which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment. In the past, our estimates based on historical experience have not materially differed from actual results. We closely monitor levels of inventory in the distribution channel. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately, on average, 1 to 3 weeks of inventory in the distribution channel. The shelf life associated with 66 Table of Contents our products is long (15 to 30 months, depending on the product); therefore obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern, given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel. Changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us. We do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, we recorded $169.3 million, $13.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in our consolidated statements of income related to sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates. Our sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates in 2004 were substantially higher than 2003, since sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates related to AVONEX and AMEVIVE were included in our results of operations for all of 2004 as opposed to 2003, when sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates related to AVONEX and AMEVIVE were included in our results of operations only for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. In 2004, the amount of product returns was approximately 1% of product revenue for all our products. Product returns were $17.4 million, $3.7 million and $0.5 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Product returns in 2004 included $3.2 million related to product sales made prior to 2004. During 2004, we had encountered problems in manufacturing our pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX. As a result, we had an increase in our expected level of returns related to batches that failed to meet specifications. In November 2004, we received regulatory approval in the U.S. of TYSABRI for the treatment of MS and paid a $7.0 million approval based milestone to Elan. Upon approval, we also became obligated to provide Elan with $5.3 million in credits for payments on certain purchases of TYSABRI and for reimbursement of commercialization costs. Elan can apply $1.5 million of the credits per year. The approval and credit milestones were capitalized upon approval in investments and other assets and are being amortized over the remaining patent life of 15.7 years. The amortization of the approval and credit milestones is being recorded as a reduction of revenue. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. Under our agreement with Elan, we manufacture TYSABRI and, in the U.S. prior to the suspension, sold TYSABRI to Elan who then distributed TYSABRI to third party distributors. In the U.S., we record revenue when TYSABRI is shipped from Elan to third party distributors. In December 2004, we recorded $3.1 million of product revenues related to sales of TYSABRI to Elan. Additionally, as of December 31, 2004, we deferred $1.9 million in revenue related to sales of TYSABRI, which had not yet been shipped by Elan. As of December 31, 2004, Elan owed us $34.4 million, representing commercialization and development expenses incurred by us to be reimbursed by Elan, which we received from Elan in the first quarter of 2005. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of the RITUXAN pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with Genentech, reimbursement from Genentech of our RITUXAN related sales force and development expenses and royalties from Genentech for sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Under the copromotion arrangement, all U.S. sales of RITUXAN and associated costs and expenses are recognized by Genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis, as defined in our amended and restated collaboration agreement with Genentech. Pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking U.S. net sales of RITUXAN to third party customers less cost of sales, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. Our profit sharing formula with Genentech has two tiers; we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met. The profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier. In June 2003, we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with Genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti CD20 antibodies targeting B cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of indications. Upon approval of the first new anti CD20 product, the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and other anti CD20 products will change over a period of time to a fixed annual profit sharing percentage at the lower tier. Currently, we record our share of expenses incurred for the development of new anti CD20 products in research and development expense until such time as a new product is approved, 67 Table of Contents at which time we will record our share of pretax copromotion profits related to the new product in revenues from unconsolidated joint business. We record our royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a cash basis. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of new anti CD20 products and only for the first eleven years from the date of first commercial sale of such new anti CD20 products. In February 2002, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, released EITF Issue No. 01 09 or EITF 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products). EITF 01 09 states that cash consideration (including a sales incentive) given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendors products or services and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendors income statement, rather than a sales and marketing expense. We have various contracts with distributors that provide for discounts and rebates. These contracts are classified as a reduction of revenue. We also maintain select customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel. In accordance with EITF 01 09, we have established the fair value of these contracts and, as provided by EITF 01 09, classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense. If we had concluded that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for these contracts, we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue. We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which the we have rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us (adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate). We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees. There are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements. Under this policy, revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution of royalty disputes and arbitration. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required, which could affect future earnings. Biogen, Inc. Purchase Price Allocation The purchase price related to the Merger was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date. An independent third party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of in process research and development, identifiable intangible assets, inventory and certain property, plant and equipment, and in determining the useful lives of such tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects, determining the product life and term of estimated future cash flows, and developing appropriate costs, expenses, depreciation and amortization assumptions, tax rates, discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions. These assumptions are based on the best available information that we had at the time. Additionally, certain estimates for the purchase price allocation related to income taxes may change as subsequent information becomes available. Marketable Securities We invest our excess cash balances in short term and long term marketable securities, principally corporate notes and government securities. At December 31, 2004, substantially all of our securities were 68 Table of Contents classified as available for sale. All available for sale securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in shareholders equity, net of related tax effects. Realized gains and losses and declines in value, if any, judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in other expense. In 2004, we recognized a charge of approximately $5.7 million for certain unrealized losses on available for sale securities that were determined to be other than temporary, because we believe the securities will be sold prior to a potential recovery of their decline in value. Any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings. The cost of available for sale securities sold is based on the specific identification method. We have established guidelines that maintain safety and provide adequate liquidity in our available for sale portfolio. These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates. As part of our strategic product development efforts, we invest in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, addresses the accounting for investment in marketable equity securities. As a matter of policy, we determine on a quarterly basis whether any decline in the fair value of a marketable security is temporary or other than temporary. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity, net of related tax effects. If a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is determined to be other than temporary, such marketable security is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings. The factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security, the duration of the securitys decline, and prospects for the company, including favorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements. In 2004, we recognized a $12.7 million charge for the impairment of an investment that was determined to be other than temporary. Any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings. At December 31, 2004, we had no unrealized losses related to these marketable securities. The fair market value of these marketable securities totaled $29.4 million at December 31, 2004. We also invest in equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and fair value is not readily available. These investments are recorded using the cost method of accounting and, as a matter of policy, we monitor these investments in private securities on a quarterly basis, and determine whether any impairment in their value would require a charge to current earnings, based on the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee, market prices of comparable public companies, and general market conditions. At December 31, 2004, we included approximately $33.9 million of investments in private securities in investments and other assets. There were no significant charges to current earnings in 2004, 2003 or 2002 for impairments of these investments. Recognition of impairments for these securities may cause variability in earnings. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval, including safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause 69 Table of Contents delay in commercialization. We are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. There is a risk inherent in these judgments, which is the reason we disclose the risk and the potential for a change in judgment. At December 31, 2004, all products included in inventory have been approved for sale by either the EMEA or FDA. In February 2005, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI based on reports of two serious adverse events that occurred in patients treated with TYSABRI in combination with AVONEX in MS clinical studies. These events involved two cases, of PML, a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. In light of the two reports of PML, the companies initiated a systematic review of the TYSABRI safety database. On March 30, 2005, we and Elan announced that the review of the safety database led a serious adverse event previously reported by a clinical investigator in a clinical study of TYSABRI in Crohns disease to be reassessed as PML. The case was originally reported by the investigator as malignant astrocytoma in July 2003. The patient died in December 2003. The patient had received 8 doses of TYSABRI over an 18 month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents. We and Elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML. The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine future commercial availability. We cannot predict the outcome of these evaluations. An unfavorable or inconclusive outcome could result in the permanent withdrawal of TYSABRI from the market and termination of clinical studies of TYSABRI, or the re introduction of TYSABRI to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses, blackbox or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions, requirements and limitations as the FDA may require. While we presently believe that we will be able to find a path forward for TYSABRI, there are no assurances as to the likelihood of success. In light of our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that our TYSABRI inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we have written down all of the $19.1 million of TYSABRI inventory that had been included on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2004, which was charged to cost of product revenues. We are continuing to manufacture TYSABRI. Because of the uncertainty described above, in the first quarter of 2005, we also expect to expense between $22 million and $25 million of TYSABRI that was manufactured in the first quarter of 2005. In subsequent periods, we will continue to assess TYSABRI to determine if it needs to be expensed in light of existing information related to the potential future commercial availability of TYSABRI and applicable accounting standards. See Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Futures Results Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect Our Growth. We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write offs may be required. This periodic review led to the write downs of TYSABRI inventory as of December 31, 2004 and the expensing of TYSABRI expected to occur in the first quarter of 2005, as described above, and may lead us to expense TYSABRI in subsequent periods. Also included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration, in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value. We wrote down $46.7 million of unmarketable inventory during 2004, which was charged to cost of product revenues and consisted of $16.2 million related to AVONEX, $9.7 million related to ZEVALIN, $1.7 million related to AMEVIVE and $19.1 million to TYSABRI. The AVONEX and AMEVIVE inventory was written down to net realizable value when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications. The ZEVALIN inventory was written down to net realizable value when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications as well as a determination that certain of the inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand. 70 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income tax expense includes a provision for income tax contingencies, which we believe is adequate and appropriate. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of viable tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development costs, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators, are expensed as incurred. The timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense. Clinical trial costs include costs associated with contract research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of management fees, site management and site monitoring costs, and data management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial costs and estimated clinical trial costs have not been material and are adjusted for in the period which they become known. Under this policy, research and development expense can vary due to accrual adjustments related to clinical trials. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We have operations in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada in connection with the sale of AVONEX. We also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Euro, Swedish krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Swiss Franc and Canadian dollar). We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk and do not engage in currency speculation. We use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, or SFAS 133, requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. We assess, both at their inception and on an on going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. We assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument, and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings. Under this policy, and in accordance 71 Table of Contents with SFAS 133, earnings may vary if the forecasted transaction does not occur, or if there is material hedge ineffectiveness or if the hedge ceases to be highly effective. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets to be held and used, including intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Long lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell. In the third quarter of 2004, management determined that certain clinical trials would be discontinued or would not be initiated which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets might not be recoverable. As a result, in the third quarter of 2004, we recorded a charge of approximately $27.8 million to amortization of intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to the valuation of certain core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE to its net realizable value. If future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of certain of these remaining assets may not be recoverable, we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations. In February 2005, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI based on reports of two serious adverse events that have occurred in patients treated with TYSABRI in combination with AVONEX in MS clinical studies. These events involved two cases of PML, a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. In light of the two reports of PML, the companies initiated a systemic review of the TYSABRI safety database. On March 30, 2005, we and Elan announced that the review of the safety database led a serious adverse event previously reported by a clinical investigator in a clinical study of TYSABRI in Crohns disease to be reassessed as PML. The case was originally reported by the investigator as malignant astrocytoma in July 2003. The patient died in December 2003. The patient had received 8 doses of TYSABRI over an 18 month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents. We and Elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML. The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re initiation of dosing in clinical studies and future commercial availability. We cannot predict the outcome of these evaluations. An unfavorable or inconclusive outcome could result in the permanent withdrawal of TYSABRI from the market and termination of clinical studies of TYSABRI, or the re introduction of TYSABRI to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses, blackbox or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions, requirements and limitations as the FDA may require. As a result of these events, we have assessed our long lived assets related to TYSABRI, which include intangible assets and facilities, and have determined that there are no impairments related to these assets as a result of the suspension of the marketing of TYSABRI. However, should new information arise, we may be required to take impairment charges related to certain of our long lived assets. See Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. Goodwill Goodwill associated with the Merger represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather subject to periodic review for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill might not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we performed an assessment of our goodwill, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired at October 31, 2004. 72 Table of Contents As a result of the voluntary suspension of TYSABRI in February 2005, we have performed an interim review for impairment. We believe that the fair value of our legacy Biogen, Inc. reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and therefore, we believe goodwill is properly valued as of the date of the filing of our 2004 Form 10 K. However, should new information arise, we may need to reassess goodwill for impairment in light of the new information and we may be required to take impairment charges related to goodwill. See Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. Notes Payable In connection with our senior and subordinated notes payable, we capitalized certain issuance costs, which are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated outstanding term of the notes, according to EITF 86 15, Increasing Rate Debt. We currently expect that holders of the senior notes due in 2032 will require us to purchase all or a portion of the senior notes on April 29, 2005. As a result, we have reassessed the estimated term of this debt, and recorded additional interest expense of approximately $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. We have also classified our senior notes as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. The remaining unamortized issuance costs of approximately $9.7 million will be amortized through April 29, 2005. Contingencies and Litigation There has been, and we expect there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices, regulatory issues, pricing, and patents and other intellectual property rights. Certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future, including in the litigation described under Legal Matters, could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Standards EITF 03 01, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, was issued in February 2004. EITF 03 01 stipulates disclosure requirements for investments with unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. We have complied with the disclosure provisions of EITF 03 01. In September 2004, the FASB staff issued two proposed FASB Staff Positions: Proposed FSP EITF Issue 03 01 a, which provides guidance for the application of paragraph 16 of EITF Issue 03 01 to debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases, and Proposed FSP EITF Issue 03 01 b, which delays the effective date of Issue 03 01 for debt securities that are impaired because of interests rate and or sector spread increases. We are currently monitoring these developments and assessing the impact these will have on our results of operations. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payments, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) will require all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS 123(R) will be effective for public companies for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and offers alternative methods for determining the fair value. We expect that SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on our financial statements. At the present time, we have not yet determined which valuation method we will use. The FASB has proposed amending SFAS 128, Earnings per Share, to make it consistent with International Accounting Standard 33, Earnings per Share, and make earnings per share, or EPS, computations comparable on a global basis. Under the proposed amendment, the year to date EPS computation would be performed independently from the quarterly computations. Additionally, for all contracts that may be settled in either cash or shares of stock, companies must assume that settlement will occur by the issuance of shares for purposes of computing diluted EPS, even if they intend to settle by paying cash or have a history of cash only settlements, regardless of who controls the means of settlement. Lastly, 73 Table of Contents under the proposed amendment, shares that will be issued upon conversion of a mandatory convertible security must be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing basic EPS from the date that conversion becomes mandatory, using the if converted method, regardless of whether the result is anti dilutive. The proposed amended standard is expected to be issued during the first quarter of 2005. Retrospective application in all periods presented would be required, and could require the conformance of previously reported EPS. We do not expect the provisions of the amended SFAS 128 will have a significant impact on our results of operations. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, which amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). This Statement amends ARB 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this Statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the provisions of SFAS 151 will have a significant impact on our results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, Exchanges of Non Monetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, which eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. This Statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of this Statement shall be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the provisions of SFAS 153 will have a significant impact on our results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 02 14, Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock, which requires an investor that has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee to apply the equity method of accounting only when it has an investment(s) in common stock and or an investment that is in substance common stock. The Task Force also reached a consensus on the definition of in substance common stock and related guidance. The provisions of EITF 02 14 are effective for reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004, and have not had any impact on our accounting for investments as of December 31, 2004. Under EITF No. 04 01, Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination, the EITF reached a consensus that the consummation of a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists, thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination. Under EITF 04 01, the acquisition of a right that the acquiring entity had previously granted to the acquired entity to use the acquirers recognized or unrecognized intangible assets (for example, rights to the acquirers trade name under a franchise agreement or rights to the acquirers technology under a technology licensing agreement) should be included as part of the business combination and recorded by the acquiring entity as an intangible asset at fair value. If the contract giving rise to the reacquired right includes terms that are favorable or unfavorable when compared to pricing (for example, royalty rates) for current market transactions for the same or similar items, an entity should measure a settlement gain or loss as the lesser of (a) the amount by which the contract is favorable or unfavorable to market terms from the perspective of the acquirer or (b) the stated settlement provisions of the contract available to the counterparty to which the contract is unfavorable. EITF 04 01 is effective for all business combinations consummated and goodwill impairment tests (i.e., in step 2 of the impairment test) performed in reporting periods beginning after October 13, 2004. The provisions of EITF 04 01 have not had any significant impact on our results of operations in 2004. 74 Table of Contents Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Controls and Procedures We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2004. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of that period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year beginning in 2004, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we have identified a number of changes that need to be made to our internal controls, primarily related to better documentation of internal controls, and related changes to information systems used in financial reporting. We continued to make these changes during the fourth quarter of 2004. The changes during the fourth quarter of 2004 did not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a companys board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 75 Table of Contents controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F 51 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.
