Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K, beginning on page F 1. Overview Biogen Idec creates new standards of care in oncology, neurology and immunology. As a global leader in the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of novel therapies, we transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare. We currently have five products: AVONEX (interferon beta 1a). AVONEX is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, or MS, and is the most prescribed therapeutic product in MS worldwide. Globally over 130,000 patients have chosen AVONEX as their treatment of choice. RITUXAN (rituximab). RITUXAN is approved worldwide for the treatment of relapsed or refractory low grade or follicular, CD20 positive, B cell non Hodgkins lymphomas, or NHLs. In February 2006, RITUXAN was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to treat previously untreated patients with diffuse, large B cell NHL in combination with anthracycline based chemotherapy regimens. In addition, in February 2006, the FDA approved the supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, for use of RITUXAN, in combination with methotrexate, for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. We market RITUXAN in the United States, or U.S., in collaboration with Genentech, Inc., or Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis. Roche sells RITUXAN outside the U.S., except in Japan where it co markets RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku. We are working with Genentech and Roche on the development of RITUXAN in additional oncology and other indications. TYSABRI (natalizumab). TYSABRI was approved by the FDA in November 2004 to treat relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan Corporation plc, or Elan, voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. In addition, we suspended dosing in clinical studies of TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease and RA. These decisions were based on reports of cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, in patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies. We and Elan conducted a safety evaluation of patients treated with TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease and RA clinical studies. The safety evaluation included the review of any reports of potential PML in MS patients receiving TYSABRI in the commercial setting. In October 2005, we completed the safety evaluation of TYSABRI and found no new confirmed cases of PML. Three confirmed cases of PML were previously reported, two of which were fatal. In September 2005, we submitted an sBLA for TYSABRI to the FDA for the treatment of MS. The sBLA includes: final two year data from the Phase 3 AFFIRM monotherapy trial and SENTINEL combination trial with AVONEX in MS; the integrated safety assessment of patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical trials; and a revised label and a risk minimization action plan. We and Elan have also submitted a similar data package to the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA. This information was supplied as part of the ongoing EMEA review process, which was initiated in the summer of 2004 with the filing for approval of TYSABRI as a treatment for MS. In November 2005, we were granted Priority Review status for the sBLA, which will result in action by the FDA approximately six months from the submission date, or by March 2006. In January 2006, we and Elan announced that we had received notification from the FDA that the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee would review TYSABRI for the treatment of MS on March 7, 2006. In February 2006, we and Elan announced that the FDA informed the companies that they removed the hold on clinical trial dosing of TYSABRI. We and Elan expect to begin an open label, multi center safety extension study of TYSABRI monotherapy in the U.S. and internationally in the coming weeks. We plan to work with regulatory authorities to determine the future commercial availability of TYSABRI. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. 48 Table of Contents ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan). The ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen, which features ZEVALIN, is a radioimmunotherapy that is approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low grade, follicular, or transformed B cell NHL, including patients with RITUXAN relapsed or refractory NHL. ZEVALIN is approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with CD20+ follicular B cell NHL who are refractory to or have relapsed following RITUXAN therapy. We sell ZEVALIN to Schering AG for distribution in the EU, and receive royalty revenues from Schering AG on sales of ZEVALIN in the EU. AMEVIVE (alefacept). AMEVIVE is approved in the U.S. and other countries for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. We are seeking to divest AMEVIVE as part of a comprehensive strategic plan which is discussed below. We also receive royalty revenues on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control, including on sales by Schering AG of ZEVALIN in the EU. In addition, we have a number of ongoing research and development programs in our core therapeutic areas and in other areas of interest. Comprehensive Strategic Plan In September 2005, we began implementing a comprehensive strategic plan designed to position us for long term growth. The plan builds on the continuing strength of AVONEX and RITUXAN and other expected near term developments. The plan has three principal elements: reducing operating expenses and enhancing economic flexibility by recalibrating our asset base, geographic site missions, staffing levels and business processes; committing significant additional capital to external business development and research opportunities; and changing our organizational culture to enhance innovation and support the first two elements of the plan. In conjunction with the plan, we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management layers and staff functions, resulting in the reduction of our workforce by approximately 17%, or approximately 650 positions worldwide. These adjustments took place across company functions, departments and sites, and were substantially implemented. In addition, we are seeking to divest several other non core assets, including AMEVIVE, our NICO clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California and certain real property in Oceanside, California. Our AMEVIVE assets held for sale include $8.0 million related to intangible assets, net, and $5.4 million for property, plant and equipment, net. In February 2006, we sold the NICO clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California to Genentech. Merger On November 12, 2003, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Biogen, Inc. completed a merger transaction, or the Merger, resulting in Biogen, Inc. becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The business combination was treated as an acquisition of Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation for accounting purposes. In connection with the Merger, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation changed its name to Biogen Idec Inc. The discussions for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 in this Form 10 K represent our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and include the results of operations of the merged companies. The discussions for the year ended December 31, 2003 in this Form 10 K, unless indicated otherwise, represent our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and include the results of operations of Biogen, Inc. for the period commencing November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003 only. The results of operations of Biogen, Inc. (revenues and expenses) for the period commencing January 1, 2003 through November 12, 2003, unless indicated otherwise, are excluded from this Form 10 K. 49 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Product sales United States $ 997,671 $ 986,050 $ 121,589 Rest of world 619,333 500,294 49,972 Total product sales 1,617,004 1,486,344 171,561 Revenue from unconsolidated joint business 708,881 615,743 493,049 Royalties 93,193 98,945 12,010 Corporate partner revenue 3,422 10,530 2,563 Total revenues $ 2,422,500 $ 2,211,562 $ 679,183 Product Sales 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) AVONEX $ 1,543,085 $ 1,417,157 $ 142,603 AMEVIVE 48,457 43,030 9,356 ZEVALIN 20,806 23,036 19,602 TYSABRI 4,656 3,121 Total product sales $ 1,617,004 $ 1,486,344 $ 171,561 AVONEX is the most prescribed therapeutic product in MS worldwide. Globally over 130,000 patients have chosen AVONEX as their treatment of choice. During 2005, sales of AVONEX generated worldwide revenues of $1.5 billion, of which $938.7 million was generated in the U.S. and $604.4 million was generated outside the U.S., primarily in the EU. Product sales from AVONEX represent approximately 64% of our total revenues in 2005. During 2004, sales of AVONEX generated worldwide revenues of $1.4 billion, of which $922.6 million was generated in the U.S. and $494.6 million was generated outside the U.S., primarily in the EU. Product sales from AVONEX represent approximately 64% of our total revenues in 2004. In the U.S., product sales from AVONEX increased primarily due to price increases, offset by lower volume of sales year over year. Outside the U.S., product sales increased primarily due to increased sales volume year over year. In 2003, sales of AVONEX generated worldwide revenues of $142.6 million, of which $92.6 million was generated in the U.S. and $50.0 million in the rest of the world, primarily the EU. Product sales from AVONEX represented approximately 21% of our total revenues in 2003. We expect to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace in and outside the U.S. from existing and new MS treatments, including TYSABRI if it is reintroduced to the market, which may impact sales of AVONEX. We expect future growth in AVONEX revenues to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully. AMEVIVE was approved in the U.S. in 2003 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. During 2005, sales of AMEVIVE generated revenues of $48.5 million, of which $34.9 million was generated in the U.S. and $13.6 million was generated outside of the U.S. Revenue outside of the U.S. increased primarily due to increased sales volume year over year, particularly in Canada, where AMEVIVE was approved for sale during 2004. During 2004, sales of AMEVIVE generated revenues of $43.0 million, substantially all in the U.S. In 2003, sales of AMEVIVE generated revenues of $9.4 million, substantially all in the U.S. Product sales from AMEVIVE represent approximately 2% of our total revenues in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and 1% in 2003. ZEVALIN as part of the ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen, is approved as a treatment for relapsed or refractory low grade, follicular, or transformed B cell NHL including patients with RITUXAN refractory follicular NHL. In 2005, sales of ZEVALIN generated revenues of $19.4 million in the U.S. as compared to $18.7 million in 2004. The 50 Table of Contents increase in product sales in the U.S. is attributable to higher sales volumes. Outside the U.S., we have licensed our marketing rights in ZEVALIN to Schering AG. In January 2004, the EMEA granted marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with CD20+ follicular B cell NHL who are refractory to or have relapsed following treatment with RITUXAN. Rest of world product sales for ZEVALIN for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.4 million compared to $4.3 million in 2004. The $4.3 million relates to ZEVALIN sold to Schering AG in 2003 and 2004, recognition of which had been deferred. The revenue was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2004, when an amendment to the license agreement was executed and the price of ZEVALIN became determinable. Product sales from ZEVALIN represented less than 1%, 1%, and 3% of our total revenues in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In November 2004, TYSABRI was approved by the FDA as treatment for relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. In the U.S., prior to the suspension, we sold TYSABRI to Elan who then distributed TYSABRI to third party distributors and other customers. In 2005, our revenue associated with sales of TYSABRI was $4.7 million, which consists of revenue from sales which occurred prior to our voluntary suspension. Sales from TYSABRI represent less than 1% of our total revenues in 2005. In 2004, our revenue associated with sales of TYSABRI was $3.1 million, which represents less than 1% of our total revenues in 2004. The voluntary suspension did not affect 2004 revenue. Also included as a reduction of TYSABRI revenue is $0.8 million of amortization related to approval and credit milestones. The approval and credit milestones were capitalized upon approval of TYSABRI in investments and other assets, and are being amortized over the remaining patent life of approximately 15 years. See also Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable under Critical Accounting Estimates for our method of recording revenue from TYSABRI sales. Additionally, as of March 31, 2005, we deferred $14.0 million in revenue under our revenue recognition policy with Elan, which has been fully paid by Elan, related to sales of TYSABRI which had not yet been shipped by Elan and remains deferred at December 31, 2005. In July 2005, Elan agreed that we would not share the cost of this inventory if it were ultimately deemed non saleable. See also the risks affecting revenues described in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Revenues Rely Significantly on a Limited Number of Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenue RITUXAN is currently marketed and sold worldwide for the treatment of certain B cell NHLs. In February 2006, RITUXAN was approved by the FDA to treat previously untreated patients with diffuse, large B cell NHL in combination with anthracycline based chemotherapy regimens. In addition, in February 2006, the FDA approved the sBLA for use of RITUXAN, in combination with methotrexate, for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with Genentech under a collaboration agreement between the parties. Under the collaboration agreement, we granted Genentech a worldwide license to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in multiple indications. In exchange for these worldwide rights, we have copromotion rights in the U.S. and a contractual arrangement under which Genentech shares a portion of the pretax U.S. copromotion profits of RITUXAN with us. This collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement, not through a joint venture or other legal entity. In June 2003, we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with Genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti CD20 antibodies targeting B cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of indications. In the U.S., we contribute resources to selling and the continued development of RITUXAN. Genentech is responsible for worldwide manufacturing of RITUXAN. Genentech also is responsible for the primary support functions for the commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. including selling and marketing, customer service, order entry, distribution, shipping and billing. Genentech also incurs the majority of continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Under the arrangement, we have a limited sales force as well as limited development activity. 51 Table of Contents Under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between Genentech and Roche, commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where Roche copromotes RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku. There is no direct contractual arrangement between us and Roche or Zenyaku. Revenue from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of pretax copromotion profits which is calculated by Genentech, and includes consideration of our RITUXAN related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenue from sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Copromotion profit consists of U.S. sales of RITUXAN to third party customers net of discounts and allowances and less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses, and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula, which resets annually, is as follows: Biogen Idecs Share Copromotion Operating Profits of Copromotion Profits First $50 million 30 % Greater than $50 million 40 % In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the 40% threshold was met during the first quarter. For each calendar year or portion thereof following the approval date of the first new anti CD20 product, the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and other anti CD20 products sold by us and Genentech will change to the following: New Anti CD20 U.S. Biogen Idecs Share Copromotion Operating Profits Gross Product Sales of Copromotion Profits First $50 million(1) N/A 30% Greater than $50 million Until such sales exceed $150 million in any calendar year (2) 38% Or After such sales exceed $150 million in any calendar year and until such sales exceed $350 million in any calendar year (3) 35% Or After such sales exceed $350 million in any calendar year (4) 30% (1) not applicable in the calendar year the first new anti CD20 product is approved if $50 million in copromotion operating profits has already been achieved in such calendar year through sales of RITUXAN. (2) if we are recording our share of RITUXAN copromotion profits at 40%, upon the approval date of the first new anti CD20 product, our share of copromotion profits for RITUXAN and the new anti CD20 product will be immediately reduced to 38% following the approval date of the first new anti CD20 product until the $150 million new product sales level is achieved. (3) if $150 million in new product sales is achieved in the same calendar year the first new anti CD20 product receives approval, then the 35% copromotion profit sharing rate will not be effective until January 1 of the following calendar year. Once the $150 million new product sales level is achieved then our share of copromotion profits for the balance of the year and all subsequent years (after the first $50 million in copromotion operating profits in such years) will be 35% until the $350 million new product sales level is achieved. (4) if $350 million in new product sales is achieved in the same calendar year that $150 million in new product sales is achieved, then the 30% copromotion profit sharing rate will not be effective until January 1 of the following calendar year (or January 1 of the second following calendar year if the first new anti CD20 product receives approval and, in the same calendar year, the $150 million and $350 million new product sales levels are achieved). Once the $350 million new product sales level is achieved then our share of copromotion profits for the balance of the year and all subsequent years will be 30%. 52 Table of Contents Copromotion profits for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, consist of the following (table in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Product revenues, net $ 1,831,528 $ 1,573,228 $ 1,360,537 Costs and expenses 516,016 418,190 299,398 Copromotion profits $ 1,315,512 $ 1,155,038 $ 1,061,139 Biogen Idecs share of copromotion profits $ 513,774 $ 457,025 $ 419,197 Net sales of RITUXAN to third party customers in the U.S. recorded by Genentech for 2005 were $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2003. The increase in 2005 from 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of B cell NHLs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and increases in the wholesale price of RITUXAN effective October and July 2005 and September 2004. We received royalties on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. of $147.5 million in 2005 as compared to $121.0 million in 2004 and $67.9 million in 2003, which we include under Revenue from unconsolidated joint business in our consolidated statements of income. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, consist of the following (table in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Copromotion profits $ 513,774 $ 457,025 $ 419,197 Reimbursement of selling and development expenses 47,593 37,710 18,400 Royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. 147,514 121,008 67,869 RITUXAN clinical data purchased from Roche (9,353 ) Columbia patent royalty and interest payment (3,064 ) $ 708,881 $ 615,743 $ 493,049 Our royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is based on Roche and Zenyakus net sales to third party customers and is recorded on a cash basis. The increase in royalty revenues in 2005 and 2004 is due to increased sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S, which is offset by an $11.3 million royalty credit to Genentech in 2005, which we expect to pay in 2006. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of new anti CD20 products, as compared to royalty revenue received on sales of RITUXAN. The royalty period with respect to all products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis. During 2003, Genentech purchased certain clinical data from Roche that supported a potential label expansion of RITUXAN. Additionally, in 2003, we, along with Genentech, agreed that payments were owed to Columbia University for royalties related to past sales of RITUXAN in the U.S. As a result, we recognized $2.6 million in royalty payments and $0.5 million in interest charges related to these royalties. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business represented 29%, 28% and 73% of our total revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to former Biogen, Inc. revenue included in our results of operations for all of 2004 and for the period of November 12, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Royalty Revenue We receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control. Royalty revenues totaled $93.2 million in 2005 compared to $98.9 million in 2004 and $12.0 million in 2003. Royalty revenues represented 4% of total revenues in 2005 and 2004 and 2% of total revenues in 2003. Our 53 Table of Contents royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. are included in Revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We receive royalties from Schering Plough Corporation, or Schering Plough, on sales of its alpha interferon products in the U.S. and Italy under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon patents and patent applications. Schering Plough sells its INTRON A (interferon alfa 2b) brand of alpha interferon in the U.S. for a number of indications, including the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Schering Plough also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of hepatitis C, including REBETRON Combination Therapy containing INTRON A and REBETOL (ribavirin, USP), PEG INTRON (peginterferon alfa 2b), a pegylated form of alpha interferon, and PEG INTRON in combination with REBETOL. We hold several important patents related to hepatitis B antigens produced by genetic engineering techniques. These antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis B infection. We receive royalties from sales of hepatitis B vaccines in several countries, including the U.S., from GlaxoSmithKline plc and Merck and Co. Inc. We have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis B rights, on an antigen by antigen and nonexclusive basis, to several diagnostic kit manufacturers, including Abbott Laboratories, the major worldwide marketer of hepatitis B diagnostic kits. We also receive ongoing royalties on sales of ANGIOMAX (bivalirudin) by The Medicines Company, or TMC. TMC sells ANGIOMAX in the U.S. for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. TMC sells ANGIOMAX through distributors in Europe, Canada and Latin America. We anticipate that total royalty revenues in 2006 will be consistent with our total royalty revenues in 2005. Royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs. Corporate Partner Revenues Corporate partner revenues consist of contract revenues and license fees. Corporate partner revenues totaled $3.4 million in 2005 compared to $10.5 million in 2004 and $2.6 million in 2003. Corporate partner revenues represented less than 1% of total revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003. In 2004, we received a $10.0 million payment from Schering AG for the EMEA grant of marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU. The payment represented, in part, a milestone payment to compensate us for preparing, generating, and collecting data that was critical to the EMEA marketing approval process and, to which we have no continuing involvement. Operating Costs and Expenses 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Cost of product and royalty revenues $ 373,614 $ 554,319 $ 284,739 Research and development 747,671 685,872 233,337 Selling, general and administrative 644,758 580,278 174,596 Acquired in process research and development 823,000 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 302,305 347,677 33,180 Facility impairments and loss on sale 118,112 Total operating costs and expenses $ 2,186,460 $ 2,168,146 $ 1,548,852 Cost of Product and Royalty Revenues In 2005, total cost of product and royalty revenues was $373.6 million and consisted of product cost of revenues of $369.2 million and cost of royalty revenues of $4.4 million. Product cost of revenues consisted of $228.5 million related to AVONEX, $94.0 million related to AMEVIVE, $23.9 million related to TYSABRI and $22.8 million related to ZEVALIN. Approximately $66.0 million in cost of product revenues represents the 54 Table of Contents difference between the cost of AMEVIVE inventory recorded at the Merger date and its historical manufacturing cost, which was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down in 2005. Of the $66.0 million of cost of product revenues related to AMEVIVE, approximately $31.8 million represents the write down of AMEVIVE to its estimated net realizable value at December 31, 2005. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. In addition, we suspended dosing in clinical studies of TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease and RA. These decisions were based on reports of cases of PML, a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies. We and Elan conducted a safety evaluation of patients treated with TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease and RA clinical studies. The safety evaluation included the review of any reports of potential PML in MS patients receiving TYSABRI in the commercial setting. In October 2005, we completed the safety evaluation and found no new confirmed cases of PML. Three confirmed cases of PML were previously reported, two of which were fatal. In September 2005, we submitted an sBLA for TYSABRI to the FDA for the treatment of MS. In November 2005, we were granted Priority Review status for the sBLA, which will result in action by the FDA approximately six months from the submission date, or by March 2006. In January 2006, we and Elan announced that we had received notification from the FDA that the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee would review TYSABRI for the treatment of MS on March 7, 2006. We and Elan have also submitted a similar data package to the EMEA. This information was supplied as part of the ongoing EMEA review process, which was initiated in the summer of 2004 with the filing for approval of TYSABRI as a treatment for MS. In February 2006, we and Elan announced that the FDA informed the companies that they removed the hold on clinical trial dosing of TYSABRI. We and Elan expect to begin an open label, multi center safety extension study of TYSABRI monotherapy in the U.S. and internationally in the coming weeks. We plan to work with regulatory authorities to determine if dosing in MS and other clinical studies will be re initiated and the future commercial availability of the product. We cannot predict the outcome of our work with regulatory authorities. TYSABRI could be permanently withdrawn from the market or re introduced to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses, black box or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions, requirements and limitations as the FDA, EMEA or other regulatory authorities may require. While we presently believe that we will be able to find a path forward for TYSABRI, there are no assurances as to the likelihood of success. In light of our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that our TYSABRI inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we wrote down all of the $19.1 million of TYSABRI inventory that had been included on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2004, which was charged to cost of product revenues. We manufactured TYSABRI during the first and second quarter of 2005 and completed our scheduled production of TYSABRI during July 2005. Because of the uncertain future commercial availability of TYSABRI and our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that TYSABRI inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we expensed $23.2 million of costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI in the first quarter of 2005 to cost of product revenues. At the time of production, the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable. Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, as we were working with clinical investigators to understand the possible risks of PML, we charged the costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense. As a result, we expensed $21.5 million related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense during 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, in light of our expectation that we will reintroduce of TYSABRI to the U.S. market, we began a new manufacturing campaign for TYSABRI. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect Our Growth. We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. This periodic review led to the write downs of TYSABRI inventory as of December 31, 2004 and the expensing of TYSABRI during 2005, as described above, and may lead us to expense TYSABRI in subsequent periods. 55 Table of Contents Our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration, in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value. In 2005, we wrote down $30.3 million, $12.0 million and $10.1 million of unmarketable inventory related to AMEVIVE, AVONEX and ZEVALIN, respectively, which was charged to cost of product revenues. The write downs of AMEVIVE inventory consisted of $10.0 million of expired product and $20.3 million for product that failed to meet quality specifications. The write downs of AVONEX inventory consisted of $8.4 million for remaining supplies of the alternative presentations of AVONEX that were no longer needed after the FDA approved a new component for the pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX in March 2005, $2.8 million for product that failed to meet quality specifications and $0.8 million of expired product. The ZEVALIN inventory was written down when it was determined that it would not be marketable based on estimates of demand. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of $5.7 million to cost of product revenues related to an impairment of certain capitalized ZEVALIN patents, to reflect the adjustment to net realizable value. As part of our comprehensive strategic plan, we are seeking to divest AMEVIVE. We have evaluated our AMEVIVE inventory based on third party contract negotiations and determined its expected net realizable value. As a result, we recorded charges of $31.8 million to cost of product revenues in 2005 to write down AMEVIVE to its net realizable value at December 31, 2005. In addition, our AMEVIVE inventory balance at December 31, 2005 was $49.8 million, of which $24.8 million related to the historical manufacturing costs and $25.0 million related to the increase in fair market value of inventory acquired at the Merger. In 2004, total cost of product and royalty revenues was $554.3 million and consisted of product cost of revenues of $548.7 million and cost of royalty revenues of $5.6 million. Product cost of revenues consisted of $480.0 million related to AVONEX, $27.8 million related to AMEVIVE, $19.0 million related to ZEVALIN and $17.3 million related to TYSABRI. Approximately $295.1 million in cost of product revenues represents the difference between the cost of AVONEX and AMEVIVE inventory recorded at the Merger date and its historical manufacturing cost, which was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down in 2004. All AVONEX inventory acquired in the Merger was sold or written off as of December 31, 2004. We wrote down $46.7 million of unmarketable inventory during 2004, which was charged to cost of product revenues and consisted of $16.2 million related to AVONEX, $9.7 million related to ZEVALIN, $1.7 million related to AMEVIVE and $19.1 million related to TYSABRI. The AVONEX and AMEVIVE inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications. The ZEVALIN inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications or when it was determined that the inventory would not be marketable based on estimates of demand. In 2003, cost of product revenues consisted of $254.3 million related to AVONEX, $18.7 million related to ZEVALIN and $8.7 million related to AMEVIVE, of which $231.6 million represents the difference between the cost of inventory recorded at the acquisition date and its historical manufacturing cost for AVONEX and AMEVIVE. In 2003, we wrote down $160.8 million related to AVONEX, $1.0 million related to AMEVIVE and $12.1 million related to ZEVALIN. Of the $160.8 million write down related to AVONEX, $149.6 million represented the increase to fair market value of inventory acquired at the Merger and $11.2 million represented the historical manufacturing costs. Non GAAP gross margin on product revenues, which includes inventory written down to its net realizable value, was approximately 77%, 63%, and (65)% in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The large fluctuation of gross margin on product revenues is due primarily to inventory acquired from Biogen, Inc. through the Merger. During 2003, we recorded the inventory that we acquired from Biogen, Inc. at its estimated fair value. The increase in the inventorys basis to fair market value was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down. During the first half of 2004, we sold or wrote down all remaining AVONEX inventory acquired through the Merger. As a result, gross margin on product sales increased significantly during 2005. Excluding the increase in fair market value related to purchase accounting, the effect of write downs of commercial 56 Table of Contents inventory to net realizable value, and costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI that were included in cost of product revenues, non GAAP pro forma gross margins of product revenues were 85%, 86%, and 84% in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. We expect that gross margins will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product mix, write downs of excess or obsolete inventories and new product initiatives. Gross margin on royalty revenues were approximately 95%, 94%, and 92% in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. We expect that gross margins on royalty revenues will fluctuate in the future based on changes in sales volumes for specific products from which we receive royalties. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses totaled $747.7 million in 2005 compared to $685.9 million in 2004 and $233.3 million in 2003. The increase of $61.8 million in research and development expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily related to an upfront licensing fee and accrued milestones of $50.0 million related to a collaboration with PDL BioPharma, Inc., formerly known as Protein Design Labs, Inc., or PDL; $11.1 million related to biopharmaceutical operations and global quality initiatives for our manufacturing activities, which includes expenses related to the manufacture of TYSABRI; $16.7 million related to increased depreciation and infrastructure expenses; $7.1 million for discovery research initiatives; and $9.4 million related to increased pre clinical research activities. These increases in research and development expenses were offset by a decrease of $31.4 million of expenses related to our ongoing clinical trials, primarily related to lower than expected clinical trial expenses for TYSABRI and AMEVIVE. The increase in research and development expenses in 2004 over 2003 primarily related to a full year of the former Biogen, Inc. expenses in 2004 compared to the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. The increase related to the former Biogen, Inc. was $432.8 million and consisted primarily of $74.3 million of expenses related to pre clinical research activities, $144.0 million of development research activities, including clinical trials, related to TYSABRI and AMEVIVE, $84.2 million of biopharmaceutical operations expenses mainly attributable to manufacturing and supply chain functions, $96.1 million of increased depreciation and infrastructure costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing and research facilities, and $17.5 million for our joint development collaboration agreements. We expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in 2006 for a number of reasons, including our plans to commit significant additional capital to external business development and research opportunities. We manufactured TYSABRI during the first and second quarter of 2005 and completed our scheduled production of TYSABRI during July 2005. At the time, because of the uncertain future commercial availability of TYSABRI and our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that TYSABRI inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we expensed $23.2 million related to the manufacture of TYSABRI in the first quarter of 2005 to cost of product revenues. At the time of production, the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable. Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, we charged the costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense. As a result, we expensed $21.5 million, related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense during 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, in light of expectations of re introduction of TYSABRI, we began a new manufacturing campaign. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $644.8 million in 2005 compared to $580.3 million in 2004 and $174.6 million in 2003. The increase of $64.5 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to $19.7 million for oncology sales and marketing initiatives primarily due to a charge of $12.9 million related to a write down of remaining prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with MDS (Canada), to its net realizable value; $8.0 million for neurology sales force expansion in the U.S.; $10.6 million for increased international neurology sales activities primarily in the EU; $7.2 million for customer service initiatives; partially offset by a decrease of $7.4 million related to our immunology sales and marketing programs largely due to the pending AMEVIVE divestiture. Included in the increase of selling, general and administrative fees for 2005 were approximately $15.7 million for administrative expenses, primarily related to 57 Table of Contents consulting fees and grants, $8.6 million for information technology primarily compensation and consulting costs, and $7.1 million of compensation and other costs associated with the retirement of our former Executive Chairman in December 2005. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily related to a full year of the former Biogen, Inc. expenses in 2004 compared to the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. The increase related to the former Biogen, Inc. was $410.1 million and consisted primarily of $192.9 million of expenses related to neurology and dermatology sales and marketing activities, primarily due to the launch of TYSABRI, $112.9 million of expenses related to our international selling, general and administrative initiatives, $64.2 million of expenses related to our finance and information technology infrastructure, and $34.6 million of expenses related to the expansion of our global medical affairs Phase IV initiatives. We anticipate that total selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2006 will be higher than 2005 due to sales and marketing and other general and administrative expenses to primarily support AVONEX and TYSABRI, and legal expenses related to lawsuits, investigations and other matters resulting from the suspension of TYSABRI. Severance and Other Costs from Restructuring Plan In September 2005, we began implementing a comprehensive strategic plan designed to position us for long term growth. In conjunction with the plan, we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management layers and staff functions, resulting in the reduction of our workforce by approximately 17%, or approximately 650 positions worldwide. These adjustments took place across Company functions, departments and sites, and were substantially implemented by the end of 2005. We have recorded restructuring charges associated with these activities, which consist primarily of severance and other employee termination costs, including health benefits, outplacement and bonuses. Other costs include write downs of certain research assets that will no longer be utilized, consulting costs in connection with the restructuring effort and costs related to the acceleration of restricted stock, offset by the reversal of previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted stock cancellations. For the year ended December 31, 2005, $20.0 million of restructuring charges are included in research and development expenses, and $11.4 million are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. These remaining unpaid costs at December 31, 2005 are included in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet. The components of the charges are as follows (table in thousands): Costs incurred Paid/Settled through Remaining liability at during 2005 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2005 Severance and employee termination costs incurred $ 28,287 $ (10,861 ) $ 17,426 Other costs 3,118 (3,087 ) 31 $ 31,405 $ (13,948 ) $ 17,457 We may have additional charges in future periods related to the plan. The amount of those charges cannot be determined at this time. On December 16, 2005, William H. Rastetter, our former Executive Chairman, entered into a letter agreement confirming Dr. Rastetters retirement as Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board and his resignation from the Board, all effective as of December 30, 2005. As a result, Dr. Rastetter was entitled to, among other things, payments equal to his 2005 target bonus and three times the sum of his annual salary and target bonus, immediate vesting of his unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. These charges related to Dr. Rastetters retirement amounted to $7.1 million, and no liability related to Dr. Rastetters retirement remained as of December 31, 2005. In 2004, we recorded charges of $4.4 million related to severance obligations for certain employees affected by the Merger in our San Diego facilities, and $2.3 million of restructuring costs related to the relocation of our European headquarters. In 2003, we accrued $2.1 million of restructuring costs related to severance obligations for certain employees affected by the Merger in our Cambridge facilities, and accrued an additional $1.0 million of 58 Table of Contents charges in 2004. At December 31, 2005, we have no significant remaining liabilities related to the 2003 and 2004 obligations. Facility Impairments and Loss on Sale In the third and fourth quarters of 2005, in connection with our comprehensive strategic plan, we recorded an impairment charge of $28.0 million to facility impairments and loss on sale, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of our NICO clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, and classified the asset as held for sale under SFAS 144. On June 23, 2005, Genentech purchased our large scale biologics manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known as NIMO, along with approximately 60 acres of real property located in Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is located, together with improvements, related property rights, and certain personal property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real property. Through the first quarter of 2005, we intended to hold and continue using the facility. In June 2005, we determined instead to accept an offer from Genentech to purchase the facility. Total consideration for the purchase was $408.1 million. The loss from this transaction was $83.5 million, which consisted primarily of the write down of NIMO to its net selling price, sales and transfer taxes, and other associated transaction costs. As of March 31, 2005, after our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod. Additionally, we added a labeling and packaging component to the project. We also determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of our large scale biological manufacturing facility in Hillerod. As a result, in the first quarter of 2005, we wrote off $6.2 million to facility impairments and loss on sale expense of engineering costs related to the fill finish component that had previously been capitalized. Other Income (Expense), Net December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Interest income $ 62,751 $ 57,225 $ 33,610 Interest expense (9,647 ) (18,898 ) (15,182 ) Other expense (32,949 ) (17,650 ) (29,383 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 20,155 $ 20,677 $ (10,955 ) Interest income totaled $62.8 million in 2005 compared to $57.2 million in 2004 and $33.6 million in 2003. The increase in interest income in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily due to higher yields on our marketable securities portfolio. The increase in interest income in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily due to higher cash levels, primarily related to cash levels contributed by former Biogen, Inc., and higher yields on our marketable securities portfolio. Interest expense totaled $9.6 million in 2005 compared to $18.9 million in 2004 and $15.2 million in 2003. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 compared to 2004 is a result of the repurchase of our senior notes due in 2032 in the second quarter for 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2004 compared to 2003 related to an updated estimation of the life of our senior notes due in 2032. In 2004, amortization of the issuance costs related to the senior notes increased $7.1 million. This was offset by lower noncash interest expense due to conversions throughout 2004 of our subordinated notes due in 2019, and higher capitalized interest expense in 2004. 59 Table of Contents Other expense as set forth in the preceding table included the following (table in thousands): December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Impairments of marketable securities and investments $ (18,502 ) $ (18,482 ) $ Foreign exchange gains (losses) (8,695 ) 5,353 1,319 Loss on sale of marketable securities available for sale (5,333 ) (4,090 ) Gain on investments in executive deferred compensation plan 460 1,029 Gain (loss) on hedge ineffectiveness and discontinuance 1,291 (936 ) Repayment of loan previously written off 2,500 Settlement of litigation (2,113 ) Loan impairment (2,301 ) Donation to Biogen Idec Foundation (10,000 ) Settlement of patent disputes (20,668 ) Miscellaneous (256 ) (524 ) (34 ) Total other expense $ (32,949 ) $ (17,650 ) $ (29,383 ) In December 2003, we contributed $10.0 million to the Biogen Idec Foundation. The foundation is to operate exclusively for the benefit of funding charitable, educational and scientific purposes. Certain directors, executive officers and other employees serve as directors and officers of the foundation. We classify charitable contributions to other expense. In December 2003, we recorded charges of $2.5 million and $18.2 million related to the final settlement of patent infringement disputes with Apoxis S.A. and Corixa Corporation, respectively. These payments were charged to other expense in the fourth quarter of 2003. Acquired In Process Research and Development In the fourth quarter of 2003, we incurred a charge of $823.0 million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D, related to the Merger. The amount expensed as IPR&D represents the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model. For each project, the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 16%. As of December 31, 2005, we estimated future research and development expenses of approximately $66 million and $20 million would be incurred to complete the purchased neurology and rheumatology research projects, respectively. Since November 12, 2003, the date of the Merger, we have discontinued certain clinical trials. Estimates of expenses are net of any research and development expenses that were shared under collaborations with corporate partners. The projects, which were in various stages of development, from preclinical through Phase III clinical trials, are, unless they have been discontinued, expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 2006 through 2010. Additionally, in connection with the voluntary suspension of marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI in February 2005, we suspended dosing in clinical trials of TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease and RA. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects are that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. 60 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangible Assets We recorded amortization expense of $302.3 million in 2005 compared to $347.7 million in 2004 and $33.2 million in 2003 related to the intangible assets of $3.7 billion acquired in the Merger. The decrease in 2005 largely relates to a change in estimate in the calculation of economic consumption for core technology, offset by a $7.9 million charge to write down certain core technology intangible assets to net realizable value in 2005. Intangible assets consist of $3.0 billion in core technology, $578.0 million in patents and $64.0 million in trademarks. Amortization of the core technology is provided over the estimated useful lives of the technology ranging from 15 to 20 years, based on the greater of straight line or economic consumption. Amortization of the out licensed patents for which we receive royalties is provided over the remaining lives of the patents of 10 years. Trademarks have an indefinite life and, as such, are not amortized. In the third quarter of 2005, we completed a review of our business opportunities in each of the relevant commercial markets in which our products are sold and determined their expected profitability. As a result of this review, in the third quarter of 2005, management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain technology intangible assets related to future sales of AVONEX in Japan may not be recoverable. As a result, we recorded a charge of approximately $7.9 million to amortization of acquired intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of technology intangible assets related to AVONEX. As part of our decision to divest our AMEVIVE product, we have reassessed our remaining intangible assets related to AMEVIVE, and have determined that there are no impairments related to these assets as a result of our decision to divest AMEVIVE. However, should new information arise, we may be required to take impairment charges related to certain of our intangibles. In the third quarter of 2004, management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE may not be recoverable. As a result, in the third quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $27.8 million to amortization of acquired intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE. We review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations. Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate in 2005 was approximately 37.27% compared to 60.86% in 2004 and 0.63% in 2003. Our effective tax rate for 2005 varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the acquisition related intangible amortization arising from purchase accounting related to foreign jurisdictions and a one time tax charge related to the repatriation of a portion of the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiary offset, in part, by the effect of lower income tax rates (less than 35% U.S. statutory corporate rate) in certain non U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate, tax credits allowed for research and experimentation expenses in the U.S., and the new domestic manufacturing deduction. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, our 2005 non GAAP effective tax rate would have been approximately 29%. Our effective tax rate for 2004 varied substantially from the U.S. federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the acquisition related intangible amortization and inventory fair value adjustments arising from purchase accounting related to foreign jurisdictions offset, in part, by the effect of lower income tax rates (less than the 35% U.S. statutory corporate rate) in certain non U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate and tax credits allowed for research and experimentation expenditures in the U.S. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, our 2004 non GAAP effective tax rate would have been approximately 32%. Our effective tax rate for 2003 varied substantially from the U.S. federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the pre tax loss resulting from the write off of non deductible IPR&D and other costs in connection with the Merger with Biogen, Inc. which were not deductible for income tax purposes. Excluding the effect of our write off of IPR&D, our 2003 non GAAP effective tax rate would have been approximately 35%. We have tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income. The utilization of our tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the Internal Revenue Code due to a 61 Table of Contents cumulative change of ownership of more than 50% in prior years. However, we anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net tax credits. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax liabilities and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are either tax deductible or to which our tax credits may be carried, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the entire benefits of our deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Act, was signed into law. The Act created a temporary incentive, which expired on December 31, 2005, for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. at an effective tax rate that could be as low as 5.25%. On December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB staff position 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or FSP 109 2. FSP 109 2 allowed companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the law on whether unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to qualify for SFAS 109s exception to recognizing deferred tax liabilities. We completed our evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2005 and decided to take advantage of this temporary tax incentive. A total distribution of $196 million was made by one of our foreign subsidiaries to one of our U.S. subsidiaries in December 2005. We incurred a charge to our consolidated results of operations of approximately $11.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 for the tax cost related to the distribution. The Act also provides a deduction for domestic manufacturing, which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 1.3% for the current year. We estimate that the deduction will reduce our effective tax rate by a higher amount in future years, as the deduction is fully phased in. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its exam of legacy Biogen, Inc.s, now Biogen Idec MA, Inc.s, consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and issued an assessment. We subsequently paid the majority of the amounts assessed and are appealing one issue. As a result of this and other income tax audit activity, Biogen Idec MA, Inc. reassessed its liability for income tax contingencies to reflect the IRS findings and recorded a $13.8 million reduction in these liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2005. The corresponding effects of the adjustments to the liability for income tax contingencies through 2004 resulted in a reduction in goodwill of $20.7 million for amounts related to periods prior to the acquisition by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and an increase in income tax expense associated with continuing operations of $6.9 million. Financial Condition We have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through profits and other revenues from our joint business arrangement with Genentech related to the sale of RITUXAN, sales of AVONEX, AMEVIVE, and ZEVALIN, royalty revenues, corporate partner revenues, debt financing transactions and interest income. We expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand, which includes funds from our joint business arrangement with Genentech related to the sale of RITUXAN, commercial sales of AVONEX and ZEVALIN, royalties and existing collaborative agreements and contracts, and sales of TYSABRI if we are able to re launch this product. We believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we may, from time to time, seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. Our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including: the continued commercial success of AVONEX and RITUXAN and, to a lesser extent, ZEVALIN; the future commercial availability of TYSABRI if we are able to re launch this product; the timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development; the cost of launching new products, and the success of those products; funding and timing of payments related to several significant capital projects, the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing; fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs; levels of resources that we need to devote to the development of manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities, including resources devoted to the marketing of AVONEX, RITUXAN, ZEVALIN and future products, as well as the future marketing and manufacturing of TYSABRI if we are able to re launch this product; technological advances; status of products being developed by competitors; our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations; and working capital required to satisfy the options of holders of our 62 Table of Contents subordinated notes who may require us to repurchase their notes on specified terms or upon the occurrence of specified events. In connection with the strategic plan that we announced in September 2005, we intend to commit significant additional capital to external research and development opportunities. Until required for operations, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, foreign and U.S. government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale decreased to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2005 from $2.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Our operating activities generated $889.5 million of cash for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $728.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating activities: The increase in cash provided by operations during the year ended December 31, 2005 is primarily attributable to higher cash receipts from our customers and partners driven largely from growth in product sales and from our unconsolidated joint business arrangement. Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005, includes our net income of $160.7 million. Operating cash flows differ from net income as a result of non cash charges or differences in the timing of cash flows and earnings recognition. Noncash charges of $402.2 million for depreciation and amortization, $118.1 million related to the loss on sale of our NIMO manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California and write down of our NICO manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California to fair value, $19.2 million of interest expense and amortization of interest premium, $84.0 million related to the write down of inventory to net realizable value, $16.9 million of impact on sales of stepped up inventory, $25.4 million of tax benefits related to stock options and $33.7 million for the impairment of other investments and other long lived assets, offset by $115.5 million for deferred income taxes. Investing activities: Our investing activities provided $417.7 million of cash in 2005 compared to utilizing $382.4 million of cash in 2004. Cash generated from investing activities consisted of $408.1 million of proceeds from the sale of our Oceanside, California manufacturing facility to Genentech on June 23, 2005, previously discussed in our results of operations. Additionally, approximately $447.9 million of net cash was provided from proceeds from sales of available for sale securities. We sold marketable securities in the second quarter of 2005 to fund the repurchase of our senior notes, discussed below. Cash used for investing activities consisted of $318.4 million to fund construction projects and purchase real property and equipment, including our research and development and administration campus in San Diego and manufacturing facility in Oceanside, and $119.9 million for investments in marketable securities of PDL, Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sunesis, and other strategic investments. Financing activities: Cash generated from financing activities included $119.6 million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans for stock based compensation arrangements during 2005, and $10.5 million of loan proceeds to a joint venture that we consolidate. Cash outflows from financing activities included $746.4 million for the repurchase of our senior notes, discussed in detail below, $322.6 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program, and $9.6 million related to the change in our cash overdraft. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuation in the market value of our stock relative to the price of the options. In April and May 2002, we raised through the issuance of our senior notes, approximately $696 million, net of underwriting commissions and expenses of $18.4 million. The senior notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of 1.75% annually. On April 29, 2005, holders of 99.2% of the outstanding senior notes exercised their right under the indenture governing the senior notes to require us to repurchase their senior notes. On May 2, 2005, we paid $746.4 million in cash to repurchase those senior notes with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately $1.2 billion. The purchase price for the senior notes was $624.73 in cash per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, and was based on the requirements of the indenture and the senior notes. Additionally, we made a cash payment in 2005 of approximately $62 million for the payment of tax related to additional deductible interest expense for which deferred tax liabilities had been previously established. As of December 31, 2005, our remaining indebtedness under the senior notes was approximately $10.2 million at maturity. In February 1999, we raised through the issuance of our subordinated notes, approximately $112.7 million, net of underwriting commissions and expenses of $3.9 million. The subordinated notes are zero coupon and were priced 63 Table of Contents with a yield to maturity of 5.5% annually. Upon maturity, the subordinated notes would have had an aggregate principal face value of $345.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, our remaining indebtedness under the subordinated notes was approximately $75.4 million at maturity, due to conversion of subordinated notes into common stock. Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value subordinated note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into 40.404 shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $8.36 per share. During 2005, holders of the subordinated notes with a face value of approximately $143.8 million elected to convert their subordinated notes to approximately 5.8 million shares of our common stock. The remaining holders of the subordinated notes may require us to purchase the subordinated notes on February 16, 2009 or 2014 at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase with us having the option to repay the subordinated notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock. We have the right to redeem at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption all or a portion of the subordinated notes for cash at any time. In August 2004, we restarted construction of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark. As of March 31, 2005, after our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod. Additionally, we added a labeling and packaging component to the project. We also determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of our large scale biological manufacturing facility in Hillerod. The original cost of the project was expected to be $372.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had committed approximately $215.0 million to the project, of which $148.4 million has been paid. We expect the label and packaging facility to be substantially complete in 2006 and licensed for operation in 2007. The timing of the completion and anticipated licensing of the Hillerod facility is in part dependent upon the commercial availability and potential market acceptance of TYSABRI. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. If TYSABRI were permanently withdrawn from the market, we would need to evaluate our long term plan for this facility. If we are able to reintroduce TYSABRI to the market, we would need to evaluate our requirements for TYSABRI inventory and additional manufacturing capacity in light of the approved label and our judgment of the potential U.S. market acceptance of TYSABRI in MS, the probability of obtaining marketing approval of TYSABRI in MS in the EU and other jurisdictions, and the probability of obtaining marketing approval of TYSABRI in additional indications in the U.S., EU and other jurisdictions. In June 2004, we commenced construction to add additional research facilities and administrative space to one of our existing buildings in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The cost of the project is estimated to be $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had committed approximately $72.2 million to the project, of which $63.1 million had been paid. The project was substantially complete in November 2005 and we occupied the new facility in December 2005. In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as common stock to be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase plans. This repurchase program will expire no later than October 4, 2006. During 2005, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of $322.6 million. Approximately 11.9 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this program at December 31, 2005. In connection with the Merger, we assumed Biogen, Inc.s Retirement Plan, a tax qualified defined benefit pension plan. Prior to November 13, 2003, we did not have a pension plan. At October 31, 2003, Biogen, Inc. ceased allowing new participants into the plans. Effective December 31, 2003, Biogen, Inc. amended the plans so that no further benefits would accrue to participants. During 2004, we incurred charges of approximately $2.1 million related to transition benefits associated with the termination of the plans, and plan curtailment costs and additional premium costs related to the annuity transfer of approximately $3.0 million, which are included in our results of operations for 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had a liability of $0.3 million related to these plans. As of December 31, 2005, we had fulfilled our pension obligations, and all assets had been fully disbursed. 64 Table of Contents Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures We use non GAAP gross margin of product sales measure in the Cost of Product Revenues section and non GAAP effective tax rate measures in the Income Tax Provision section. These are non GAAP financial measures. The most direct comparable GAAP financial measures of each non GAAP financial measure as well as the reconciliation between each non GAAP financial measure and the GAAP financial measure are presented in the discussions of the non GAAP financial measures. We believe that the non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors. In particular, we believe that the non GAAP financial measures allow investors to monitor and evaluate our ongoing operating results and trends and gain a better understanding of our past performance as well as period to period performance. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding contingent milestone payments totaling $1.2 billion under our collaboration and license agreements, and construction commitments disclosed separately under Financial Condition) at December 31, 2005, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 3 4 5 After Years 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In thousands) Non cancelable operating leases $ 129,644 $ 30,528 $ 47,043 $ 23,929 $ 28,144 Other long term obligations 43,329 17,056 18,723 7,550 Total contractual cash obligations $ 172,973 $ 47,584 $ 65,766 $ 31,479 $ 28,144 All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We do not have any other significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Additionally, holders of our subordinated notes may elect to convert their notes into shares of our common stock at any time. Collaboration and License Agreements In connection with our research and development efforts, we have entered into various collaboration arrangements which provide us with rights to develop, produce and market products using certain know how, technology and patent rights maintained by the parties. Terms of the various license agreements may require us to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product development objectives and pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. In August 2005, we entered in a collaborative agreement with PDL for the joint development, manufacture and commercialization of three Phase II antibody products. Under this agreement, Biogen Idec and PDL will share in the development and commercialization of daclizumab in MS and indications other than transplant and respiratory diseases, and the development and commercialization of M200 (volociximab) and HuZAFtm (fontolizumab) in all indications. Both companies will share equally the costs of all development activities and all operating profits from each collaboration product within the U.S. and Europe. We paid PDL a non refundable upfront licensing fee of $40.0 million, which we concluded had no alternative future uses and is therefore included in research and development expenses in 2005. We also accrued $10.0 million in research and development expense in 2005 for future payments that were determined to be unavoidable. In addition, we purchased approximately $100.0 million of common stock, or 3.6% of shares outstanding, from PDL, which is included at its fair value of $115.4 million in investments and other assets at December 31, 2005, which is being accounted for under FAS 115. Terms of the collaborative agreement require us to make certain development and commercialization milestone payments upon the achievement of certain program objectives totaling up to $660.0 million over the life of the agreement, of which $560.0 million relates to development and $100.0 million relates to the commercialization of collaboration products. 65 Table of Contents In August 2004, we entered into a collaborative agreement with Sunesis to discover and develop small molecule cancer therapeutics targeting primarily kinases. Under the agreement, we acquired exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize certain compounds resulting from the collaboration. Upon signing the agreement, we paid Sunesis a non refundable upfront license fee of $7.0 million, which was recorded in research and development expenses in 2004. Under the terms of this agreement, we purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of preferred stock of Sunesis for $14.0 million, the fair value of the shares. In December 2002, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement with Sunesis related to the discovery and development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Under the terms of this agreement, we purchased 1.25 million shares of preferred stock of Sunesis for $6.0 million, the fair value of the shares. We acquired certain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize certain compounds resulting from the collaboration. Our investments in Sunesis are included in investments and other assets. In addition to the previous agreements entered into with Sunesis, in September 2005 we purchased $5.0 million of common stock of Sunesis as part of their initial public offering, or IPO. Also, in conjunction with the IPO, our preferred stock was converted into shares of Sunesis common stock. As a result of the IPO valuation, we wrote down the value of our investment in the converted shares and, in the third quarter of 2005, recognized a $4.6 million charge for the impairment of our Sunesis investment that was determined to be other than temporary. Following the IPO, we own approximately 2.9 million shares, or 13.6% of shares outstanding, of Sunesis common stock with a fair value of $14.5 million, which is included in investments and other assets. Additionally, Sunesis used a portion of their proceeds from the IPO to repay $4.0 million borrowed from us under a credit facility that we provided to Sunesis in connection with our 2002 collaborative agreement. The credit facility was then terminated in 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded $1.0 million to research and development expense for milestones achieved through the collaboration with Sunesis, of which $0.5 million was paid to Sunesis in 2005. We have committed to paying Sunesis additional amounts upon the completion of certain future research milestones and first and second indication development milestones. If all the milestones were to be achieved based on our plan of research, we would be required to pay up to an additional $302.0 million to Sunesis, excluding royalties. In July 2004, we and Elan entered into a patent license agreement with Genentech for a non exclusive license to certain Genentech patents related to the manufacture of licensed products, including TYSABRI. As a part of the agreement, we and Elan paid a $1.0 million license grant fee upon execution of the agreement, which was charged to research and development expenses, and we paid an additional $1.0 million in 2005 that was due on the first anniversary of the agreement. In addition, we and Elan each paid a development milestone fee of $2.5 million related to the approval of TYSABRI by the FDA in November 2004, half of which was paid in 2004 upon approval of TYSABRI and half of which was paid in 2005 on the anniversary of such approval. At December 31, 2005, our $2.5 million total milestone fee is included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized to cost of product revenues over the life of the patent. The agreement also requires that we or Elan pay royalties on net sales of TYSABRI and other licensed products. In June 2004, we entered into a collaborative research and development agreement with Vernalis plc, or Vernalis, aimed at advancing research into Vernalis adenosine A2A receptor antagonist program, which targets Parkinsons disease and other central nervous system disorders. Under the agreement, we receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Vernalis lead compound, BIIB014, formerly V2006. We paid Vernalis an initial license fee of $10.0 million in July 2004, which was recorded in research and development expenses in the second quarter of 2004. Terms of the collaborative agreement may require us to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain program objectives and pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. In June 2004, we made an investment of $5.5 million through subscription for approximately 6.2 million new Vernalis common shares, representing 4.19% of Vernalis post financing issued share capital, and committed to purchase an additional $4.0 million in the event of future Vernalis financing. In March 2005, we purchased approximately 1.4 million additional shares under a qualified offering for $1.8 million, which fully satisfies our investment obligation under the collaboration agreement. We now hold a total of approximately 7.6 million shares of Vernalis, representing 2.4% of total shares outstanding. Our investment in Vernalis is included in investments and other assets and has a fair value of $8.0 million at December 31, 2005. We account for our investment in Vernalis using the cost method of accounting, subject to periodic review of impairment. If all the milestones were to be achieved, we would be required to pay up to an additional $88.0 million, excluding royalties, over the remaining life of the agreement. 66 Table of Contents In May 2004, we entered into a limited partnership agreement as a limited partner with MPM Bioventures III GP, LP, to create MPM Bioventures Strategic Fund, LP, or the Strategic Fund. The purpose of the Strategic Fund is to make, manage, and supervise investments in biotechnology companies with novel products or technologies that fit strategically with Biogen Idec. The Strategic Fund takes only minority positions in the equity of its investments, and does not seek to engage in day to day management of the entities. In February 2006, we adjusted our commitment to the Strategic Fund to approximately $35 million over a three year period. Through December 31, 2005, we contributed $14.8 million to the Strategic Fund. In April 2004, we became a limited partner in MPM Bioventures III QP, LP, or the LP, a limited partnership that invests in entities that are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, marketing and or sale of novel biological products or technologies. We have committed to contribute $4.0 million to the LP. Through December 31, 2005, we have contributed $2.8 million into the LP, which is included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In February 2006, we became a limited partner in MPM Bioventures IV QP, LP a limited partnership that invests in entities that are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, marketing and or sale of novel biological products or technologies. We have committed to contribute $10.0 million to the LP and made an initial contribution of $1.0 million to the LP. In September 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a license agreement with Fumapharm AG, or Fumapharm, under which Biogen, Inc. obtained exclusive rights to develop and market a second generation fumarate derivative with an immunomodulatory mechanism of action, which is currently in clinical trials in Europe. Under the terms of this agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution license for psoriasis, and a production and exclusive marketing and distribution license for the entire world for MS. No payments were made to Fumapharm in 2005 for the achievement of certain milestones. During 2004, we made payments totaling $4.2 million to Fumapharm for the achievement of certain milestones, which were expensed to research and development expense. We have committed to paying Fumapharm additional amounts upon the completion of certain future research milestones and first and second indication development milestones. If all the milestones were to be achieved, we would be required to pay up to an additional 20.0 million Swiss francs, or approximately $15.2 million, plus royalties over the remaining life of the agreement. In August 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement with Vetter Pharma Fertigung GmbH & Co. KG, or Vetter, for the fill finish of our products, including liquid AVONEX and TYSABRI. Under the terms of this agreement, we made a partial advance payment to Vetter of 35.0 million Euros in return for reserving certain capacity at Vetters fill finish facility. As of December 31, 2005, we have made payments totaling $35.3 million to Vetter for the achievement of certain milestones under the terms of our supply agreement for reserving certain capacity at Vetters fill finish facility. Approximately $2.3 million of these payments are recorded in other current assets and $33.0 million in investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The asset will be recognized as cost of product revenues over the units produced upon delivery to us, which is expected to begin in the second half of 2006. We have total potential milestone payments of approximately 5.3 million Euros remaining as part of the agreement, which we expect to pay on or about initiation of fill finish services. In August 2000, Biogen, Inc. entered into a development and marketing collaboration agreement with Elan to collaborate in the development, manufacture and commercialization of TYSABRI. In November 2004, we received approval by the FDA to market TYSABRI as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS to reduce frequency of clinical relapses. We are also developing TYSABRI as a potential treatment for Crohns disease. In February 2005, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI and suspended dosing in clinical trials of TYSABRI. See Overview for a description of the suspension and related events. Under the terms of this agreement, we share costs with Elan for on going development activities. As of December 31, 2005, Elan owed us $21.1 million, representing commercialization and development expenses that we incurred, which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We received $11.6 million from Elan in the first quarter of 2006 related to the receivable. 67 Table of Contents In June 1999, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Schering AG, aimed at the development and commercialization of ZEVALIN. Under the terms of the agreement, we may receive milestone and research and development support payments totaling up to $47.5 million, subject to the attainment of product development objectives. Schering AG received exclusive marketing and distribution rights to ZEVALIN outside the U.S., and we will continue to receive royalties on product sales by Schering AG. Under the terms of a separate supply agreement, we are obligated to meet Schering AGs clinical and commercial requirements for ZEVALIN. Schering AG may terminate these agreements for any reason. During 2004 and 2003, we recognized revenues from our agreements with Schering AG of $10.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, which are included in corporate partner revenues. Under the above agreement, amounts earned by us and recognized as revenue for contract research and development approximate the research and development expenses incurred under the related agreement. As part of previous agreements that Biogen, Inc. had with Targeted Genetics Corporation, or Targeted, for gene therapy research and development, we own approximately 11.7 million shares of Targeteds common stock with a fair value of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2005, which is included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In the first quarter of 2005, we recognized a $9.2 million charge for the impairment of our Targeted investment that was determined to be other than temporary. We have no remaining commitments or obligations with Targeted. Legal Matters On March 2, 2005, we, along with William H. Rastetter, our former Executive Chairman, and James C. Mullen, our Chief Executive Officer, were named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit, captioned Brown v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the Court). The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder. The action is purportedly brought on behalf of all purchasers of our publicly traded securities between February 18, 2004 and February 25, 2005. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI in order to gain accelerated approval from the FDA for the products distribution and sale. The plaintiff alleges that these materially false and misleading statements harmed the purported class by artificially inflating our stock price during the purported class period and that company insiders benefited personally from the inflated price by selling our stock. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, as well as interest, costs and attorneys fees. Substantially similar actions, captioned Grill v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al. and Lobel v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al., were filed on March 10, 2005 and April 21, 2005, respectively, in the same court by other purported class representatives. Those actions have been assigned to District Judge Reginald C. Lindsay and Magistrate Judge Marianne C. Bowler. On July 26, 2005, the three cases were consolidated and by Margin Order dated September 23, 2005, Magistrate Judge Bowler appointed lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of co lead counsel. An objection to the September 23, 2005 order was filed on October 7, 2005. The affected plaintiffs objection is fully briefed and is pending with the Court. We believe that the actions are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously. At this early stage of litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. On March 4, 2005, a purported shareholder derivative action, captioned Halpern v. Rastetter, et al. (Halpern), was filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, in New Castle County (the Chancery Court), on our behalf, against us as nominal defendant, our Board of Directors and our former general counsel. The plaintiff derivatively claims breaches of fiduciary duty by our Board of Directors for inadequate oversight of our policies, practices, controls and assets, and for recklessly awarding executive bonuses despite alleged awareness of potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI and the potential for related harm to our financial position. The plaintiff also derivatively claims that our former Executive Chairman, former general counsel and a director misappropriated confidential company information for personal profit by selling our stock while in possession of material, non public information regarding the potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI, and alleges that our Board of Directors did not ensure that appropriate policies were in place regarding the control of confidential information and personal trading in our securities by officers and directors. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, profits, the return of all bonuses paid by us, costs and attorneys fees. A substantially similar action, captioned Golaine v. Rastetter, et al. (Golaine), was filed on March 14, 2005 in the same court. Neither of the plaintiffs made presuit demand on our Board of Directors prior to filing their respective actions. We filed an Answer and 68 Table of Contents Affirmative Defenses in Halpern on March 31, 2005 and our Board of Directors filed an Answer and Affirmative Defenses on April 11, 2005, which was amended as of April 12, 2005. By Order dated April 14, 2005, Halpern and Golaine were consolidated, captioned In re Biogen Idec Inc. Derivative Litigation (the Delaware Action) and the Halpern complaint was deemed the operative complaint in the Delaware Action. On May 19, 2005, we and our Board of Directors filed a motion seeking judgment on the pleadings, and on August 3, 2005, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking voluntary dismissal of the action. On September 27, 2005, the Chancery Court entered an Order providing that the plaintiffs in the purported derivative cases pending in the Superior Court of California and the Middlesex Superior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may file a complaint in intervention in the Delaware Action not later than October 28, 2005 (the Delaware Order). The Delaware Order further provides that if no such complaint in intervention is timely filed, then the Court shall enter a further order and final judgment finding that the Delaware Action has not alleged, as a matter of controlling substantive Delaware law, demand excusal as to the claims raised in the Delaware Action and granting defendants motions and dismissing the litigation with prejudice on the merits. No complaint in intervention was filed. Accordingly, by Order dated November 14, 2005, the Court dismissed the Delaware Action with prejudice on the merits. The time for filing an appeal in the Delaware Action has expired and no such appeal was taken. On March 9, 2005, two additional purported shareholder derivative actions, captioned Carmona v. Mullen, et al. (Carmona) and Fink v. Mullen, et al. (Fink), were brought in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego (the California Court), on our behalf, against us as nominal defendant, our Board of Directors and our chief financial officer. The plaintiffs derivatively claim breach of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment against all defendants. The plaintiffs also derivatively claim insider selling in violation of California Corporations Code 25402 and breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of information against certain defendants who sold our securities during the period of February 18, 2004 to the date of the complaints. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants caused and or allowed us to issue, and conspired, aided and abetted and acted in concert in concealing that we were issuing, false and misleading press releases about the safety of TYSABRI and its financial prospects which resulted in legal claims being asserted against us, irreparable harm to our corporate image, depression of our stock price and impairment of our ability to raise capital. The plaintiffs also allege that certain defendants sold personally owned shares of our stock while in possession of material, undisclosed, adverse information. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, treble damages for the purported insider trading in violation of California Corporate Code 25402, equitable relief including restriction of the defendants trading proceeds or other assets, restitution, disgorgement and costs, including attorneys fees and expenses. Neither of the plaintiffs made presuit demand on the Board of Directors prior to filing their respective actions. On April 11, 2005, all defendants filed a Motion To Stay Proceedings in both Carmona and Fink, which the plaintiffs opposed, pending resolution of the Delaware Action. On May 11, 2005, the California Court consolidated the Carmona and Fink cases (the California Action). On May 27, 2005, the California Court granted defendants Motion to Stay; the stay currently remains in effect. On September 27, 2005, defendants provided plaintiffs with a copy of the Delaware Order. Plaintiffs did not file a complaint in intervention in the Delaware Action. On December 23, 2005, defendants filed and served a notice advising the California Court of the dismissal of the Delaware Action. On January 24, 2006, the parties submitted a proposed scheduling order addressing amendments to the original pleading and motion to dismiss briefing, which the Court entered on January 25, 2006. Pursuant to that scheduling order, on February 3, 2006, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which, among other amendments to the allegations, added our former general counsel as a defendant. Defendants response to the amended complaint is due in early March, and briefing is to be completed prior to the hearing scheduled for late April 2006. These purported derivative actions do not seek affirmative relief from the Company. We believe the plaintiffs claims lack merit and intend to litigate the dispute vigorously. We are currently unable to determine whether resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, or reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, if any, that may result from resolution of this matter. On June 20, 2005, a purported class action, captioned Wayne v. Biogen Idec Inc. and Elan Pharmaceutical Management Corp., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the California District Court). On August 15, 2005, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint purports to assert claims for strict product liability, medical monitoring and concert of action arising out of the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of TYSABRI. The action is purportedly brought on behalf of all persons in the 69 Table of Contents U.S. who have had infusions of TYSABRI and who have not been diagnosed with any medical conditions resulting from TYSABRI use. The plaintiff alleges that defendants, acting individually and in concert, failed to warn the public about purportedly known risks related to TYSABRI use. The plaintiff seeks to recover the cost of periodic medical examinations, restitution, interest, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees. On January 20, 2006, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, which the Court entered on January 24, 2006. Our Board of Directors has received letters, dated March 1, 2005, March 15, 2005 and May 23, 2005, respectively, on behalf of purported owners of our securities purportedly constituting demands under Delaware law. A supplement to the March 1 letter was received on March 2, 2005. The letters generally allege that certain of our officers and directors breached their fiduciary duty to us by selling personally held shares of our securities while in possession of material, non public information about potential serious side effects of TYSABRI. The letters generally request that our Board of Directors take action on our behalf to recover compensation and profits from the officers and directors, consider enhanced corporate governance controls related to the sales of securities by insiders, and pursue other such equitable relief, damages, and other remedies as may be appropriate. A special litigation committee of our Board of Directors was formed, and, with the assistance of independent outside counsel, investigated the allegations set forth in the demand letters. By letters dated August 17, 2005 and October 1, 2005, our Board of Directors informed those shareholders that it would not take action as demanded because it was the Boards determination that such action was not in the best interests of the Company. On June 23, 2005, one of the purported shareholders who made demand filed a purported derivative action in the Middlesex Superior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Massachusetts Court), on our behalf, against us as nominal defendant, our former general counsel, a member of our Board of Directors and our former Executive Chairman. The plaintiff derivatively claims that our former Executive Chairman, former general counsel and the director defendant misappropriated confidential company information for personal profit by selling our stock while in possession of material, non public information regarding the potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI. The plaintiff seeks disgorgement of profits, costs and attorneys fees. On September 27, 2005, the plaintiff was provided with a copy of the Delaware Order and responded on September 28, 2005, that he would not be moving to intervene in Delaware. On October 4, 2005, all defendants filed motions seeking dismissal of the action and or judgment on the pleadings, and the Company also filed a supplemental motion seeking judgment on the pleadings. Also on October 4, 2005, the plaintiff filed a cross motion seeking leave to amend the complaint, which the Company has opposed. On November 14, 2005, the Massachusetts Court heard oral argument on the various motions. By Memorandum and Order dated January 31, 2006, the Massachusetts Court granted leave to amend and, as to such amended complaint, granted Defendants motion to dismiss. On April 21, 2005, we received a formal order of investigation from the Boston District Office of the SEC. The SEC is investigating whether any violations of the federal securities laws occurred in connection with the suspension of marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI. We continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in this investigation. We are unable to predict the outcome of this investigation or the timing of its resolution at this time. On June 9, 2005, we, along with numerous other companies, received a request for information from the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, or the Committee, concerning the Committees review of issues relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs coverage of prescription drug benefits. On January 9, 2006, we, along with numerous other companies, received a further request for information from the Committee. We are cooperating fully with the Committees information requests. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review or the timing of its resolution at this time. On July 20, 2005, a products liability action captioned Walter Smith, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Anita Smith, decedent, and Walter Smith, individually v. Biogen Idec Inc. and Elan Corp., PLC, was commenced in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Middlesex County. The complaint purports to assert statutory wrongful death claims based on negligence, agency principles, fraud, breach of warranties, loss of consortium, conscious pain and suffering, and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of Mass. G.L., c. 93A. The complaint alleges that Anita Smith, a participant in a TYSABRI clinical trial, died as a result of PML caused by TYSABRI and that the defendants, individually and jointly, prematurely used TYSABRI in a clinical trial, failed to adequately design the clinical trial, failed to adequately monitor patients participating in the clinical trial, and failed to adequately address and warn of the risks of PML, immunosuppression and risks associated with 70 Table of Contents the pharmacokinetics of TYSABRI when used in combination with AVONEX. The plaintiff seeks compensatory, punitive and multiple damages as well as interest, costs and attorneys fees. We believe that the action is without merit and intend to contest it vigorously. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential range of loss. On October 4, 2004, Genentech, Inc. received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting documents related to the promotion of RITUXAN. We market RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with Genentech. Genentech has disclosed that it is cooperating with the associated investigation, which they disclosed that they have been advised is both civil and criminal in nature. The potential outcome of this matter and its impact on us cannot be determined at this time. On August 10, 2004, Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. filed suit against us, GlaxoSmithKline, Chiron Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., and Kaiser Permanente, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, contending that we induced infringement of U.S. patents 6,420,139, 6,638,739, 5,728,385, and 5,723,283, all of which are directed to various methods of immunization or determination of immunization schedules. The inducement of infringement claims are based on allegations that we provided instructions and or recommendations on a proper immunization schedule for vaccines to other defendants who are alleged to have directly infringed the patents at issue. We are investigating the allegations, however, we do not believe them to be based in fact. On November 19, 2004, we, along with GlaxoSmithKline, filed a joint motion to dismiss three of the four counts of the complaint. The court granted that motion on July 22, 2005. On August 1, 2005, Classen filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied on December 14, 2005. Classen also filed a motion to dismiss the third, and final, count against us with prejudice. We did not oppose that motion, and the Court dismissed that count against GlaxoSmithKline and us in its December 14, 2005 order. On January 5, 2006, Classen filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the Courts July 22, 2005 and December 14, 2005 decisions. Under our 1988 license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, GlaxoSmithKline is obligated to indemnify and defend us against these claims. In the event that the nature of the claims change such that GlaxoSmithKline is no longer obligated to indemnify and defend us and we are unsuccessful in the present litigation we may be liable for damages suffered by Classen and such other relief as Classen may seek and be granted by the court. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. Along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, Biogen, Inc. (now Biogen Idec MA, Inc., one of our wholly owned subsidiaries) or, in certain cases, Biogen Idec, Inc., was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed by the City of New York and the following Counties of the State of New York: County of Albany, County of Allegany, County of Broome, County of Cattaraugus, County of Cayuga, County of Chautauqua, County of Chenango, County of Columbia, County of Cortland, County of Dutchess, County of Erie, County of Essex, County of Fulton, County of Genesee, County of Greene, County of Herkimer, County of Jefferson, County of Lewis, County of Madison, County of Monroe, County of Nassau, County of Niagara, County of Oneida, County of Onondaga, County of Ontario, County of Orleans, County of Putnam, County of Rensselaer, County of Rockland, County of St. Lawrence, County of Saratoga, County of Schuyler, County of Seneca, County of Steuben, County of Suffolk, County of Tompkins, County of Warren, County of Washington, County of Wayne, County of Westchester, and County of Yates. All of the cases, except for the County of Erie and County of Nassau cases, are the subject of a Consolidated Complaint, which was filed on June 15, 2005 in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Multi District Litigation No. 1456. The County of Nassau, which originally filed its complaint on November 24, 2004, filed an amended complaint on March 24, 2005 and that case is also pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The County of Erie originally filed its complaint in Supreme Court of the State of New York on March 8, 2005. On April 15, 2005, Biogen Idec and the other named defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. On August 11, 2005, the Joint Panel on Multi District Litigation issued a Transfer Order, transferring the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The County of Erie has filed a motion to remand the case back to the Supreme Court of the State of New York, which is currently pending before the District Court in the District of Massachusetts. All of the complaints allege that the defendants fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for certain drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement, also referred to as Covered Drugs; marketed and promoted the sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the providers ability to collect inflated payments from the government and Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for competing drugs; provided financing incentives to 71 Table of Contents providers to over prescribe Covered Drugs or to prescribe Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs; and overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered Drugs reimbursements. The complaints allege violations of New York state law and advance common law claims for unfair trade practices, fraud, and unjust enrichment. In addition, all of the complaints, with the exception of the County of Erie complaint, allege that the defendants failed to accurately report the best price on the Covered Drugs to the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to rebate agreements entered into with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and excluded from their reporting certain drugs offered at discounts and other rebates that would have reduced the best price. On April 8, 2005, the court dismissed the claims brought by Suffolk County against Biogen Idec and eighteen other defendants in a complaint filed on August 1, 2003. The court held that Suffolk Countys documentation was insufficient to plead allegations of fraud. Neither Biogen Idec nor the other defendants have answered or responded to the complaints that are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, as all of the plaintiffs have agreed to stay the time to respond until a case management order and briefing schedule have been approved by the Court. Biogen Idec intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the allegations and claims in these lawsuits. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. Biogen Idec, Inc., along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, was also named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Attorney General of Arizona. The lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona on December 6, 2005. The complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for certain drugs covered by the State of Arizonas Medicare and Medicaid programs, and marketed these drugs to providers based on the providers ability to collect inflated payments from the government and other third party payors. The complaint alleges violations of Arizona state law based on consumer fraud and racketeering. The defendants have removed this case to federal court and have petitioned the Joint Panel on Multi District Litigation for a Transfer Order to transfer the case to Multi District Litigation No. 1456 pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Biogen Idec intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the allegations and claims in this lawsuit. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. On January 6, 2006, we were served with a lawsuit, captioned United States of America ex rel. Paul P. McDermott v. Genentech, Inc. and Biogen Idec, Inc., filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. The lawsuit was filed under seal on July 29, 2005 by a former employee of our co defendant Genentech pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq. On December 20, 2005, the U.S. government elected not to intervene, and the file was subsequently unsealed and served on us. The plaintiff alleges that we illegally marketed and promoted off label uses of the prescription drug RITUXAN for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and that this off label marketing and promotion resulted in the defrauding of Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration medical reimbursement systems. The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that we directly solicited physicians for off label uses of RITUXAN for treating rheumatoid arthritis, paid physicians to promote these off label uses of RITUXAN, trained our employees in methods of avoiding the detection of these off label sales and marketing activities, and formed a network of employees whose assigned duties involved off label promotion of RITUXAN. The plaintiff seeks the entry of judgment on behalf of the United States of America against the defendants as well as all costs, attorneys fees, statutory awards permitted under the False Claims Act and allowable interest. On February 27, 2006, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the complaint fails to state a claim and the claims were not pleaded with particularity. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss. In addition, on February 24, 2006, Michael Bannester, whom we believe is affiliated with the law firm representing the McDermott plaintiff, filed a citizens petition with the FDA that alleges substantially the same allegations set forth in the McDermott complaint and requests that the FDA stay its approval of our request to market RITUXAN for the treatment of RA or that the petition be decided on an expedited basis. On February 28, 2006, the FDA approved the sBLA for use of RITUXAN, in combination with methotrexate, for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. On February 24, 2006, a purported customer of TYSABRI in Louisiana commenced a Petition for Redhibition in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, against Biogen Idec and Elan Pharmaceuticals, captioned as Jill Czapla v. Biogen Idec and Elan Pharmaceuticals, Civil Action No. 06 0945. The plaintiff 72 Table of Contents commenced the action on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, specifically all persons, natural and juridical, who purchased an infusion drug TYSABRI (natalizumab) in Louisiana. The plaintiff seeks rescission of the sale, return of the purchase price, expenses incidental to the sale, attorneys fees and interest, but excludes from the relief sought any damages related to any personal injuries suffered because of the consumption of TYSABRI. We have not been served with the complaint and are presently evaluating the plaintiffs contentions. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against all of the allegations and claims in this lawsuit. At this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of potential loss or range of loss. In addition, we are involved in certain other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal business activities. While the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances, marketable securities, derivative and hedging activities, inventories, patents, income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, impairment for intangible assets and goodwill, valuation of long lived assets and investments, research and development, loans, pensions, retiree medical plan, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, or SAB 101, superceded in part by SAB 104, provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. SAB 104 establishes the SECs view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. SAB 104 also requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized. We believe that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 104. Product revenue consists of sales from four of our products: AVONEX, AMEVIVE, ZEVALIN, and TYSABRI. The timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings. Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, typically upon delivery. Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns, patient assistance, trade term discounts, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration rebates, managed care discounts and other applicable allowances. Included in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, are allowances for returns, rebates, discounts and other allowances which totaled $48.8 million and $35.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005, our allowance for product returns, which is a component of allowances for returns, rebates, discounts and other allowances, was $2.3 million. At December 31, 2005, total discounts and allowances were approximately 3% of total current assets and less than 1% of total assets. We prepare our estimates for sales returns and allowances, discounts and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. If actual future results vary, we may need to adjust our estimates, which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment. In the past, our estimates based on historical experience have not materially differed from actual results. We closely monitor levels of inventory in the distribution channel. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately, on average, 2 to 3 weeks of inventory in the distribution channel. The shelf life associated with our products 73 Table of Contents is long, 15 to 30 months, depending on the product. Obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern, given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel. Changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us. We do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, we recorded $225.9 million, $169.3 million and $13.9 million, respectively, in our consolidated statements of income related to sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates. Our sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates in 2005 were higher than 2004 due to sales returns related to the suspension to TYSABRI, product price increases and new distributor and managed care agreements. Our sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates in 2004 were substantially higher than 2003, since sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates related to AVONEX and AMEVIVE were included in our results of operations for all of 2004 as opposed to 2003, when sales returns and allowances, discounts, and rebates related to AVONEX and AMEVIVE were included in our results of operations only for the period from November 13, 2003 through December 31, 2003. In 2005, the amount of product returns was approximately 2% of product revenue for all our products, compared to approximately 1% in 2004 and 2% in 2003. Product returns, which is a component of allowances for returns, rebates, discounts and other allowances, were $26.0 million, $17.4 million and $3.7 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase of product returns in 2005 consisted primarily of $9.7 million, due to the voluntary suspension of TYSABRI. Product returns in 2005 included $12.2 million related to product sales made prior to 2005, which represents less than 1% of total product revenues, of which $4.7 million was reserved for at December 31, 2004. During 2004, we had encountered problems in manufacturing our pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX, and as a result, we had an increase in our expected level of returns related to batches that failed to meet specifications. In November 2004, we received regulatory approval in the U.S. of TYSABRI for the treatment of MS and paid a $7.0 million approval based milestone to Elan. Upon approval, we also became obligated to provide Elan with $5.3 million against reimbursement of commercialization costs. Elan can apply $1.5 million of the credits per year. The approval and credit milestones were capitalized upon approval in investments and other assets and are being amortized over the remaining patent life of 14.6 years. The amortization of the approval and credit milestones is being recorded as a reduction of revenue. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. Under our agreement with Elan, we manufacture TYSABRI and, in the U.S. prior to the suspension, sold TYSABRI to Elan who then distributed TYSABRI to third party distributors. Prior to the suspension, we recorded revenue when TYSABRI was shipped from Elan to third party distributors. In 2005, we recorded $4.7 million of net product revenues related to sales of TYSABRI to Elan that we estimate were ultimately dosed into patients. Additionally, as of March 31, 2005, we deferred $14.0 million in revenue under our revenue recognition policy with Elan, which has been fully paid by Elan, related to sales of TYSABRI which had not yet been shipped by Elan and remains deferred at December 31, 2005. Through December 31, 2005, we incurred net withdrawal costs of $7.8 million related to sales returns in connection with the voluntary suspension of TYSABRI. Should our estimate of expected sales returns and allowances be materially different from actual returns, then we may be required to record adjustments, which could result in additional revenues or further reductions of revenue. We have various contracts with distributors that provide for discounts and rebates. These contracts are classified as a reduction of revenue. We also maintain select customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel. We have established the fair value of these contracts and classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense. If we had concluded that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for these contracts, we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of the RITUXAN pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with Genentech, reimbursement from Genentech of our RITUXAN related sales force and development expenses and royalties from Genentech for sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Under the copromotion arrangement, all U.S. sales of RITUXAN and associated costs and expenses are recognized by Genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis, as defined in our amended and restated collaboration agreement with Genentech. Pretax copromotion profits 74 Table of Contents under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking U.S. net sales of RITUXAN to third party customers less cost of sales, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. Our profit sharing formula with Genentech has two tiers; we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met. The profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier. In June 2003, we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with Genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti CD20 antibodies targeting B cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of indications. Upon approval of the first new anti CD20 product, the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and other anti CD20 products will change over a period of time to a fixed annual profit sharing percentage at the lower tier. Currently, we record our share of expenses incurred for the development of new anti CD20 products in research and development expense until such time as a new product is approved, at which time we will record our share of pretax copromotion profits related to the new product in revenues from unconsolidated joint business. We record our royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a cash basis. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of new anti CD20 products and only for the first 11 years from the date of first commercial sale of such new anti CD20 products. We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which we have rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees. There are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements. Under this policy, revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution of royalty disputes and arbitration. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required, which could affect future earnings. Marketable Securities and Investments We invest our excess cash balances in short term and long term marketable securities, principally corporate notes and government securities. At December 31, 2005, substantially all of our securities were classified as available for sale. All available for sale securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in shareholders equity, net of related tax effects. Realized gains and losses and declines in value, if any, judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in other expense. In 2005, we recognized a charge of approximately $3.1 million for certain unrealized losses on available for sale securities that were determined to be other than temporary, because we expected that the securities would be sold prior to a potential recovery of their decline in value. Any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings. The cost of available for sale securities sold is based on the specific identification method. We have established guidelines that maintain safety and provide adequate liquidity in our available for sale portfolio. These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates. As part of our strategic product development efforts, we invest in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, addresses the accounting for investment in marketable equity securities. As a matter of policy, we determine on a quarterly basis whether any decline in the fair value of a marketable security is temporary or other than temporary. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in shareholders equity, 75 Table of Contents net of related tax effects. If a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is determined to be other than temporary, such marketable security is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings. The factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security, the duration of the securitys decline, and prospects for the company, including favorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements. In 2005, we recognized a $9.2 million charge for the impairment of an investment that was determined to be other than temporary following a decline in value during the first quarter of 2005 due to unfavorable clinical results and the future prospects for the company. Any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings. At December 31, 2005, we had $7.3 million of unrealized losses related to these marketable securities. The fair market value of these marketable securities totaled $143.6 million at December 31, 2005. We also invest in equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and fair value is not readily available. These investments are recorded using the cost method of accounting and, as a matter of policy, we monitor these investments in private securities on a quarterly basis, and determine whether any impairment in their value would require a charge to current earnings, based on the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee, market prices of comparable public companies, and general market conditions. At December 31, 2005, we included approximately $26.1 million of investments in private securities in investments and other assets. In the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a $4.6 million charge for the impairment of an investment that completed an initial public offering during the period, when we determined that the offering price and our unrealized loss related to the entity as of September 30, 2005 was not likely to be recovered to our carrying value prior to the company being publicly traded. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a $1.6 million charge for the impairment of an investment that was determined to be other than temporary due to the future prospects for the company. There were no significant charges to current earnings in 2004 or 2003 for impairments of these investments. Additional recognition of impairments for these securities may cause variability in earnings. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in, first out, or FIFO, method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval, including safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization. We are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. There is a risk inherent in these judgments, which is the reason we disclose the risk and the potential for a change in judgment. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, all products included in inventory have been approved for sale by either the EMEA or FDA. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. In addition, we suspended dosing in clinical studies of TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease 76 Table of Contents and RA. These decisions were based on reports of cases PML, a rare and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies. We and Elan conducted a safety evaluation of patients treated with TYSABRI in MS, Crohns disease and RA clinical studies. The safety evaluation included the review of any reports of potential PML in MS patients receiving TYSABRI in the commercial setting. In October 2005, we completed the safety evaluation and found no new confirmed cases of PML. Three confirmed cases of PML were previously reported, two of which were fatal. In September 2005, we submitted an sBLA for TYSABRI to the FDA for the treatment of MS. In November 2005, we were granted Priority Review status for the sBLA, which will result in action by the FDA approximately six months from the submission date, or by March 2006. In January 2006, we and Elan announced that we had received notification from the FDA that the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee would review TYSABRI for the treatment of MS on March 7, 2006. We and Elan have also submitted a similar data package to the EMEA. This information was supplied as part of the ongoing EMEA review process, which was initiated in the summer of 2004 with the filing for approval of TYSABRI as a treatment for MS. In February 2006, we and Elan announced that the FDA informed the companies that they removed the hold on clinical trial dosing of TYSABRI. We and Elan expect to begin an open label, multi center safety extension study of TYSABRI monotherapy in the U.S. and internationally in the coming weeks. We plan to work with regulatory authorities to determine if dosing in MS and other clinical studies will be re initiated and the future commercial availability of the product. We cannot predict the outcome of our work with regulatory authorities. TYSABRI could be permanently withdrawn from the market or re introduced to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses, black box or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions, requirements and limitations as the FDA, EMEA or other regulatory authorities may require. While we presently believe that we will be able to find a path forward for TYSABRI, there are no assurances as to the likelihood of success. In light of our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that our TYSABRI inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we wrote down all of the $19.1 million of TYSABRI inventory that had been included on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2004, which was charged to cost of product revenues. We manufactured TYSABRI during the first and second quarter of 2005 and completed our scheduled production of TYSABRI during July 2005. Because of the uncertain future commercial availability of TYSABRI and our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that TYSABRI inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we expensed $23.2 million of costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI in the first quarter of 2005 to cost of product revenues. At the time of production, the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable. Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, as we were working with clinical investigators to understand the possible risks of PML, we charged the costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense. As a result, we expensed $21.5 million related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense during 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, in light of expectations of re introduction of TYSABRI, we began a new manufacturing campaign. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect Our Growth. We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. This periodic review led to the write downs of TYSABRI inventory as of December 31, 2004 and the expensing of TYSABRI during 2005, as described above, and may lead us to expense TYSABRI in subsequent periods. Our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration, in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value. In 2005, we wrote down $30.3 million, $12.0 million and $10.1 million of unmarketable inventory related to AMEVIVE, AVONEX and ZEVALIN, respectively, which was charged to cost of product revenues. The write downs for AMEVIVE inventory consisted of $10.0 million for expired product and $20.3 million for product that failed to meet quality specifications. The write downs of AVONEX inventory consisted of $8.4 million for remaining supplies of the alternative presentations of AVONEX that were no longer needed after 77 Table of Contents the FDA approved a new component for the pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX in March 2005, $2.8 million for product that failed to meet quality specifications and $0.8 million of expired product. The write down of ZEVALIN inventory was related to inventory that would not be marketable based on estimates of demand. As part of our comprehensive strategic plan, we are seeking to divest AMEVIVE. We have evaluated our AMEVIVE inventory based on third party contract negotiations and determined its expected net realizable value. As a result, we recorded charges of $31.8 million to cost of product revenues in 2005 to write down AMEVIVE to its net realizable value at December 31, 2005. In addition, our AMEVIVE inventory balance at December 31, 2005 was $49.8 million, of which $24.8 million related to the historical manufacturing costs and $25.0 million related to the increase in fair market value of inventory acquired at the Merger. We wrote down $46.7 million of unmarketable inventory during 2004, which was charged to cost of product revenues and consisted of $16.2 million related to AVONEX, $9.7 million related to ZEVALIN, $1.7 million related to AMEVIVE and $19.1 million related to TYSABRI. The AVONEX and AMEVIVE inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications. The ZEVALIN inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications or when it was determined that the inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand. In 2003, cost of product revenues consisted of $254.3 million related to AVONEX, $18.7 million related to ZEVALIN and $8.7 million related to AMEVIVE, of which $231.6 million represents the difference between the cost of inventory recorded at the acquisition date and its historical manufacturing cost for AVONEX and AMEVIVE. In 2003, we wrote down $160.8 million related to AVONEX, $1.0 million related to AMEVIVE and $12.1 million related to ZEVALIN. Of the $160.8 million write down related to AVONEX, $149.6 million represented the increase to fair market value of inventory acquired at the Merger and $11.2 million represented the historical manufacturing costs. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes a provision for income tax contingencies. We utilize a best estimate approach for establishing loss contingencies related to income tax uncertainties based on the definition of a liability in FASB Concept Statement No. 6. These provisions are adjusted when an event occurs or additional information becomes available that impacts the amounts of our estimates. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the IRS completed its exam of legacy Biogen, Inc.s, now Biogen Idec MA, Inc.s consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and issued an assessment. We subsequently paid the majority of the amounts assessed and are appealing one issue. As a result of this and other income tax audit activity, Biogen Idec MA, Inc. reassessed its liability for income tax contingencies to reflect the IRS findings and recorded a $13.8 million reduction in these liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2005. The corresponding effects of the adjustments to the liability for income tax contingencies through 2004 resulted in a reduction in goodwill of $20.7 million for amounts related to periods prior to the acquisition by IDEC Pharmaceutical Corporation and an increase in income tax expense associated with continuing operations of $6.9 million. While we believe that the amount of the tax estimates is reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may differ from provisions for contingencies, and these differences could be significant. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of viable tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the 78 Table of Contents exercise of stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Assets Held for Sale As part of the comprehensive strategic plan that we announced in September 2005, we are seeking to divest several other non core assets, including AMEVIVE, our NICO clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California and certain real property in Oceanside, California. We consider those assets and certain other miscellaneous assets as held for sale, since they meet the criteria of held for sale under SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, and have reported those assets separately in current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005. As discussed above, the NICO clinical manufacturing facility was adjusted to its net realizable value. Our AMEVIVE assets held for sale include $8.0 million related to intangible assets, net, and $5.4 million for property, plant and equipment, net. In February 2006, we sold the NICO clinical manufacturing facility to Genentech. Severance and Other Costs from Restructuring Plan In September 2005, we began implementing a comprehensive strategic plan designed to position us for long term growth. In conjunction with the plan, we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management layers and staff functions, resulting in the reduction of our workforce by approximately 17%, or approximately 650 positions worldwide. These adjustments took place across company functions, departments and sites, and were substantially implemented as of December 31, 2005. We have recorded restructuring charges associated with these activities, which consist primarily of severance and other employee termination costs, including health benefits, outplacement and bonuses. Other costs include write downs of certain research assets that will no longer be utilized, consulting costs in connection with the restructuring effort and costs related to the acceleration of restricted stock, offset by the reversal of previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted stock cancellations. In 2005, restructuring charges of $20.0 million are included in research and development and $11.4 million are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The timing and amounts of these charges are based on the estimated termination dates of the employees and the related termination charges. If actual timing is different than planned, our total restructuring charge amount could change. Any remaining unpaid costs at December 31, 2005 are included in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, contract services and other outside expenses. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. The timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense. Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of management fees, site management and site monitoring costs, and data management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses have not been material and are adjusted for in the period which they become known. We have entered into certain research agreements in which we share expenses with our collaborator. We have entered into other collaborations where we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of our collaborative partners. We record these expenses as research and development expenses. If the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator, we record payments by the collaborator for their share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense. If the arrangement is a reimbursement of research and development expenses, we record the reimbursement as corporate partner revenue. 79 Table of Contents We manufactured TYSABRI during the first and second quarter of 2005 and completed our scheduled production of TYSABRI during July 2005. Because of the uncertain future commercial availability of TYSABRI and our inability to predict with the required degree of certainty that TYSABRI inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we expensed $23.2 million of costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI in the first quarter of 2005 to cost of product revenues. At the time of production, the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable. Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, we charged the costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense. As a result, we expensed $21.5 million related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense during 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, in light of expectations of re introduction of TYSABRI, we began a new manufacturing campaign. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We have operations in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada in connection with the sale of AVONEX. We also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Euro, Swedish krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar). We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk and do not engage in currency speculation. We use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, or SFAS 133, requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. We assess, both at their inception and on an on going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. We assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument, and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings. Under this policy, and in accordance with SFAS 133, earnings may vary if the forecasted transaction does not occur, or if there is material hedge ineffectiveness or if the hedge ceases to be highly effective. Impairments of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets to be held and used, including intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Long lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell. In the third and fourth quarters of 2005, in connection with our comprehensive strategic plan, we recorded impairment charges of $28.0 million to facility impairments and loss on sale, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of our NICO clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, and classified the asset as held for sale under SFAS 144. In the third quarter of 2005, we recorded an impairment charge of $12.9 million to selling, general and administrative expense equal to the remaining balance of the prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with MDS (Canada) related to ZEVALIN, since the carrying amount of prepaid expense was not recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of ZEVALIN. In March 2005, we determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod. As a result, in the first quarter of 2005, we recorded an impairment 80 Table of Contents charge to facility impairments and loss on sale of approximately $6.2 million of engineering costs that had previously been capitalized. We have assessed our long lived assets related to TYSABRI, which include intangible assets and facilities, and have determined that there are no impairments related to these assets as a result of the suspension of the marketing of TYSABRI. However, should new information arise, we may be required to take impairment charges related to certain of our long lived assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. Intangible Assets and Goodwill In connection with the Merger, we recorded intangible assets related to patents, trademarks, and core technology as part of the purchase price. These intangible assets were recorded at fair value, and at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 are net of accumulated amortization and impairments. Intangible assets related to out licensed patents and core technology are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 12 to 20 years, based on the greater of straight line method or economic consumption each period. These amortization costs are included in Amortization of acquired intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Intangible assets related to trademarks have indefinite lives, and as a result are not amortized, but are subject to review for impairment. We review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In the third quarter of 2005, we completed a review of our business opportunities in each of the relevant commercial markets in which our products are sold and determined their expected profitability. As a result of this review, in the third quarter of 2005, management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to future sales of AVONEX in Japan may not be recoverable. As a result, we recorded a charge of approximately $7.9 million to amortization of acquired intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to AVONEX. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of $5.7 million to cost of product revenues related to an impairment of certain capitalized ZEVALIN patents, to reflect the adjustment to net realizable value. As part of our decision to divest our AMEVIVE product, we have reassessed our remaining intangible assets related to AMEVIVE, and have determined that there are no impairments related to these assets as a result of our decision to divest AMEVIVE. However, should new information arise, we may be required to take impairment charges related to certain of our intangibles. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we reclassed our intangible assets associated with AMEVIVE totaling $8.0 million on a net basis to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. In the third quarter of 2004, management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE may not be recoverable. As a result, we recorded a charge of approximately $27.8 million to amortization of acquired intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE. Goodwill associated with the Merger represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather subject to periodic review for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill might not be recoverable. As a result of the voluntary suspension of TYSABRI in February 2005, we performed an interim review for impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other long lived assets, and we determined that goodwill was not impaired. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we performed our annual assessment of our goodwill, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired at October 31, 2005. However, should new information arise regarding the voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we may need to reassess goodwill for impairment in light of the new information and we may be required to take impairment charges related to goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the IRS completed its exam of legacy Biogen Inc.s, now Biogen Idec MA Inc.s consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years 2001 through 2002 and issued an assessment. We subsequently paid the majority of the amounts assessed and are appealing one issue. As a result of this and other income tax audit activity, Biogen Idec MA Inc. 81 Table of Contents reassessed its liability for income tax contingencies to reflect the IRS findings and recorded a $13.8 million reduction in these liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2005. The corresponding effects of the adjustments to the liability for income tax contingencies through 2004 resulted in a reduction in goodwill of $20.7 million for amounts related to periods prior to the acquisition by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and an increase in income tax expense associated with continuing operations of $6.9 million. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Safety Issues with TYSABRI Could Significantly Affect our Growth. Contingencies and Litigation There has been, and we expect there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices, regulatory issues, pricing, and patents and other intellectual property rights. Certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future, including in the litigation described under Legal Matters, could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Standards In November 2005, the FASB released FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP, effective January 1, 2006, provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when an impairment of debt and equity securities should be considered other than temporary, as well as the subsequent accounting for these investments. The adoption of this FSP is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and supersedes FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements an amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. When it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented, SFAS 154 requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement. When it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods, SFAS 154 requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable. SFAS 154 shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the provisions of the SFAS 154 will have a significant impact on our results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payments, which replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) will require all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS 123(R) offers alternative methods for determining the fair value. In April 2005, the SEC issued a new rule that allows companies to implement SFAS 123(R) at the beginning of the next fiscal year, instead of the next reporting period, that begins after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will implement SFAS 123(R) in the reporting period starting January 1, 2006. We expect that SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on our financial statements. At the present time, we have not yet determined which valuation method we will use. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, which amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the provisions of SFAS 151 will have a significant impact on our results of operations. 82 Table of Contents Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Controls and Procedures We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2005. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of that period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports. We have not made any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a companys board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. 83 Table of Contents Based on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F 51 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See the sections from Item 1A Risk Factors entitled We are Subject to Market Risk, Our Financial Position, Results of Operations and Cash Flows can be Affected by Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, and We are Exposed to Risk of Interest Rate Fluctuations.
