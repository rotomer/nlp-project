Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Information In addition to historical information, this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in our forward looking statements. You can identify our forward looking statements by our use of words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, plan, project, target, will and other words and terms of similar meaning. You also can identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding the anticipated level of future product sales, royalty revenues, expenses and profits, regulatory approvals, our long term growth, the development and marketing of additional products, the impact of competitive products, the anticipated outcome of pending or anticipated litigation and patent related proceedings, our ability to meet our manufacturing needs, the value of investments in certain marketable securities, and our plans to spend additional capital on external business development and research opportunities. Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors in Part I of this report and elsewhere in this report. Unless required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K, beginning on page F 1. Overview Biogen Idec Inc. was formed in 2003 upon the acquisition of Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceutical Corporation in a merger transaction, or the Merger. Biogen Idec Inc. is an international biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in oncology, neurology, immunology and other specialty areas of unmet medical need. We currently have five products: AVONEX (interferon beta 1a); RITUXAN (rituximab); TYSABRI (natalizumab); FUMADERM (dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts); and, ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan). During the third quarter of 2006, we began executing a plan to divest our ZEVALIN product line. Additionally, through April 2006, we recorded product revenues from sales of AMEVIVE (alefacept). In April 2006, we sold the worldwide rights to this product to Astellas Pharma US, Inc., or Astellas. We will continue to manufacture and supply this product to Astellas for a period of up to 11 years. Under the terms of the supply agreement, we charge Astellas fixed amounts based on volume. Such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and are not expected to be significant. Significant Events The significant events that occurred during 2006 were as follows: Reintroduction of TYSABRI: TYSABRI was reapproved for sale in the United States and approved for sale in Europe in June 2006. No product was shipped or revenue recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2006, but we began shipping product and recognizing revenue from TYSABRI sales of product in the third quarter of 2006. Acquisition of Fumapharm AG, or Fumapharm: In June 2006, we completed the acquisition of Fumapharm. The most significant financial statement impact resulting from this purchase was the recognition of an 44 Table of Contents acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D, charge of approximately $207.4 million. The charge was offset by a gain of $34.2 million on the settlement of a pre existing associated license agreement. Acquisition of Conforma Therapeutics Corporation, or Conforma: In May 2006, we completed the acquisition of Conforma. The most significant financial statement impact resulting from this purchase was the recognition of an IPR&D charge of approximately $123.1 million. Sale of AMEVIVE: As noted above, in April 2006, we sold the worldwide rights to AMEVIVE, including inventory on hand, to Astellas. Planned divestiture of ZEVALIN: During the third quarter of 2006, we began executing a plan to divest our ZEVALIN product line. Collaborations and Other Agreements: During the third quarter of 2006 we entered into collaboration agreements with mondoBIOTECH AG, or mondo, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, and UCB, S.A., or UCB. Upfront payments made or payable under the collaboration agreements totaled $42.5 million, all of which have been expensed as research and development expense during 2006. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2006, we entered into settlement agreements with Fumedica Arzneimittel AG and Fumedica Arzneimittel GmbH, collectively, Fumedica. A loss of $28.1 million was recognized in connection with one of the agreements. We sold other non core assets, including: NICO In February 2006, we sold our clinical manufacturing facility, known as NICO; and Bio 1 In December 2006, we sold a research facility, known as Bio 1, and recognized a pre tax gain of $15.6 million. Outlook Most of our revenues are currently dependent on two products: AVONEX and RITUXAN. In the near term, we are dependent on the successful reintroduction of TYSABRI to grow our overall revenues and diversify our product offerings. In the longer term, our revenue growth is dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of current pipeline products and in licensed or acquired products and programs. We expect to use our cash, cash equivalents and investments for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of businesses, products, product rights, or technologies. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of revenue growth in 2007 and beyond, such as the degree of market acceptance, the impact of competition, the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop, receive approval for and successfully launch our near term product candidates. Marketed Products Continued growth of global AVONEX sales is dependent on maintaining AVONEXs position as the most prescribed multiple sclerosis, or MS, therapy in the U.S. and growing AVONEX market share outside the U.S. In both the U.S. and globally, we face increasing competition in the MS market from currently marketed products and future products in late stage development. We continue to generate data showing AVONEX to be an effective and safe choice for MS patients and physicians. The majority of RITUXAN sales are currently from use in the oncology setting. We believe there is additional room for RITUXAN sales growth in oncology, particularly in the so called maintenance setting of Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, or NHL, approved in 2006. However, we believe a more significant driver of revenue growth in the future will be the immunology setting, where RITUXAN is currently indicated for anti TNF (tumor necrosis factor), refractory rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, patients. Additional immunology indications for RITUXAN we are investigating include earlier stage disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs RA, or DMARD refractory RA, MS and lupus. 45 Table of Contents The U.S. and European TYSABRI launches are underway. After establishing the TOUCH risk minimization action plan, or RiskMAP, program in the U.S. and providing extensive safety education in the U.S. and Europe, we are now positioned to deliver the strong efficacy message to the market. Successful reintroduction and sales growth will be dependent on acceptance by physicians and MS patients. Clinical Studies Over the past few years, we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels. For 2007, we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures. Three pipeline products have advanced to late stage registrational trials: BG 12 for relapsing forms of MS in Phase III; galiximab for NHL in Phase III; and lumiliximab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, in Phase IIb. In addition to the expense associated with these late stage trials, other pipeline products are expected to enter proof of concept trials in 2007, driving additional research and development expense. Manufacturing, Selling and Marketing Efforts In 2007, we expect to incur significant expenditures associated with manufacturing, selling and marketing our products. The aggregate amount of our sales and marketing expenses in 2007 will likely be higher than that incurred in 2006, primarily as a result of higher expenses for the ongoing TYSABRI launch in the U.S. and Europe. Business Development As part of our business strategy, we plan to consider and, as appropriate, make acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies. Our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions, and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions. In addition, as a result of our acquisition efforts, we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses (whether or not our efforts are successful) that may include transaction costs, closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges. Other We may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of: product revenues; cost of product sales; collaboration revenues; cost and timing of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product approvals; marketing and other expenses; manufacturing or supply disruptions; and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies. 46 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Product Revenues United States $ 1,069,492 40.0 % $ 997,671 41.2 % $ 986,050 44.6 % Rest of world 711,821 26.5 % 619,333 25.5 % 500,294 22.6 % Total product revenues 1,781,313 66.5 % 1,617,004 66.7 % 1,486,344 67.2 % Unconsolidated Joint Business 810,864 30.2 % 708,881 29.3 % 615,743 27.8 % Other Revenue Royalties 86,231 3.1 % 93,193 3.9 % 98,945 4.5 % Corporate partner 4,641 0.2 % 3,422 0.1 % 10,530 0.5 % Total other revenue 90,872 3.3 % 96,615 4.0 % 109,475 5.0 % Total revenues $ 2,683,049 100.0 % $ 2,422,500 100 % $ 2,211,562 100.0 % Product Revenues Revenues by product for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 AVONEX $ 1,706,719 95.9 % $ 1,543,085 95.4 % $ 1,417,157 95.3 % TYSABRI 35,831 2.0 % 4,656 0.3 % 3,121 0.2 % AMEVIVE 11,524 0.6 % 48,457 3.0 % 43,030 3.0 % ZEVALIN 17,767 1.0 % 20,806 1.3 % 23,036 1.5 % FUMADERM 9,472 0.5 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Total product revenues $ 1,781,313 100.0 % $ 1,617,004 100.0 % $ 1,486,344 100.0 % AVONEX Revenues from AVONEX for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 AVONEX U.S. $ 1,022,210 59.9 % $ 938,672 60.8 % $ 922,572 65.1 % Rest of world 684,509 40.1 % 604,413 39.2 % 494,585 34.9 % Total AVONEX revenues $ 1,706,719 100.0 % $ 1,543,085 100.0 % $ 1,417,157 100.0 % For 2006 compared to 2005, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased $83.5 million, or 8.9%, due principally to the impact of price increases and a reduction in discounts associated with the introduction of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. These increases were offset by lower volume. For 2006 compared to 2005, international sales of AVONEX increased $80.1 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to increases in volume and price, including the impact of patient mix. Foreign exchange accounted for a 0.6% increase in reported revenues; on a local currency basis, international sales increased 12.7%. For 2005 compared to 2004, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased $16.1 million, or 1.7%, due to price increases, offset by lower volume. For 2005 compared to 2004, international sales of AVONEX increased $109.8 million, or 22.2%, primarily due to increases in volume and price, including the impact of patient mix. Foreign exchange accounted for a 2.1% increase in reported revenues; on a local currency basis, international sales increased 20.1%. 47 Table of Contents We expect to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace in and outside the U.S. from existing and new MS treatments, including TYSABRI, which may impact sales of AVONEX. We expect future sales of AVONEX to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. TYSABRI Revenues from TYSABRI for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 TYSABRI U.S. $ 25,865 72.2 % $ 4,656 100.0 % $ 3,121 100.0 % Rest of world 9,966 27.8 % Total TYSABRI revenues $ 35,831 100.0 % $ 4,656 100.0 % $ 3,121 100.0 % Under the terms of a collaboration agreement with Elan Corporation plc, or Elan, we manufacture TYSABRI and collaborate with Elan on the products marketing, commercial distribution and on going development activities. We recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. upon Elans shipment of the product to third party distributors. We recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI outside the U.S. at the time of product delivery to our customers. In November 2004, TYSABRI was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. In 2005, our net revenue associated with sales of TYSABRI was $4.7 million, which consisted of revenue of $15.1 million from sales that occurred prior to our voluntary suspension, offset by an allowance for sales returns of $10.4 million related to returns of product sold prior to the suspension. On June 5, 2006, the FDA approved a supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, for the reintroduction of TYSABRI as a monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of MS to slow the progression of disability and reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. On June 29, 2006, we and Elan announced that the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, had approved TYSABRI as a similar treatment. In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in both the United States and Europe. In 2006, we have recorded revenue on sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. and Europe relating to current activity of $11.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Prior to the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005, we shipped product to Elan in the U.S. and recognized revenue in accordance with the policy described above. As a result of the suspension of TYSABRI, we had deferred $14.0 million in revenue related to TYSABRI product that remained in Elans ending inventory. This amount was paid by Elan during 2005 and was subsequently recognized as revenue during 2006, as the uncertainty about the ultimate disposition of the product was eliminated. AMEVIVE In 2006, 2005 and 2004, sales of AMEVIVE were $11.5 million, $48.5 million, and $43.0 million, respectively, of which $5.0 million, $34.9 million, and $41.6 million, respectively, was generated in the U.S. The decrease in total AMEVIVE sales for 2006 compared to 2005 was due to the sale, in April 2006, of our worldwide rights and infrastructure related to sales, production, and marketing of AMEVIVE. The increase in sales in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher sales volumes. Although we sold the rights to this product, we continue to report a small amount of product revenues related to shipments made by certain of our overseas joint ventures. ZEVALIN In 2006, 2005, and 2004 sales of ZEVALIN were $17.8 million, $20.8 million, and $23.0 million, respectively, of which $16.4 million, $19.4 million and $18.7 million, respectively, were generated in the U.S. 48 Table of Contents FUMADERM FUMADERM is a new product being sold by us for the first time beginning in the third quarter of 2006. This product line was acquired in our acquisition of Fumapharm in June 2006. Sales for 2006 were $9.5 million, all of which were generated in Germany. Provisions for Discounts and Allowances Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, typically upon delivery. Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration, or VA, rebates, managed care, patient assistance, product returns and other applicable allowances. The estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent significant judgments that we make with regard to revenue recognition. Provisions for discounts and allowances reduced gross product revenues as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Discounts $ 102.9 $ 106.5 $ 78.0 Contractual adjustments 93.3 93.8 75.3 Returns 38.7 26.0 18.7 Total allowances $ 234.9 $ 226.3 $ 172.0 Gross product revenues $ 2,016.2 $ 1,843.3 $ 1,658.3 Percent of gross product revenues 11.7 % 12.3 % 10.4 % Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. Product revenue reserves are categorized as follows: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns. Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives and patient assistance. For 2006 compared to 2005, discounts decreased $3.6 million, or 3.4%, reflecting lower amounts of AVONEX distributed through our patient assistance program. For 2005 compared to 2004, discounts increased $28.5 million, or 36.5%, due, principally, to patient assistance providing AVONEX at higher levels for patients that had been using TYSABRI prior to its suspension. Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid rebates, VA rebates and managed care. For 2006 compared to 2005, contractual adjustments were constant reflecting more activity in the managed care markets, offset by a reduction in Medicaid activity due to the introduction of Medicare Part D, the expanded prescription drug benefit program. For 2005 compared to 2004, contractual adjustments increased $18.5 million, or 24.6% due, principally, to the impact of higher reserves for managed care (associated with higher level of activity with respect to rebates) and Medicaid programs (associated with price increases). Product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers and patients. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from our patients for various reasons. For 2006 compared to 2005, returns increased $12.7 million, or 48.8%, as a result of an adjustment of $6.9 million to increase reserve levels to correct prior period errors, and higher return experience in 2006. These increases were offset by the impact of returns made in connection with the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005. For 2005 compared to 2004, returns increased $7.3 million, or 39.0%, due, principally, to the expense of $9.7 million recorded in 2005 related to the suspension of TYSABRI. Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product. 49 Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an increase in our allowance for expired products of $12.3 million to correct for prior period errors. This increase in the allowance was recorded through an out of period reduction in net product revenue of $6.9 million and an increase in goodwill of $5.4 million. We identified and quantified the errors through an analysis of the historical rate for returns based on volumes of returns and the amount of credit granted to the returning distributors in past periods. At the time of Merger with Biogen, Inc. in 2003, Biogen, Inc. had understated its allowance for expired product by an estimated $5.4 million due to an incorrect methodology applied in calculating its reserve balance. Had we identified this error at the time of the Merger, the recorded goodwill would have been approximately $5.4 million higher than has been previously reflected. Biogen, Inc.s methodology was in error because it did not utilize known information in determining critical assumptions used in the basis of calculation. Our application of this incorrect methodology in the post Merger period resulted in understating this reserve by an additional $6.9 million. In all cases, the correctly calculated rate of return is less than one percent of related gross product revenues. We have determined that the out of period correction of this error in 2006 is not material to our reported results. Additionally, we have determined that the error at the merger date is not material to any prior period balance sheet amounts and the error in the post merger period is not material to any prior period reported results. Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenues We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, under a collaboration agreement between the parties. Under the collaboration agreement, we granted Genentech a worldwide license to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in multiple indications. In exchange for these worldwide rights, we have copromotion rights in the U.S. and a contractual arrangement under which Genentech shares a portion of the pretax U.S. copromotion profits of RITUXAN with us. This collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement, not through a joint venture or other legal entity. In June 2003, we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with Genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti CD20 antibodies targeting B cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of indications. In the U.S., we contribute resources to selling and the continued development of RITUXAN. Genentech is responsible for worldwide manufacturing of RITUXAN. Genentech also is responsible for the primary support functions for the commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. including selling and marketing, customer service, order entry, distribution, shipping and billing. Genentech also incurs the majority of continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Under the arrangement, we have a limited sales force as well as limited development activity. Under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between Genentech and F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd., or Roche, commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where Roche copromotes RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co Ltd., or Zenyaku. There is no direct contractual arrangement between us and Roche or Zenyaku. Revenue from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of pretax copromotion profits, which is calculated by Genentech, and includes consideration of our RITUXAN related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenue from sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Pre tax copromotion profit consists of U.S. sales of RITUXAN to third party customers net of discounts and allowances and less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses, and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula, which resets annually, is as follows: Biogen Idecs Share Copromotion Operating Profits of Copromotion Profits First $50 million 30 % Greater than $50 million 40 % In 2006, 2005, and 2004, the 40% threshold was met during the first quarter. For each calendar year or portion thereof following the approval date of the first new anti CD20 product, the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and other anti CD20 products sold by us and Genentech will change. (See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail). 50 Table of Contents Copromotion profits for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, consist of the following (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Product revenues, net $ 2,071,235 $ 1,831,528 $ 1,573,228 Costs and expenses 669,324 534,593 418,190 Copromotion profits $ 1,401,911 $ 1,296,935 $ 1,155,038 Biogen Idecs share of copromotion profits $ 555,764 $ 513,774 $ 457,025 Net sales of RITUXAN to third party customers in the U.S. recorded by Genentech for 2006 were approximately $2.1 billion compared to $1.8 billion in 2005 and $1.6 billion in 2004. The increase in 2006 is due, principally, to the approval by the FDA of RITUXAN for two new indications, RA, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and an increase in wholesale prices. The increase in 2005 from 2004 was due, principally, to increased market penetration in treatments of B cell NHLs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and increases in the wholesale price of RITUXAN. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, consist of the following (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Copromotion profits $ 555,764 $ 513,774 $ 457,025 Reimbursement of selling and development expenses 61,075 47,593 37,710 Royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. 194,025 147,514 121,008 $ 810,864 $ 708,881 $ 615,743 For 2006 compared to 2005, reimbursement of selling and development expenses increased $13.5 million, or 28.3%. For 2005 compared to 2004, such reimbursements increased $9.9 million, or 26.2%. In both cases the increase was due, principally, to the expansion of the oncology sales force and development costs we incurred related to the development of RITUXAN for RA. Our royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is based on Roche and Zenyakus net sales to third party customers and is recorded on a cash basis. Royalty revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 increased $46.5 million, or 31.5%, due to increased market penetration and increase in prices. Royalty revenues in 2005 compared to 2004 increased $26.5 million, or 21.9% due to increased sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S, offset by a $11.3 million royalty credit to Genentech in 2005. The royalty period with respect to all products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis. RITUXAN was launched in 1998 in most European countries and in 2001 in Japan. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of new anti CD20 products, if and when commercially available, as compared to royalty revenue received on sales of RITUXAN. Other Revenue Other revenues consist of the following (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Royalties $ 86,231 94.9 % $ 93,193 96.5 % $ 98,945 90.4 % Corporate partner 4,641 5.1 % 3,422 3.5 % 10,530 9.6 % $ 90,872 100.0 % $ 96,615 100.0 % $ 109,475 100.0 % 51 Table of Contents Royalty Revenue We receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control. Our royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. are included in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For 2006 compared to 2005, royalty revenue decreased $7.0 million, or 7.5%. For 2005 compared to 2004, royalty revenues decreased $5.8 million, or 5.8%. In both cases the decreases were due, principally, to decreases in sales levels of products under license and to the expiration of certain contracts. We receive royalties from Schering Plough Corporation, or Schering Plough, on sales of its alpha interferon products in the U.S. under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon patents and patent applications. Schering Plough sells its INTRON A (interferon alfa 2b) brand of alpha interferon in the U.S. for a number of indications, including the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Schering Plough also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of hepatitis C, including REBETRON Combination Therapy containing INTRON A and REBETOL (ribavirin, USP), PEG INTRON (peginterferon alfa 2b), a pegylated form of alpha interferon, and PEG INTRON in combination with REBETOL. Beginning in 2006, we no longer receive royalties on sales that are made in Italy. We hold several patents related to hepatitis B antigens produced by genetic engineering techniques. These antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis B infection. We receive royalties from sales of hepatitis B vaccines in several countries, including the U.S., from GlaxoSmithKline plc and Merck and Co. Inc. We have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis B rights, on an antigen by antigen and nonexclusive basis, to several diagnostic kit manufacturers, including Abbott Laboratories, the major worldwide marketer of hepatitis B diagnostic kits. We receive ongoing royalties on sales of ANGIOMAX (bivalirudin) by The Medicines Company, or TMC. TMC sells ANGIOMAX in the U.S. for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. TMC sells ANGIOMAX through distributors in Europe, Canada and Latin America. Sales levels, and accordingly, royalty revenues, increased during 2006. Finally, we hold several patents in Japan and Taiwan related to the production of synthetic Interleukin 2. Interleukin 2 is a substance made in the human body that stimulates the proliferation of suppressor cells and is used in the treatment of several types of cancer and chronic viral infections. Shionogi & Co., Ltd. pays us royalties for use of these patented production techniques. We anticipate that total royalty revenues in future years will continue to represent a lower proportion of our total revenues. Royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs. Corporate Partner Revenues Corporate partner revenues represent contract revenues and license fees. In 2004, we received a $10.0 million payment from Schering AG for the EMEA grant of marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the EU. The payment represented, in part, a milestone payment to compensate us for preparing, generating, and collecting data that was critical to the EMEA marketing approval process as to which we have no continuing involvement. 52 Table of Contents Costs and Expenses Costs and expenses are as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 274,383 12.3 % $ 373,614 17.1 % $ 554,319 25.6 % Research and development 718,390 32.0 % 747,671 34.2 % 685,872 31.6 % Selling, general and administrative 685,067 30.5 % 644,758 29.5 % 580,278 26.8 % Collaboration profit (loss) sharing (9,682 ) (0.4 )% Acquired in process research and development 330,520 14.7 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 266,998 11.9 % 302,305 13.8 % 347,677 16.0 % Facility impairments and (gain) loss on disposition, net (16,507 ) (0.7 )% 118,112 5.4 % (Gain) loss on termination of license agreements, net (6,140 ) (0.3 )% Total operating costs and expenses $ 2,243,029 100.0 % $ 2,186,460 100.0 % $ 2,168,146 100.0 % Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the following (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Cost of product revenues $ 270,023 98.4 % $ 369,198 98.8 % $ 548,702 99.0 % Cost of royalty revenues 4,360 1.6 % 4,416 1.2 % 5,617 1.0 % Cost of sales $ 274,383 100.0 % $ 373,614 100.0 % $ 554,319 100.0 % Cost of Product Revenues Cost of product revenues, included in cost of sales, by product are as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 AVONEX $ 234,696 86.9 % $ 228,476 61.9 % $ 479,976 87.5 % TYSABRI 5,328 2.0 % 23,935 6.5 % 17,283 3.1 % AMEVIVE 9,990 3.7 % 93,953 25.4 % 27,772 5.1 % ZEVALIN 16,159 6.0 % 22,834 6.2 % 19,014 3.5 % FUMADERM 3,165 1.2 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Other 685 0.2 % 4,657 0.8 % Cost of product revenues $ 270,023 100.0 % $ 369,198 100.0 % $ 548,702 100.0 % AVONEX For 2006 compared to 2005, cost of product revenue for AVONEX increased $6.2 million, or 2.7%, in line with increased sales levels but slightly lower as a percent of revenue due to lower costs associated with failures of quality specifications in 2006 compared to 2005. For 2005 compared to 2004, cost of product revenue decreased 53 Table of Contents $251.5 million, or 52.4%, due, principally, to the 2004 impact of the difference between the cost of AVONEX inventory recorded at the Merger date and its historical manufacturing cost. A substantial portion of this amount, $277.5 million, was recognized as cost of sales when the acquired inventory was sold or written down in 2004. All of the AVONEX inventory acquired in the Merger was sold or written off by December 31, 2004. TYSABRI Sales of TYSABRI resumed in July 2006 following FDA approval to reintroduce the product for certain indications. Because of the suspension in 2005, no product was shipped in 2005 subsequent to February 2005. The cost of product revenues for 2005 is due, principally, to write offs of inventory associated with the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005. The cost of goods sold in 2006 represents, principally, the cost of shipments made since July 2006 in the U.S. and Europe. We manufactured TYSABRI during the first and second quarter of 2005 and completed our scheduled production of TYSABRI during July 2005. Because of the uncertain future commercial availability of TYSABRI at the time, and our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that TYSABRI inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life, we expensed $23.2 million of costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI in the first quarter of 2005 to cost of product revenues. At the time of production, the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable. Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, as we worked with clinical investigators to understand the possible risks of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, we charged the costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense. As a result, we expensed $21.5 million related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense during 2005. At December 31, 2005, there was no carrying value of TYSABRI inventory on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2006, $41.3 million and $0.6 million of TYSABRI inventory value is included in work in process and finished goods, respectively. In addition, we have product on hand that was written down due to the uncertainties surrounding the TYSABRI suspension but which is available to fill future orders. The approximate value of such product, based on its cost of manufacture, was $36.9 million. As we sell TYSABRI, we are realizing lower than normal cost of sales and, therefore, higher margins, as we ship the inventory that was previously written down. For 2006, cost of sales was approximately $2.6 million lower due to the sale of TYSABRI that had been previously written off. AMEVIVE For 2006 compared to 2005, cost of product revenue for AMEVIVE decreased $84.0 million, or 89.4%, due to the disposition of our worldwide rights to the product in April 2006. For 2005 compared to 2004, cost of product revenue increased $66.2 million, or 238.1%. Of this increase, approximately $66.0 million represented the difference between the cost of AMEVIVE inventory recorded at the time of the Merger and its historical cost which was recognized as cost of product revenues when the inventory was sold or written off in 2005. Additionally, in connection with the divestiture of AMEVIVE we recorded charges of $31.8 million to write down AMEVIVE inventory to its net realizable value. This amount was entirely related to the inventory step up recorded at the time of the Merger. ZEVALIN For 2006 compared to 2005, cost of product revenue for ZEVALIN decreased $6.7 million, or 29.2%, due, principally, to the impairment of certain capitalized patents in 2005 and decline in sales volumes. For 2005 compared to 2004, cost of product revenue for ZEVALIN increased $3.8 million, or 20.0%, due to inventory write offs and impairments. FUMADERM Cost of product revenues for FUMADERM was $3.2 million, which includes the impact of an inventory fair value step up adjustment of $2.9 million in connection with purchase accounting for the Fumapharm acquisition during 2006. 54 Table of Contents Inventory Write Offs We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or that became obsolete due to dating expiration. In all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value. Included in cost of product revenues are inventory write downs as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 AVONEX $ 4,321 $ 11,986 $ 16,195 AMEVIVE 2,433 30,282 1,727 ZEVALIN 3,294 10,158 9,712 TYSABRI 2,941 23,205 19,103 $ 12,989 $ 75,631 $ 46,737 The write downs were the result of the following (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 New components for alternative presentations $ $ 8,417 $ Failed quality specifications 11,236 23,067 22,377 Excess and or obsolescence 1,753 20,942 5,257 Cost for voluntary suspension of TYSABRI 23,205 19,103 $ 12,989 $ 75,631 $ 46,737 In 2005, write downs of AVONEX inventory included $8.4 million for remaining supplies of the alternative presentations of AVONEX that were no longer needed after the FDA approved a new component for the pre filled syringe formulation of AVONEX in March 2005. The ZEVALIN inventory was written down when it was determined that it would not be marketable based on estimates of demand. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of $5.7 million to cost of product revenues related to an impairment of certain capitalized ZEVALIN patents, to reflect the adjustment to net realizable value. Cost of Royalty Revenues For 2006, 2005 and 2004, cost of royalty revenues were $4.4 million, $4.4 million, and $5.6 million, respectively. Gross margin on royalty revenues were approximately 95%, 95%, and 94%, respectively. We expect that gross margins on royalty revenues will fluctuate in the future based on changes in sales volumes for specific products from which we receive royalties. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses totaled $718.4 million in 2006 compared to $747.7 million in 2005 and $685.9 million in 2004. For 2006 compared to 2005, research and development expenses decreased $29.3 million, or 3.9%, due, principally, to: reductions in salary and benefit expense arising from headcount reductions in 2005 ($61.5 million); the elimination of costs related to the NIMO facility that was sold in the second quarter of 2005 ($20.0 million); and lower expenses for clinical trials, primarily related to TYSABRI and AMEVIVE ($23.0 million). These decreases were offset by an increase in expenses for new collaborations during the year ($11.2 million); higher clinical manufacturing expense ($10.8 million); and the impact of share based compensation recognized under SFAS 123(R) in 2006 ($51.5 million). 55 Table of Contents For 2006, share based compensation expense included in research and development, computed under APB 25, would have been $32.9 million. For 2005 compared to 2004, research and development expenses increased $61.8 million, or 9.0%, due, principally, to: upfront licensing fee and milestones related to a collaboration with PDL BioPharma, Inc., or PDL ($50.0 million); biopharmaceutical operations and global quality initiatives for our manufacturing activities, including expenses related to the manufacture of TYSABRI ($11.1 million); increased depreciation and infrastructure expenses ($16.7 million); discovery research initiatives ($7.1 million); and increased pre clinical research activities ($9.4 million). These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses for our ongoing clinical trials, primarily related to lower than expected clinical trial expenses for TYSABRI and AMEVIVE ($31.4 million). We expect that research and development expenses will increase in 2007 for a number of reasons, including our plans to commit significant additional investments in business development and research opportunities. Acquired In Process Research and Development, or IPR&D During the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we recorded expense related to IPR&D of $330.5 million. Of this amount, $207.4 million related to acquired IPR&D from the acquisition of Fumapharm and $123.1 million related to acquired IPR&D from the acquisition of Conforma. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Other Agreements, of the consolidated financial statements for details on future expenditures with respect to IPR&D. Since completing these acquisitions in the second quarter of 2006, we have spent $17.0 million related to the Fumapharm IPR&D, and $4.2 million on the Conforma IPR&D. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects are that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $685.1 million in 2006 compared to $644.8 million in 2005 and $580.3 million in 2004. For 2006 compared to 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40.3 million, or 6.3%, due, principally, to: higher expenses related to RITUXAN in RA ($21.5 million); increased expenses for the re launch of TYSABRI ($20.3 million); lower reimbursements of costs related to collaboration agreements ($4.3 million); and higher costs related to share based compensation recognized under SFAS 123(R) in 2006 ($45.2 million). These increases were offset by: lower expenses for AMEVIVE due to its divestiture ($31.0 million); a decrease in expenses for ZEVALIN ($20.0 million), due in part to the planned divestiture, and also due to the impact of a charge taken in 2005 related to a write down of remaining prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with MDS (Canada). For 2006, approximately $80.8 million of share based compensation is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R) in 2006. For 2006, share based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expense, computed under APB 25 would have been $51.5 million. For 2005 compared to 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $64.5 million, or 11.1%, due, principally, to: the neurology sales force expansion in the U.S. ($8.0 million); increased international neurology sales activities primarily in the EU ($10.6 million); customer service initiatives ($7.2 million); oncology sales and marketing initiatives primarily due to a charge of $12.9 million related to a write down of remaining prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with MDS (Canada) ($19.7 million). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our immunology sales and marketing programs largely due to the pending AMEVIVE divestiture ($7.4 million). Included in the increase of selling, general and administrative fees for 2005 56 Table of Contents were administrative expenses, primarily related to consulting fees and grants ($15.7 million), information technology primarily compensation and consulting costs ($8.6 million), and compensation and other costs associated with the retirement of our former Executive Chairman in December 2005 ($7.1 million). We anticipate that total selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2007 will be higher than 2006 due to sales and marketing and other general and administrative expenses to primarily support AVONEX and TYSABRI. Share based Payments Our share based compensation programs consist of share based awards granted to employees including stock options, restricted stock, performance share units and restricted stock units, or RSUs, as well as our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) Share based Payment, or SFAS 123(R). This Statement requires compensation cost relating to share based awards to be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value measurement method. Under the fair value method, the estimated fair value of awards is charged against income over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We selected the modified prospective method as prescribed in SFAS 123(R) and, therefore, prior periods were not restated. Under the modified prospective method, this Statement was applied to new awards granted in 2006, as well as to the unvested portion of previously granted equity based awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of December 31, 2005. The fair value of performance based stock units is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level will be achieved. Compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the outcome of performance related conditions until the vesting date. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded share based compensation expense of $126.8 million associated with the SFAS 123(R) adoption. This expense is net of a cumulative effect pre tax adjustment of $5.6 million, or $3.8 million after tax. The cumulative effect results from the application of an estimated forfeiture rate for current and prior period unvested restricted stock awards. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded share based compensation expense of $36.9 million. Severance and Other Restructuring Costs 2005 Strategic Plan In September 2005, we began implementing a comprehensive strategic plan, or the 2005 Strategic Plan, in conjunction with which we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management layers and staff functions, resulting in the reduction of our workforce that represented approximately 17%, or approximately 650 positions worldwide at that time. These adjustments took place across company functions, departments and sites, and were substantially implemented by the end of 2005. We recorded restructuring charges of $31.4 million in connection with these activities, of which $28.3 million related to severance and other employee termination costs, including health benefits, outplacement and bonuses. Other costs were $3.1 million and included write downs of certain research assets that will no longer be utilized, consulting costs in connection with the restructuring effort, and costs related to the acceleration of restricted stock, offset by the reversal of previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted stock cancellations. 2006 Restructurings During 2006, we incurred additional restructuring costs associated with acquisitions and planned dispositions. We incurred $1.2 million in severance costs associated with the acquisition of Conforma during 2006 and $1.7 million related in headcount reductions related to the planned disposition of our ZEVALIN product line. For 2006, $3.6 million of restructuring charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Costs not yet paid as of December 31, 2006, were $2.1 million, and are included in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 21, Severance and Other Restructuring Costs, of the consolidated financial statements, for details on the change in reserve levels related to severance. 57 Table of Contents We may have additional charges in future periods. The amount of those future charges cannot be determined at this time. Other On December 16, 2005, Dr. William H. Rastetter, our former Executive Chairman, entered into a letter agreement confirming Dr. Rastetters retirement as Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board and his resignation from the Board, all effective as of December 30, 2005. As a result, Dr. Rastetter was entitled to, among other things, payments equal to his 2005 target bonus and three times the sum of his annual salary and target bonus, immediate vesting of his unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. These charges related to Dr. Rastetters retirement amounted to $7.1 million, and no liability related to Dr. Rastetters retirement remains. In 2004, we recorded charges of $4.4 million related to severance obligations for certain employees affected by the Merger in our San Diego facilities, $2.3 million of restructuring costs related to the relocation of our European headquarters, and $1.0 million related to severance obligations for certain employees affected by the Merger in our Cambridge facilities. At December 31, 2006, we have no significant remaining liabilities related to the 2004 obligations. Facility Impairments and (Gain) Loss on Disposition, net As of March 31, 2005, after our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark. Additionally, we added a labeling and packaging component to the project, but determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of the large scale biological manufacturing facility. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6.2 million in 2005 related to the fill finish component that had previously been capitalized. In June 2005, we sold our large scale biologics manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known as NIMO, along with approximately 60 acres of real property located in Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is located, together with improvements, related property rights, and certain personal property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real property. Total consideration for the sale was $408.1 million. The loss from this transaction was $83.5 million which consisted primarily of the write down of NIMO to net selling price, sales and transfer taxes, and other associated transaction costs. In February 2006, we sold our clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known as NICO. The assets associated with the facility were included in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. Total consideration was $29.0 million. In 2005, we recorded impairment charges totaling $28.0 million to reduce the carrying value of NICO to its net realizable value. No additional loss resulted from completion of the sale. In December 2006, we completed the sale of one of the buildings in our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility, known as Bio 1. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $39.5 million. We recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $15.6 million on the sale. We will continue to occupy a minor portion of the building through December 31, 2007 under a leasing arrangement and have recorded prepaid rent of approximately $0.7 million at December 31, 2006, representing our future commitment under the leaseback arrangement. Gain (Loss) on Settlement of License Agreements, net Fumapharm During 2006, we recorded a gain of $34.2 million coincident with the acquisition of Fumapharm in accordance with EITF 04 1, Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination. The gain related to the settlement of a preexisting collaboration agreement between Fumapharm and us. The collaboration agreement had been entered into in October 2003 and required payments to Fumapharm of certain royalty amounts. The market rate for such payments was determined to have been higher at the acquisition date due, principally, to the increased technical feasibility of BG 12. The gain relates to the difference between the royalty rates at the time 58 Table of Contents the agreement was entered into as compared to the rates at the time the agreement was effectively settled by virtue of our acquisition of Fumapharm. Fumedica During 2006, we recorded a charge of $28.1 million in connection with a settlement agreement with Fumedica. The charge related to the settlement of the agreement with Fumedica under which we were contingently obligated to make royalty payments with respect to a successful launch of BG 12 for psoriasis in Germany. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we will not be required to make any royalty payments to Fumedica if BG 12 is successfully launched for psoriasis in Germany. The $28.1 million amount has been expensed as it relates to a product that has not reached technological feasibility. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, is as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Interest income $ 101,219 $ 62,751 $ 57,225 Interest expense (871 ) (9,647 ) (18,898 ) Other income (expense), net (48,205 ) (32,949 ) (17,650 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 52,143 $ 20,155 $ 20,677 Interest Income For 2006 compared to 2005, interest income increased $38.5 million, or 61.3%, due, principally to higher levels of cash and marketable securities. For 2005 compared to 2004, interest income increased $5.5 million, or 9.7% due, principally, to higher yields. Interest Expense For 2006 compared to 2005, interest expense decreased $8.8 million, or 91.0%, due to the repurchase of our senior notes due in 2032 in the second quarter of 2005. For 2005 compared to 2004, interest expense decreased $9.3 million, or 49.0%, due to the repurchase of our senior notes in the second quarter of 2005 and lower amortization of the issuance costs related to the senior notes. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, included the following (in thousands): December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Impairments of investments $ (34,424 ) $ (15,432 ) $ (18,482 ) Foreign exchange gains (losses), net 4,870 (8,695 ) 5,353 Loss on sales of investments, net (2,782 ) (8,403 ) (4,090 ) Minority interest (6,770 ) Settlement of litigation and claims (4,601 ) (2,113 ) Other, net (4,498 ) 1,694 (431 ) Total other income (expense), net $ (48,205 ) $ (32,949 ) $ (17,650 ) The impairment of investment is due, principally, to the other than temporary impairments in our strategic investments portfolio. We may incur additional charges on these investments in the future. 59 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangible Assets For 2006, 2005 and 2004, amortization expense was $267.0 million, $302.3 million and $347.7 million, respectively. For 2006 compared to 2005, amortization expense decreased $35.3 million, or 11.7%, due, principally, to the impact of a change in amortization for core technology in accordance with our policy from economic consumption in 2005 to the straight line method in the third quarter of 2006. This change accounted for a decrease of approximately $18 million. Additionally, approximately $5 million of the decrease relates to the impact of lower amortization as a result of the revised economic consumption forecast for 2006 versus 2005 that impacted the first six months of 2006. Additionally, in 2005, a charge of $7.9 million had been recorded to write down certain core technology intangible assets to net realizable value. As of September 30, 2006, in connection with the establishment of our annual Long Range Plan, we reforecasted the economic consumption of AVONEX, based on our revised forecasts of future sales. Additionally, based on our policy, we began to calculate amortization under the straight line method as it resulted in a greater amount than the amount computed under the economic use method. The straight line calculation will be applied until our remeasurement in conjunction with the 2008 Long Range Plan in the third quarter of 2007. For 2005 compared to 2004, amortization expense decreased $45.4 million, or 13.1%, due, principally, to a change in estimate in the calculation of economic consumption for core technology, offset by a $8.0 million charge to write down certain core technology intangible assets to net realizable value in 2005. In the third quarter of 2005, we completed a review of our business opportunities in each of the relevant commercial markets in which our products are sold and determined their expected profitability. As a result of this review, in the third quarter of 2005, management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain technology intangible assets related to future sales of AVONEX in Japan may not be recoverable. As a result, we recorded a charge of approximately $7.9 million to amortization of acquired intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of technology intangible assets related to AVONEX. In the third quarter of 2004, management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE may not be recoverable. As a result, in the third quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $27.8 million to amortization of acquired intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to AMEVIVE. We review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations. 60 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision Tax Rate A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending December 31 is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State taxes 3.0 1.9 2.8 Foreign taxes (16.3 ) (18.8 ) (49.3 ) Credits and net operating loss utilization (0.6 ) 0.2 (9.0 ) Other 0.6 1.2 2.1 Fair value adjustment 6.2 13.8 74.8 IPR&D 27.9 Non deductible items 0.8 (0.3 ) 4.5 Tax on repatriation 4.3 Effective tax rate 56.6 % 37.3 % 60.9 % Our effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate due, principally, to the impact of foreign taxes, fair value adjustments, and IPR&D. The fair value adjustments relate to the impact of the tax treatment of the amortization of acquired intangible assets in foreign jurisdictions. Foreign taxes adjustments relate, principally, to the impact of significantly lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The impact of IPR&D relate to the write off of IPR&D in connection with the acquisitions of Conforma and Fumapharm, which was non deductible for income tax purposes. We have tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income. The utilization of our tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the Internal Revenue Code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than 50% in prior years. However, we anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net tax credits. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax liabilities and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are either tax deductible or to which our tax credits may be carried, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the entire benefits of our deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations in that period. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Act, was signed into law. The Act created a temporary incentive, which expired on December 31, 2005, for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. at an effective tax rate that could be as low as 5.25%. On December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB issued FASB staff position 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or FSP 109 2. FSP 109 2 allowed companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the law on whether unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to qualify for SFAS 109s exception to recognizing deferred tax liabilities. We completed our evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2005 and decided to take advantage of this temporary tax incentive. A total distribution of $196.0 million was made by one of our foreign subsidiaries to one of our U.S. subsidiaries in December 2005. We incurred a charge to our consolidated results of operations of $11.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 for the tax cost related to the distribution. The Act also provides a deduction for domestic manufacturing, which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 1.3% for 2005. We estimate that the deduction will reduce our effective tax rate by a higher amount in future years, as the deduction is phased in. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, completed its examination of legacy Biogen, Inc.s, now Biogen Idec MA, Inc.s, consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and issued an assessment. We subsequently paid the majority of the amounts assessed and are appealing one issue. As a result of this and other income tax audit activity, Biogen Idec MA, Inc. reassessed its liability for income 61 Table of Contents tax contingencies to reflect the IRS findings and recorded a $13.8 million reduction in these liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2005. The corresponding effects of the adjustments to the liability for income tax contingencies through 2004 resulted in a reduction in goodwill of $20.7 million for amounts related to periods prior to the Merger and an increase in income tax expense associated with continuing operations of $6.9 million in 2005. Contingency On September 12, 2006, we received a Notice of Assessment from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for $38.9 million, including penalties and interest, with respect to the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustment and will vigorously oppose the assessment. We believe that the assessment does not impact the level of our liabilities for income taxes. However, there is a possibility that we may not prevail in all of our assertions. If this is resolved unfavorably in the future based on facts and conditions currently not available to us, this could have a material impact on our future effective tax rate and our results of operations in the period, or periods, in which an event would occur. FIN 48 Assessment We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, on our financial statements. Financial Condition We have financed our operating and investing activities principally through cash flows from our operations. We expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash from operations, as well as existing cash resources. We believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we may, from time to time, seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. Our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including: the continued commercial success of AVONEX and RITUXAN; the commercial success of TYSABRI; the timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development; the cost of launching new products, and the success of those products; funding and timing of payments related to several significant capital projects; the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing; fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs; levels of resources that we need to devote to the development of manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities, including resources devoted to the marketing of AVONEX, RITUXAN, FUMADERM, TYSABRI and future products; technological advances; status of products being developed by competitors; our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations; working capital required to satisfy the options of holders of our senior notes and subordinated notes who may require us to repurchase their notes on specified terms or upon the occurrence of specified events. In connection with the strategic plan that we announced in September 2005, we intend to commit significant additional capital to external research and development opportunities. To date, we have financed our external growth initiatives through existing cash resources. We expect to finance our future growth initiative requirements either through existing cash resources or a combination of existing cash resources and debt financings. 62 Table of Contents Until required for operations, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, foreign and U.S. government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 661,377 $ 568,168 Marketable securities available for sale 1,653,552 1,486,963 $ 2,314,929 $ 2,055,131 Operating activities In 2006, 2005, and 2004, net cash provided by operations was $841.3 million, $889.5 million, $728.0 million, respectively. For 2006 compared to 2005, net cash provided by operations decreased $48.2 million or 5.4%. The decrease in cash provided by operations is primarily attributable to increases in asset accounts and reduction in liabilities, offset by higher earnings. Specifically, cash used to finance movements in working capital accounts gave rise to a use of funds in the current year of $96.5 million as compared to a source of funds of $139.8 million in the prior year. The current year includes higher non cash expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005. The principal components of the increase in non cash charges were acquired in process research and development of $330.5 million related to the 2006 acquisitions of Fumapharm and Conforma, offset by a decrease in impairments expense of $134.6 million for 2006 as compared to 2005. For 2005 compared to 2004, net cash provided by operations increased $161.5 million or 22.2%. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in non cash impairment expense of $115.5 million offset by increases in asset accounts and reduction in liabilities. Specifically, cash used to finance movements in working capital asset and liability accounts gave rise to a source of funds in 2005 of $139.8 million as compared to a source of funds in 2004 of $258.7 million. Investing activities In 2006, 2005, and 2004 investing activities were a net source (use) of cash of ($599.8) million, $417.7 million and ($382.4) million, respectively. In 2006, our major uses of cash for investing activities were for the acquisitions of Fumapharm and Conforma of approximately $363.3 million, net purchases of marketable securities of $162.8 million, and net property, plant and equipment additions of $124.1 million offset by proceeds from the disposition of AMEVIVE of $59.8 million. In 2005, our major sources of cash consisted of $408.1 million of proceeds from the sale of our Oceanside, California manufacturing facility. Additionally, approximately $447.9 million of net cash was provided from proceeds from sales of marketable securities. We sold marketable securities in the second quarter of 2005 to fund the repurchase of our senior notes, discussed below. Cash used for investing activities consisted of $318.4 million to fund construction projects and purchase property and equipment, including our research and development and administration campus in San Diego and manufacturing facility in Oceanside, and $119.9 million for investments in marketable securities of PDL, Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sunesis, and other strategic investments. In 2004, the major use of cash was acquisitions of property plant and equipment of $361.0 million. Financing activities In 2006, 2005, and 2004, net cash used in financing activities was $148.4 million, $948.5, and $451.0 million, respectively. In 2006, the primary use of cash was $320.3 million for repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program, offset by $147.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock in connection with stock based compensation arrangements. The primary uses of cash in 2005 were for the repurchase of senior notes 63 Table of Contents of $746.4 million and $322.6 million for repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program, offset by $119.6 million for issuance of treasury stock in connection with stock based compensation arrangements. In 2004, the major use of cash was for the purchase of treasury stock of $734.4 million offset by cash inflows from the issuance of both common and treasury stock for stock based compensation arrangements of $273.5 million. In April and May 2002, we raised approximately $696 million through the issuance of our senior notes, net of underwriting commissions and expenses of $18.4 million. The senior notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of 1.75% annually. On April 29, 2005, holders of 99.2% of the outstanding senior notes exercised their right under the indenture governing the senior notes to require us to repurchase their senior notes. On May 2, 2005, we paid $746.4 million in cash to repurchase those senior notes with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately $1.2 billion. The purchase price for the senior notes was $624.73 in cash per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, and was based on the requirements of the indenture and the senior notes. Additionally, we made a cash payment in 2005 of approximately $62 million for the payment of tax related to additional deductible interest expense for which deferred tax liabilities had been previously established. As of December 31, 2006, our remaining indebtedness under the senior notes was approximately $10.2 million at maturity. In February 1999, we raised approximately $113 million through the issuance of our subordinated notes, net of underwriting commissions and expenses of $3.9 million. The subordinated notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of 5.5% annually. Upon maturity, the subordinated notes would have had an aggregate principal face value of $345.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, our remaining indebtedness under the subordinated notes was approximately $75.4 million at maturity, due to conversion of subordinated notes into common stock. Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value subordinated note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into 40.404 shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $8.36 per share. During 2005, holders of the subordinated notes with a face value of approximately $143.8 million elected to convert their subordinated notes to approximately 5.8 million shares of our common stock. The remaining holders of the subordinated notes may require us to purchase the subordinated notes on February 16, 2009 or 2014 at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase with us having the option to repay the subordinated notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock. Biogen Dompe In October 2006, Biogen Dompe SRL, or the joint venture, a consolidated joint venture in which we are a 50% partner, obtained a 24 million Euros line of credit from us and Domp Farmaceutici SpA, or Domp, at a rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 25 basis points. The interest rate is reset quarterly and payable quarterly in arrears. As of December 31, 2006, the balance of the joint venture loan was 18 million Euros ($23.8 million), half of which has been eliminated as it is an intercompany loan for purposes of presenting our consolidated financial position. Borrowings are to be made equally between the partners, and any repayments are to be paid in a similar manner. The loan replaced a previous advance that had been made by Dompe. Any borrowings on the line of credit are due June 1, 2009. Notes Payable to Fumedica In December 2006, in connection with the settlement of various agreements associated with Fumedica, we entered into two notes payable, the aggregate amount of which, at present value, was 47.7 million Swiss Francs ($39.2 million). The notes are non interest bearing, are being accreted at a rate of 5.75% and are payable in a series of payments over the period from 2008 to 2018. (See Note 2, Acquisitions and Other Agreements, of the consolidated financial statements). Commitments In August 2004, we restarted construction of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark. In March 2005, after our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark. Additionally, we added a labeling and packaging component to the project. We 64 Table of Contents also determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of that facility. The original cost of the revised project was expected to be $372.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had committed approximately $304.4 million to the project, of which $275.3 million had been paid. The administrative building is already in use. The lab facility and the label and packaging facility were substantially completed in 2006 and will be licensed for operation in 2007. The second phase of the project, a large scale manufacturing facility, is expected to be completed in 2008. In October 2006, our Board of Directors approved the second phase of the project, which is expected to cost an additional $225.0 million. In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. This repurchase program expired October 4, 2006. During 2006, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of $320.3 million. During 2005, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of $324.3 million. In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 20.0 million shares of our common stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as common stock to be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase plans. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. No shares have been repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2006. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding contingent milestone payments totaling $1.5 billion under our collaboration and license agreements, and construction commitments disclosed separately under Financial Condition) at December 31, 2006, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 3 4 5 After Years 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Non cancelable operating leases $ 101,900 $ 24,252 $ 32,152 $ 22,340 $ 23,156 Notes payable 96,694 29,478 10,128 57,088 Other long term obligations 39,001 17,782 13,669 7,550 Total contractual cash obligations $ 237,595 $ 42,034 $ 75,299 $ 40,018 $ 80,244 All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We do not have any other significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Additionally, holders of our subordinated notes may elect to convert their notes into shares of our common stock at any time. Collaboration and License Agreements In connection with our research and development efforts, we have entered into various collaboration arrangements which provide us with rights to develop, produce and market products using certain know how, technology and patent rights maintained by the parties. Terms of the various license agreements may require us to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product development objectives and pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. See Note 15, Research Collaborations and Strategic Investments, to the consolidated financial statements. Legal Matters See Note 18, Litigation, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of legal matters as of December 31, 2006. Subsequent Events See Note 26, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements. 65 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to: product revenue and related allowances; royalty revenues; marketable securities and other investments; inventory; income taxes; research and development; in process research and development; derivative and hedging activities; long lived assets; goodwill; contingencies and litigation; and share based payments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about revenue and expense recognition and carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Product Revenues We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured; and title and the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer. Except for revenues from sales of TYSABRI in the U.S., revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery. Sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. are recognized on the sell through model, that is, upon shipment of the product by Elan to its third party distributors. Revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration, or VA rebates, managed care, patient assistance, product returns and other applicable allowances and the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments that we make with regard to revenue recognition. 66 Table of Contents Provisions for discounts and allowances reduced gross product revenues were as follows (in million): 2006 2005 2004 Discounts $ 102.9 $ 106.5 $ 78.0 Contractual adjustments 93.3 93.8 75.3 Returns 38.7 26.0 18.7 Total allowances $ 234.9 $ 226.3 $ 172.0 Gross product revenues $ 2,016.2 $ 1,843.3 $ 1,658.3 Percent of gross product revenues 11.7 % 12.3 % 10.4 % An analysis of the amount of, and change in, reserves is as follows (in millions): Contractual Discounts Adjustments Returns Total 2006 Beginning Balance $ 11.6 $ 35.7 $ 2.3 $ 49.6 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 102.9 96.4 31.6 230.9 Adjustments relating to prior years (3.1 ) 7.1 4.0 Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (90.2 ) (63.1 ) (16.1 ) (169.4 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (11.6 ) (35.4 ) (12.5 ) (59.5 ) Other adjustments 5.4 5.4 Ending Balance $ 12.7 $ 30.5 $ 17.8 $ 61.0 2005 Beginning Balance $ 7.8 $ 18.4 $ 5.2 $ 31.4 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 106.5 92.8 18.5 217.8 Adjustments relating to prior years 1.0 7.5 8.5 Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (94.9 ) (57.5 ) (16.2 ) (168.6 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (7.8 ) (19.0 ) (12.7 ) (39.5 ) Ending Balance $ 11.6 $ 35.7 $ 2.3 $ 49.6 2004 Beginning Balance $ 3.9 $ 17.2 $ 2.9 $ 24.0 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 78.0 76.0 14.8 168.8 Adjustments relating to prior years (0.7 ) 3.9 3.2 Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (70.2 ) (56.8 ) (9.6 ) (136.6 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (3.9 ) (17.3 ) (6.8 ) (28.0 ) Ending Balance $ 7.8 $ 18.4 $ 5.2 $ 31.4 Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. Product revenue reserves are categorized as follows: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns. Discounts Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives and patient assistance. 67 Table of Contents Trade term discounts and wholesaler incentive reserves primarily relate to estimated obligations for credits to be granted to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods and credits to be granted to wholesalers for compliance with various contractually defined inventory management practices, respectively. We determine these reserves based on our experience, including the timing of customer payments. Patient assistance reserves are established to cover no charge product that we distribute to qualifying patients under our indigent program, Patient Access. The program is administered through one of our distribution partners, who ship product for qualifying patients from their own inventory that was purchased from us. The distributor receives a credit at the end of each period for product that was administered during the period, and an accrual is established through a reduction of product revenues for sales made to the distributor which may be used to administer our patient assistance program. We determine this reserve based on our experience with the amount of activity under the program. Contractual Adjustments Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid rebates, VA rebates and managed care. Medicaid rebates reserves relate to our estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction to product sales revenue and the establishment of a liability. Rebate amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the state, and we generally make cash payments for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification from the state. VA rebates or chargeback reserves represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified health care providers at prices lower than the list prices we charge the wholesalers who provide them those products. The wholesaler charges us for the difference between what the wholesaler pays us for the products and the selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Rebate accruals are established in the same period as the related revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction in product revenue. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification from the wholesaler. Managed care reserves represent our estimated obligations to third parties, primarily pharmacy benefit managers. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction to product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in other accrued liabilities. These rebates result from performance based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates requires an estimate of the customers buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. In 2006, our estimates required an adjustment of $3.1 million relating to prior years. Returns Product return revenues are established for returns made by wholesalers and patients. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from our patients for various reasons. Revenues for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales. The patient return program is administered by the same distribution partner as the patient assistance program. Revenue related to product sold to this distribution partner that is used to satisfy patient returns is fully reserved. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product. As noted below, we have recorded adjustments to the amount of reserves for product returns. During the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an increase in our allowance for expired products of $12.3 million to correct for prior period errors. This increase in the allowance was recorded through an out of period 68 Table of Contents reduction in net product revenue of $6.9 million and an increase in goodwill of $5.4 million. We identified and quantified the errors through an analysis of the historical rate for returns based on volumes of returns and the amount of credit granted to the returning distributors in past periods. At the time of Merger with Biogen, Inc. in 2003, Biogen, Inc. had understated its allowance for expired product by an estimated $5.4 million due to an incorrect methodology applied in calculating its reserve balance. Had we identified this error at the time of the Merger, the recorded goodwill would have been approximately $5.4 million higher than has been previously reflected. Biogen, Inc.s methodology was in error because it did not utilize known information in determining critical assumptions used in the basis of calculation. Our application of this incorrect methodology in the post Merger period resulted in understating this reserve by an additional $6.9 million. In all cases, the correctly calculated rate of return is less than one percent of related gross product revenues. We have determined that the out of period correction of this error in 2006 is not material to our reported results. Additionally, we have determined that the error at the merger date is not material to any prior period balance sheet amounts and the error in the post merger period is not material to any prior period reported results. Other We closely monitor levels of inventory in our distribution channel. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately 2 weeks of inventory in our distribution channel. The shelf life associated with our products is, generally between 15 and 48 months, depending on the product. Obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern, given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel. Changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us. We do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business. Royalties We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which we have rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees. There are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements. Under this policy, revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution of royalty disputes and arbitration. Marketable Securities and Investments We invest in various types of securities, including: short term and long term marketable securities, principally corporate notes and government securities, in which our excess cash balances are invested; equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements; and equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available. These investments are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, or APB 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common, as appropriate. In accounting for investments we evaluate if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is other than temporary, and if so, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income. The factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security, the duration of the 69 Table of Contents securitys decline, prospects for the investee, including favorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements and our intent and ability to hold to recovery. The determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on our results. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded charges related to impairments that were determined to be other than temporary, of $34.4 million, $15.4 million, and $18.5 million, respectively, related to equity securities. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in, first out, or FIFO, method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval, including safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization. We are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. There is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgment may have a material impact on our results in future periods. We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. This periodic review led to the write downs of TYSABRI inventory as of December 31, 2004 and the expensing of TYSABRI during 2005, as described above, and may lead us to expense TYSABRI in subsequent periods. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration, in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred charges to write down inventory of $13.0 million, $75.6 million, and $46.7 million, respectively. Additionally, in 2005, in connection with the divestiture of AMEVIVE, we recorded a charge of $31.8 million to write down AMEVIVE inventory to its net realizable value. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes a provision for income tax contingencies. We utilize a best estimate approach for establishing loss contingencies related to income tax uncertainties based on the definition of a liability in FASB Concept Statement No. 6. These provisions are adjusted when an event occurs or additional information becomes available that impacts the amounts of our estimates. While we believe that the amount of the tax estimates is reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may differ from provisions for contingencies, and these differences could be significant. 70 Table of Contents In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of viable tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. On September 12, 2006, we received a Notice of Assessment from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for $38.9 million, including penalties and interest, with respect to the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustment and will vigorously oppose the assessment. We believe that the assessment does not impact the level of our liabilities for income tax contingencies. However, there is a possibility that we may not prevail in all of our assertions. If this is resolved unfavorably in the future based on facts and conditions currently not available to us, this could have a material impact on our future effective tax rate and our results of operations in the period in which an event would occur. FIN 48 Assessment We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, on our financial statements. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, contract services and other outside expenses. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. The timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense. Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of management fees, site management and site monitoring costs, and data management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses have not been material and are adjusted for in the period which they become known. We have entered into certain research agreements in which we share expenses with our collaborator. We have entered into other collaborations where we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of our collaborative partners. We record these expenses as research and development expenses. If the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator, we record payments by the collaborator for their share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense. Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and In process Research and Development Expenses We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates, as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, an independent third party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically 71 Table of Contents used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimating the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting regulatory approvals; estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We have operations in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada in connection with the sale of AVONEX. We also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Euro, Swedish krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar). We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk, but do not engage in currency speculation. We use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, or SFAS 133, requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. We assess, both at their inception and on an on going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. We also assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument, and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings. Under this policy, and in accordance with SFAS 133, earnings may vary if the forecasted transaction does not occur, or if there is material hedge ineffectiveness or if the hedge ceases to be highly effective. Long Lived Assets Long lived assets to be held and used, including intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Long lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell. During 2005, we incurred charges to write down fixed assets of $118.1 million. No charges were recognized in 2006 and 2004. During 2005 and 2004, we incurred charges to write down intangibles of $13.6 million and $27.8 million, respectively. No impairment charges were incurred in 2006. Goodwill We regularly assess our goodwill balance to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. To do this, in the case of goodwill we estimate the fair value of each of our 72 Table of Contents reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets. Calculating fair value as well as future cash flows requires that we make a number of critical legal, economic, market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date. We believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable and reflective of common practice. Notwithstanding this, our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results, or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment. Contingencies and Litigation There has been, and we expect there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices, regulatory issues, pricing, and patents and other intellectual property rights. Certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future, including in the litigation described under Legal Matters, could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position. Share based Payments We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share based payment awards. In connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, we use the Black Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions. The key assumptions we make are: the expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the award; and the expected forfeiture rate. In connection with our restricted stock programs we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments. New Accounting Standards Please refer to Note 25, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Controls and Procedures We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2006. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of that period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our 73 Table of Contents internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports. We have not made any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a companys board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F 61 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have operations in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada in connection with the sale of AVONEX and TYSABRI. We also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through Genentech on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Euro, Swedish krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc). We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation. We use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities (for example, a strengthening of the Euro) would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $26.9 million. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account operating transactions. 74 Table of Contents In addition, the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. We estimate that such hypothetical adverse 100 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $19.9 million to our interest rate sensitive instruments. We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. We regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $11.7 million.
