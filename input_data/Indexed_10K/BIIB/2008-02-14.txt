Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Information In addition to historical information, this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in our forward looking statements. You can identify our forward looking statements by our use of words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, plan, project, target, will and other words and terms of similar meaning. You also can identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding the anticipated level of future product sales, royalty revenues, expenses and profits, regulatory approvals, our long term growth, the development and marketing of additional products, the impact of competitive products, the anticipated outcome of pending or anticipated litigation and patent related proceedings, our ability to meet our manufacturing needs, the value of investments in certain marketable securities, liquidity and capital resources and our plans to spend additional capital on external business development and research opportunities. Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed in Item 1A in the section entitled Risk Factors in Part I of this report and elsewhere in this report. Unless required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K, beginning on page F 1. Executive Summary Biogen Idec Inc. was formed in 2003 upon the acquisition of Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation in a merger transaction, or the Merger. We are a global biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas of high unmet medical needs. We have two licensed biological bulk manufacturing facilities, including our large scale manufacturing plant in Research Triangle Park, NC, which is one of the worlds largest cell culture facilities. An additional large scale manufacturing plant is under construction in Hillerd, Denmark. We maintain research centers of excellence in San Diego, CA and Cambridge, MA. We have additional offices in Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan and throughout Europe, including our international headquarters in Zug, Switzerland and operate a global distribution network, which covers over 70 countries. We currently employ approximately 4,300 people worldwide. Results for the year ended December 31, 2007 included total revenue of $3,171.6 million, net income of $638.2 million and diluted net income per share of $1.99. These results reflect an increase in revenue primarily attributable to the continued growth in TYSABRI revenue, an increase in RITUXAN revenues from our unconsolidated joint business arrangement as well as the impact of price increases on our AVONEX product. The effect of the increase in revenue was partially offset by an increase in research and development expense due to new and existing clinical trials and other projects and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense related to increased personnel to support ongoing TYSABRI and AVONEX sales. In January 2008, we received notice from Icahn Partners LP and certain of its affiliates for the nomination of three individuals to our Board of Directors at the Companys 2008 Annual Meeting. The notice also includes a proposal to amend the our bylaws to set the size of the Board at 12. Our Board of Directors will review the notice and consider it in light of the best interests of all shareholders of the Company. 47 Table of Contents In October 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized management to evaluate whether third parties would have an interest in acquiring us at a price and on terms that would represent a better value for our stockholders than having us continue to execute our strategy on a stand alone basis. In December 2007, we announced that the board of directors had completed this evaluation, it resulted in no definitive offers to acquire the company and we will continue as an independent company. In November 2007, we entered into an agreement with Neurimmune SubOne AG, or Neurimmune, for the worldwide development and commercialization of human antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD). Neurimmune will conduct research to identify potential therapeutic antibodies and we will be responsible for the development and commercialization of all products. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a $2.0 million upfront payment and could pay up to an additional $378.0 million if certain milestones are met, as well as a royalty on net sales of any products. In August 2007, an agreement with Cardiokine Biopharma LLC became effective for the joint development of lixivaptan, an oral compound for the potential treatment of hyponatremia in patients with congestive heart failure. We will be responsible for the global commercialization of lixivaptan and Cardiokine Biopharma LLC has an option for limited co promotion in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a $50.0 million upfront fee and could pay up to an additional $170.0 million if certain milestones are met. In July 2007, we completed a tender offer in which we purchased 56,424,155 shares of our common stock for a purchase price of $2,990.5 million. We funded the transaction in July 2007 through existing cash and cash equivalents of $1,490.5 million and by obtaining a short term loan for $1,500.0 million. We retired all of these shares in July 2007. In January 2007, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock of Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for total initial consideration of $44.4 million and contingent payments of up to $124.4 million, if certain milestones are achieved. Marketed Products We currently have four products: AVONEX (interferon beta 1a); RITUXAN (rituximab); TYSABRI (natalizumab); FUMADERM (dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts) In December 2007, we sold the U.S. marketing, sales, and manufacturing and development right of ZEVALIN to Cell Therapeutics, Inc., or CTI, for an upfront purchase price of $10.0 million and up to an additional $20.0 million in milestone payments. In addition, we will receive royalty payments on future sales of ZEVALIN. As part of the overall agreement, we entered into a supply agreement with CTI to sell ZEVALIN product through 2014 and a related services and security agreement under which CTI has agreed to reimburse us for costs incurred in an ongoing randomized clinical trial for ZEVALIN with respect to aggressive non Hodgkins lymphoma, or NHL. The $10.0 million upfront payment will be recognized in our results of operations over the term of the supply agreement. Through April 2006, we recorded product revenues from sales of AMEVIVE (alefacept). In April 2006, we sold the worldwide rights to this product to Astellas Pharma US, Inc., or Astellas. We will continue to manufacture and supply this product to Astellas for a period of up to 11 years. Under the terms of the supply agreement, we charge Astellas fixed amounts based on volume. Such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and are not expected to be significant. Most of our revenues are currently dependent on AVONEX, TYSABRI, and RITUXAN. In the near term, we are dependent on the continued sales growth of TYSABRI to grow our overall revenues. In the longer term, our revenue growth is dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of current pipeline products and other in licensed or acquired products and programs. 48 Table of Contents Continued growth of global AVONEX sales is primarily dependent on maintaining AVONEXs position as the most prescribed multiple sclerosis, or MS, therapy in the U.S. and growing AVONEX market share outside the U.S. In both the U.S. and globally, we face increasing competition in the MS market from currently marketed products and future products in late stage development. We continue to generate data showing AVONEX to be an effective and safe choice for MS patients and physicians. The majority of RITUXAN sales are currently from use in the oncology setting. We believe there is additional room for RITUXAN sales growth in the immunology setting, where RITUXAN is currently indicated for patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, or RA, with inadequate response to anti tumor necrosis factor therapies, or TNF IR RA patients. Additional immunology indications for RITUXAN that we are investigating include earlier stage RA patients with inadequate response to disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs, or DMARD IR patients, MS and lupus. In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in the U.S. in connection with the re introduction and internationally for the first time. TYSABRI sales are currently for use in the relapsing remitting MS setting. Growth in TYSABRI revenue will be dependent on the generation of a larger and longer term safety database as well as continued acceptance by physicians and MS patients. In January 2008, the FDA approved TYSABRI as a treatment of certain patients with Crohns disease. Clinical Studies Over the past few years, we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels. For 2008, we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures. We have a number of pipeline products in late stage clinical trials, including over 15 pipeline products in Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials. Pipeline products for which we have entered or initiated Phase 3 trials include: BG 12 for relapsing forms of MS; Galiximab for NHL; and RITUXAN for a number of indications, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, RA, primary progressive MS and lupus nephritis. In addition to the expense associated with these late stage trials, other pipeline products are in ongoing or are expected to enter proof of concept trials in 2008. Business Development As part of our business strategy, we plan to consider and, as appropriate, make acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies. Our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and develop such products and or technologies, and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions. In addition, as a result of our acquisition efforts, we may experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses that may include transaction costs, closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges. Other We may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results, primarily based on the level and timing of: product revenues; cost of product sales; collaboration revenues; cost of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product approvals; marketing and other expenses; 49 Table of Contents manufacturing or supply disruptions; and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies. We expect to use our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of businesses, products, product rights or technologies, as well as potential repayment of short term debt. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of future revenue growth, such as the degree of market acceptance, the impact of competition, the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop, receive approval for and successfully launch our near term product candidates.

AVONEX Revenues from AVONEX were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 AVONEX U.S. $ 1,085.0 58.1 % $ 1,022.2 59.9 % $ 938.7 60.8 % Rest of world 782.8 41.9 % 684.5 40.1 % 604.4 39.2 % Total AVONEX revenues $ 1,867.8 100.0 % $ 1,706.7 100.0 % $ 1,543.1 100.0 % For 2007 compared to 2006, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased $62.8 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to the impact of price increases offset by decreased product demand resulting in lower volume. For 2007 compared to 2006 and international sales of AVONEX increased $98.3 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to the impact of exchange rates and higher sales volume. For 2006 compared to 2005, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased $83.5 million, or 8.9%, primarily due to the impact of price increases and a reduction in discounts associated with the introduction of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. These increases were offset by lower volume. For 2006 compared to 2005, international sales of AVONEX increased $80.1 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to increases in volume and price, including the impact of patient mix. Foreign exchange accounted for a 0.6% increase in reported revenues; on a local currency basis, international sales increased 12.7%. We expect to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace in and outside the U.S. from existing and new MS treatments, including TYSABRI, which may impact sales of AVONEX. We expect future sales of AVONEX to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. TYSABRI Revenues from TYSABRI were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 TYSABRI U.S. $ 104.4 45.4 % $ 25.8 72.1 % $ 4.7 100.0 % Rest of world 125.5 54.6 % 10.0 27.9 % Total TYSABRI revenues $ 229.9 100.0 % $ 35.8 100.0 % $ 4.7 100.0 % 51 Table of Contents Under the terms of a collaboration agreement with Elan Corporation plc, or Elan, we manufacture TYSABRI and collaborate with Elan on the products marketing, commercial distribution and on going development activities. We recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. upon Elans shipment of the product to third party distributors. We recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI outside the U.S. at the time of product delivery to our customers. In November 2004, TYSABRI was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further notification. In 2005, our net revenue associated with sales of TYSABRI was $4.7 million, which consisted of revenue of $15.1 million from sales that occurred prior to our voluntary suspension, offset by an allowance for sales returns of $10.4 million related to returns of product sold prior to the suspension. On June 5, 2006, the FDA approved a supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, for the reintroduction of TYSABRI as a monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of MS to slow the progression of disability and reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. On June 29, 2006, we and Elan announced that the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, had approved TYSABRI as a similar treatment. In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in both the United States and Europe. In 2006, we recorded revenue on sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. and Europe relating to 2006 activity of $11.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Prior to the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005, we shipped product to Elan in the U.S. and recognized revenue in accordance with the policy described above. As a result of the suspension of TYSABRI, we had deferred $14.0 million in revenue related to TYSABRI product that remained in Elans ending inventory. This amount was paid by Elan during 2005 and was subsequently recognized as revenue during 2006, when the uncertainty about the ultimate disposition of the product was eliminated. In 2007, we have recorded revenue on sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. and Europe of $104.4 million and $125.5 million, respectively. The increase in 2007 sales over 2006 sales is primarily due to an increase in the number of patients using TYSABRI and increased volumes, as the product was being shipped for the entire 12 months during 2007. During 2007 and 2006, we had product on hand that had been fully written off in 2005 due to the uncertainties surrounding the TYSABRI suspension but which is available to fill future orders. As we sold TYSABRI in 2007 and 2006, we realized lower than normal cost of sales and, therefore, higher margins, as we shipped the inventory that had been previously written off. For 2007 and 2006, cost of sales was approximately $12.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, lower due to the sale of TYSABRI that had been previously written off. All TYSABRI inventory that had been previously written off had been shipped as of December 31, 2007. FUMADERM FUMADERM was produced by Fumapharm, which we acquired in June 2006. In December 2006, we acquired the right to distribute FUMADERM in Germany from Fumedica, beginning on May 1, 2007. In connection with the acquisition of the FUMADERM distribution rights in Germany, we committed to the repurchase of any inventory Fumedica had not sold by May 1, 2007. As a result of this provision, we deferred the recognition of revenue on shipments made to Fumedica through April 30, 2007. We resumed recognizing revenue on sales of FUMADERM into the German market in May 2007. Sales of FUMADERM for 2007 and 2006 were $21.5 million and $9.5 million, respectively. The increase in 2007 sales over 2006 sales is primarily due to increased volumes. ZEVALIN In 2007, 2006 and 2005 sales of ZEVALIN were $16.9 million, $17.8 million and $20.7 million, respectively, of which $13.9 million, $16.4 million, and $19.4 million respectively, were generated in the U.S. The decrease in total ZEVALIN sales in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the reduction in sales and marketing efforts in 2007 as we prepared for the sale of our rights to market, sell, manufacture and develop ZEVALIN in the U.S., which was completed in December 2007. 52 Table of Contents AMEVIVE In 2007, 2006 and 2005, sales of AMEVIVE were $0.7 million, $11.5 million and $48.5 million, respectively, of which $0.3 million, $5.0 million and $34.9 million, respectively, were generated in the U.S. The decrease in total AMEVIVE sales for 2007 compared to 2006 and for 2006 compared to 2005 was due to the sale, in April 2006, of our worldwide rights and infrastructure related to sales, production, and marketing of AMEVIVE. Although we sold the rights to this product, we continue to report a small amount of product revenues related to shipments made by certain of our overseas joint ventures, which we consolidate. Provisions for Discounts and Allowances Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, typically upon delivery. Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration, or VA, rebates, managed care rebates, product returns, other applicable allowances and, in 2006 and 2005, patient assistance and patient replacement goods. The estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent significant judgments. Effective January 1, 2007, we changed the manner in which we administer our patient assistance and patient replacement goods programs. Prior to January 1, 2007, AVONEX product shipped for these programs was invoiced and recorded as gross product revenue and an offsetting provision for discount and returns was recorded for expected credit requests from the distributor that administers these programs on our behalf. Effective January 1, 2007, we entered into a new arrangement with a distributor, which established a consignment sales model. Under the new sales model, gross revenue is not recorded for product shipped to satisfy these programs, and cost of sales is recorded when the product is shipped. Provisions for discounts and allowances reduced gross product revenues as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Discounts $ 45.7 $ 102.9 $ 106.5 Contractual adjustments 105.2 93.3 93.8 Returns 22.1 38.7 26.0 Total allowances $ 173.0 $ 234.9 $ 226.3 Gross product revenues $ 2,309.8 $ 2,016.2 $ 1,843.3 Percent of gross product revenues 7.5 % 11.7 % 12.3 % 53 Table of Contents An analysis of the amount of, and change in, reserves is as follows (in millions): Contractual Discounts Adjustments Returns Total 2007 Beginning Balance $ 12.7 $ 30.5 $ 17.8 $ 61.0 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 45.7 113.1 17.1 175.9 Adjustments relating to prior years (7.9 ) 5.0 (2.9 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (39.4 ) (72.3 ) (0.4 ) (112.1 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (12.6 ) (30.3 ) (19.1 ) (62.0 ) Other adjustments Ending Balance $ 6.4 $ 33.1 $ 20.4 $ 59.9 2006 Beginning Balance $ 11.6 $ 35.7 $ 2.3 $ 49.6 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 102.9 96.4 31.6 230.9 Adjustments relating to prior years (3.1 ) 7.1 4.0 Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (90.2 ) (63.1 ) (16.1 ) (169.4 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (11.6 ) (35.4 ) (12.5 ) (59.5 ) Other adjustments 5.4 5.4 Ending Balance $ 12.7 $ 30.5 $ 17.8 $ 61.0 2005 Beginning Balance $ 7.8 $ 18.4 $ 5.2 $ 31.4 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 106.5 92.8 18.5 217.8 Adjustments relating to prior years 1.0 7.5 8.5 Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (94.9 ) (57.5 ) (16.2 ) (168.6 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (7.8 ) (19.0 ) (12.7 ) (39.5 ) Ending Balance $ 11.6 $ 35.7 $ 2.3 $ 49.6 Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. Product revenue reserves are categorized as follows: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns. Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives and, in 2006 and 2005, patient assistance. For 2007 compared to 2006, discounts decreased $57.2 million, or 55.6%, resulting from a $67.5 million reduction related to the change of patient assistance to a consignment model, offset by increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives. For 2006 compared to 2005, discounts decreased $3.6 million, or 3.4%, reflecting lower amounts of AVONEX distributed through our patient assistance program. Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid, VA and managed care rebates and other applicable allowances. For 2007 compared to 2006, contractual adjustments increased $11.9 million, or 12.8%, primarily due to the impact of higher reserves for managed care (associated with higher level of activity with respect to rebates) and Medicaid and VA programs (associated with price increases). For 2006 compared to 2005, contractual adjustments were consistent reflecting more activity in the managed care markets, offset by a reduction in Medicaid activity due to the introduction of Medicare Part D, the expanded prescription drug benefit program. Product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers and our patient replacement goods program in 2006 and 2005. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from our patients for various reasons. For 2007 54 Table of Contents compared to 2006, returns decreased $16.6 million, or 42.9%, primarily due to a $15.0 million decrease related to the change to a consignment sales model for patient replacement goods. For 2006 compared to 2005, returns increased $12.7 million, or 48.8%, as a result of an adjustment of $6.9 million to increase reserve levels to correct prior period errors, and higher return experience in 2006. These increases were offset by the impact of returns made in connection with the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005. Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product. Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenues We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, under a collaboration agreement between the parties. Under the collaboration agreement, we granted Genentech a worldwide license to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in multiple indications. In exchange for these worldwide rights, we have copromotion rights in the U.S. and a contractual arrangement under which Genentech shares a portion of the pretax U.S. copromotion profits of RITUXAN with us. This collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement, not through a joint venture or other legal entity. In June 2003, we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with Genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti CD20 antibodies targeting B cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of indications. In the U.S., we contribute resources to selling and the continued development of RITUXAN. Genentech is responsible for worldwide manufacturing of RITUXAN. Genentech also is responsible for the primary support functions for the commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. including selling and marketing, customer service, order entry, distribution, shipping and billing. Genentech also incurs the majority of continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Under the arrangement, we have a limited sales force as well as limited development activity. Under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between Genentech and F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd., or Roche, commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where Roche copromotes RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co Ltd., or Zenyaku. There is no direct contractual arrangement between us and Roche or Zenyaku. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of pretax copromotion profits, which is calculated by Genentech, and includes consideration of our RITUXAN related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenue from sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Pre tax copromotion profit consists of U.S. sales of RITUXAN to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses, and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Copromotion profits $ 616.8 $ 555.8 $ 513.8 Reimbursement of selling and development expenses 58.5 61.1 47.6 Royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. 250.8 194.0 147.5 $ 926.1 $ 810.9 $ 708.9 55 Table of Contents Copromotion profits consist of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Product revenues, net $ 2,284.8 $ 2,071.2 $ 1,831.5 Costs and expenses 730.2 669.3 534.6 Copromotion profits $ 1,554.6 $ 1,401.9 $ 1,296.9 Biogen Idecs share of copromotion profits $ 616.8 $ 555.8 $ 513.8 Net sales of RITUXAN to third party customers in the U.S. recorded by Genentech for 2007 were $2,284.8 million compared to $2,071.2 million in 2006 and $1,831.5 million in 2005. The increase in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to increased unit sales in treatments of B cell NHLs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (an unapproved use of RITUXAN), increased utilization for RA and increases in the wholesale price of RITUXAN. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to the approval by the FDA of RITUXAN for two new indications, RA and diffuse large B cell lymphoma and an increase in wholesale prices. For 2007 compared to 2006, reimbursements of selling and development expenses decreased $2.6 million, or 4.2%. For 2006 compared to 2005, such reimbursements increased $13.5 million, or 28.3%. This increase was primarily due to the expansion of the oncology sales force and development costs we incurred related to the development of RITUXAN for RA. Our royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is based on Roche and Zenyakus net sales to third party customers and is recorded on a cash basis. Royalty revenues in 2007 compared to 2006 increased $56.8 million, or 29.3% due to increased sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. Royalty revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 increased $46.5 million, or 31.5%, primarily due to increased market penetration and an increase in prices. The royalty period with respect to all products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis. RITUXAN was launched in 1998 in most European countries and in 2001 in Japan. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula, which resets annually, is as follows: Biogen Idecs Share Copromotion Operating Profits of Copromotion Profits First $50 million 30 % Greater than $50 million 40 % In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the 40% threshold was met during the first quarter. For each calendar year or portion thereof following the approval date of the first new anti CD20 product, the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and other anti CD20 products sold by us and Genentech will change. Additionally, under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of new anti CD20 products, if and when commercially available, as compared to royalty revenue received on sales of RITUXAN. (See Note 16, Unconsolidated Joint Business Arrangement, for further detail). Other Revenue Other revenues consist of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Royalties $ 102.1 93.9 % $ 86.2 94.9 % $ 93.2 96.5 % Corporate partner 6.6 6.1 % 4.6 5.1 % 3.4 3.5 % $ 108.7 100.0 % $ 90.8 100.0 % $ 96.6 100.0 % 56 Table of Contents Royalty Revenues We receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control. Our royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. are included in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For 2007 compared to 2006, royalty revenues increased $15.9 million, or 18.4%, primarily due to an increase in sales levels of products under license partially offset by the expiration of royalties under certain contracts. For 2006 compared to 2005, royalty revenue decreased $7.0 million, or 7.5%, primarily due to a decrease in sales levels of products under license and to the expiration of certain contracts. We anticipate that total royalty revenues in future years will continue to represent a lower proportion of our total revenues. Royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs. Corporate Partner Revenues Corporate partner revenues represent contract revenues and license fees. Costs and Expenses Costs and expenses are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 335.2 14.0 % $ 274.4 12.3 % $ 373.6 17.1 % Research and development 925.2 38.7 % 718.4 32.0 % 747.7 34.2 % Selling, general and administrative 776.1 32.4 % 685.0 30.5 % 644.8 29.5 % Collaboration profit (loss) sharing 14.0 0.6 % (9.7 ) (0.4 )% Acquired in process research and development 84.2 3.5 % 330.5 14.7 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 257.5 10.8 % 267.0 11.9 % 302.3 13.8 % Facility impairments and (gain) loss on disposition, net (0.4 ) (16.5 ) (0.7 )% 118.1 5.4 % Gain on termination of license agreements, net (6.1 ) (0.3 )% Total costs and expenses $ 2,391.8 100.0 % $ 2,243.0 100.0 % $ 2,186.5 100.0 % Inventory Write Offs We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or that became obsolete due to expiration. In all cases product inventory was written down to its estimated net realizable value. We closely monitor levels of inventory in our distribution channel. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had approximately 2 weeks of inventory with wholesalers in our distribution channel. The shelf life associated with our products is generally between 15 and 48 months, depending on the product. Obsolescence due to dating 57 Table of Contents expiration has not been a historical concern, given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel. Changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us. We do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business. We have written down the following inventory, which was charged to cost of sales (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 AVONEX $ 11.1 $ 4.4 $ 12.0 TYSABRI 4.0 2.9 23.2 FUMADERM 0.1 AMEVIVE 0.1 2.4 30.3 ZEVALIN 6.3 3.3 10.1 $ 21.6 $ 13.0 $ 75.6 The write downs were the result of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 New components for alternative presentations $ $ $ 8.4 Failed quality specifications 12.0 11.2 23.1 Excess and or obsolescence 9.6 1.8 20.9 Costs for voluntary suspension of TYSABRI 23.2 $ 21.6 $ 13.0 $ 75.6 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses totaled $925.2 million in 2007 compared to $718.4 million in 2006 and $747.7 million in 2005. For 2007 compared to 2006, research and development expenses increased $206.8 million, or 28.8%, primarily due to approximately $65.5 million of expense for the development of lixivaptan, (including a $50 million upfront payment to Cardiokine Biopharma LLC), a $12.4 million increase for ADENTRI projects, a $32.6 million increase for lumiliximab projects, a $15.2 million increase for BG 12 projects, a $13.5 million increase for HSP90i projects, a $12.4 million increase for IGF 1R projects, a $27.6 million increase for baminercept alfa (LTBR Fc) projects and $18.4 million of research and development costs related to Syntonix projects. For 2006 compared to 2005, research and development expenses decreased $29.3 million, or 3.9%, primarily due to a $61.5 million reduction in salary and benefits arising from headcount reductions in 2005, a $20.0 million decrease related to the NIMO facility that was sold in the second quarter of 2005, and a $23.0 million decrease for clinical trials, primarily related to TYSABRI and AMEVIVE. These decreases were offset by a $11.2 million increase for new collaborations during the year, a $10.8 million increase for higher clinical manufacturing, and the $51.5 million impact of share based compensation recognized under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (revised 2004) No. 123R, Share based Payments, or SFAS 123(R), in 2006. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in 2008 for a number of reasons, including our expected clinical trial costs, costs incurred with our collaborative development efforts, and pursuit of additional research opportunities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $776.1 million in 2007 compared to $685.0 million in 2006 and $644.8 million in 2005. 58 Table of Contents For 2007 compared to 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $91.1 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to a $65.0 million increase in sales and marketing activities for TYSABRI, primarily in international sales and marketing, a $25.5 million net increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount in general and administrative personnel, a $19.0 million increase in fees and services related to general and administrative matters offset by a $12.1 million decrease in sales and marketing activities for ZEVALIN due to decreased commercial efforts due to the planned divestiture of this product line. For 2006 compared to 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40.2 million, or 6.2%, primarily due to $21.5 million of higher expenses related to sales of RITUXAN in RA, $20.3 million of increased sales expenses for the re launch of TYSABRI, $4.3 million of lower reimbursements related to collaboration agreements and $45.2 million of higher expenses related to share based compensation recognized under SFAS 123(R) in 2006. These increases were offset by $31.0 million of lower expenses related to sales of AMEVIVE due to its divestiture and a $20.0 million decrease in expenses related to sales of ZEVALIN, due in part to the planned divestiture, and also due to the impact of a charge taken in 2005 related to a write down of remaining prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with MDS Nordion. We anticipate that total selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2008 will be higher than 2007 due to sales, marketing and other general and administrative expenses to primarily support AVONEX and TYSABRI, especially in the international market. Severance and Other Restructuring Costs Severance and other restructuring costs totaled $1.8 million in 2007 as compared to $3.6 million in 2006 and $31.4 million in 2005. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2007, there are no remaining material severance or restructuring accruals on our consolidated balance sheets. For 2006, $3.6 million of restructuring charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, including $1.2 million in severance costs associated with the acquisition of Conforma during 2006 and $1.7 million related in headcount reductions related to the planned disposition of our ZEVALIN product line. Costs not yet paid as of December 31, 2006, were $2.1 million, and are included in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 22, Severance and Other Restructuring Costs, of the consolidated financial statements, for details on the change in reserve levels related to severance. In September 2005, we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management layers and staff functions, resulting in a 17% reduction of our workforce at that time. These adjustments took place across company functions, departments and sites, and were substantially implemented by the end of 2005. We recorded restructuring charges of $31.4 million in connection with these activities, of which $28.3 million related to severance and other employee termination costs, including health benefits, outplacement and bonuses. Other costs were $3.1 million and included write downs of certain research assets that will no longer be utilized, consulting costs in connection with the restructuring effort, and costs related to the acceleration of restricted stock, offset by the reversal of previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted stock cancellations. Effective December 31, 2005, our former Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board retired and resigned. The charges related to this retirement amounted to $7.1 million and were all paid in 2005. We may have additional charges in future periods. The amount of those future charges cannot be determined at this time. Amortization of Intangible Assets For 2007, 2006, and 2005, amortization expense was $257.5 million, $267.0 million and $302.3 million, respectively. Our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our AVONEX product. Our amortization policy for our core technology intangible asset is based on the principles of Statement of Financial Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS 142, which requires the amortization of intangible assets to 59 Table of Contents reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. Every year during the third quarter we complete our long range planning cycle, which includes an analysis of the anticipated product sales of AVONEX. The results of this forecast serve as the basis for our assumptions used in the economic consumption amortization model for our core technology intangible asset. We also establish minimum annual amortization amounts to ensure amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods. See Note 1, Business Overview and Significant Accounting Policies, for a detailed description of our accounting policy for amortization of intangible assets. For 2007 compared to 2006, amortization expense decreased $9.5 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to the changes in estimate of the future revenue of AVONEX, which serves as the basis in our calculation of economic consumption for core technology. For 2006 compared to 2005, amortization expense decreased $35.3 million, or 11.7%, primarily due to the changes in estimate of the future revenue of AVONEX, which serves as the basis for our calculation of economic consumption for core technology. Additionally, in 2005, a $7.9 million impairment charge was recorded to write down certain core technology intangible assets related to AVONEX to their fair value. We review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations. In Process Research and Development (IPRD) IPRD charges totaled $84.2 million in 2007, compared with $330.5 million in 2006. No IPRD charges were taken in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded IPRD charges of $84.2 million. The principal components of this amount are as follows: $18.4 million related to the acquisition of Syntonix, approximately $30 million related to the collaboration with Cardiokine Biopharma LLC, and $34.3 million related to the collaboration with Neurimmune. In 2006, we recorded $207.4 million and $123.1 million in IPRD related to the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, or Fumapharm, and Conforma, respectively. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, and Note 15, Research Collaborations of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cardiokine Biopharma LLC and Neurimmune are variable interest entities, as defined in FIN 46(R). The consolidation of these entities resulted in IPRD charges. The IPRD charges have been recorded as a component of operating income. However, because the IPRD charges relate to the fair value of the underlying technology retained by the parent companies of Cardiokine Biopharma LLC and Neurimmune, these amounts were allocated to the respective minority interests. Consequently, minority interest of $64.3 million was recorded as a component of non operating income. Facility Impairments and (Gain) Loss on Disposition, net In 2007, we sold approximately 28 acres of land in Oceanside, California for $16.5 million. We recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $7.2 million on the sale, which is included in other income (expense) on the accompanying consolidated statement of income, as this land was not utilized in our operations. In December 2006, we completed the sale of one of the buildings in our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility, known as Bio 1. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $39.5 million. We recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $15.6 million on the sale. We continued to occupy a minor portion of the building under a leasing arrangement. In February 2006, we sold our clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known as NICO. The assets associated with the facility were included in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. Total consideration was $29.0 million. In 2005, we recorded impairment charges totaling $28.0 million to reduce the carrying value of NICO to its net realizable value. No additional loss resulted from completion of the sale. In June 2005, we sold our large scale biologics manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known as NIMO, along with approximately 60 acres of real property located in Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is 60 Table of Contents located, together with improvements, related property rights, and certain personal property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real property. Total consideration for the sale was $408.1 million. The loss from this transaction was $83.5 million which consisted primarily of the write down of NIMO to net selling price, sales and transfer taxes, and other associated transaction costs. After our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerd, Denmark, but determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of the facility. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6.2 million in 2005 related to the fill finish component that had previously been capitalized. Gain on Settlement of License Agreements, net In 2006, we recorded a net gain on settlement of license agreements, net of $6.1 million. Fumapharm During 2006, we recorded a gain of $34.2 million coincident with the acquisition of Fumapharm in accordance with EITF 04 1, Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination, or EITF 04 1. The gain related to the settlement of a preexisting collaboration agreement between Fumapharm and us. The collaboration agreement was entered into in October 2003 and required payments to Fumapharm of certain royalty amounts. The market rate for such payments was higher at the acquisition date, primarily due to the increased technical feasibility of BG 12. The gain relates to the difference between the royalty rates at the time the agreement was entered into as compared to the rates at the time the agreement was effectively settled by virtue of our acquisition of Fumapharm. Fumedica During 2006, we recorded a charge of $28.1 million in connection with a settlement agreement with Fumedica Arzneimittel AG and Fumedica Arzneimittel GmbH, collectively Fumedica. The charge related to the settlement of the agreement with Fumedica under which we were contingently obligated to make royalty payments with respect to a successful launch of BG 12 for psoriasis in Germany. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we will not be required to make any royalty payments to Fumedica if BG 12 is successfully launched for psoriasis in Germany. The $28.1 million was expensed in 2006, as it related to a product that has not reached technological feasibility. Share based Compensation Expense In the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded share based compensation expense of $123.1 million associated with SFAS 123(R). In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded share based compensation expense of $126.8 million associated with SFAS 123(R), which is net of a cumulative effect pre tax adjustment of $5.6 million, or $3.8 million after tax. The cumulative effect results from the application of an estimated forfeiture rate for current and prior period unvested restricted stock awards. Our share based compensation programs consist of share based awards granted to employees including stock options, restricted stock, performance share units and restricted stock units, or RSUs, as well as our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R). This Statement requires compensation cost relating to share based awards to be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value measurement method. Under the fair value method, the estimated fair value of awards is charged against income over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We selected the modified prospective method as prescribed in SFAS 123(R) and, therefore, prior periods were not restated. Under the modified prospective method, this Statement was applied to awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, as well as to the unvested portion of previously granted equity based awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of December 31, 2005. The fair value of performance based stock units is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level will be achieved. Compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the outcome of performance related conditions until the vesting date. 61 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Interest income $ 103.6 $ 101.2 $ 62.7 Minority interest income (expense) 58.4 (6.8 ) Interest expense (40.5 ) (0.9 ) (9.6 ) Other, net 9.3 (41.4 ) (32.9 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 130.8 $ 52.1 $ 20.2 Interest Income For 2007 compared to 2006, interest income increased $2.4 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to higher yields offset by a reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to the funding of our tender offer in July 2007. For 2006 compared to 2005, interest income increased $38.5 million, or 61.4%, primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities. Minority Interest For 2007 compared to 2006, minority interest increased $65.2 million, primarily due to the consolidation of Cardiokine Biopharma LLC in August 2007, and Neurimmune in November 2007. The minority interest related to Cardiokine Biopharma LLC and Neurimmune offset an equal charge to IPRD, which resulted in no net impact to our results of operations for these IPRD and minority interest charges. Interest Expense Interest expense was $40.5 million, $0.9 million and $9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For 2007 compared to 2006, interest expense increased $39.6 million, primarily due to the increased debt levels relating to our tender offer funded in July 2007 (see Note 20, Tender Offer). For 2006 compared to 2005, interest expense decreased $8.7 million, or 90.6%, primarily due to the repurchase of our senior notes due in 2032 in the second quarter of 2005. Other, net Other, net, included the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Impairments of investments $ (24.4 ) $ (34.4 ) $ (15.4 ) Foreign exchange gains (losses), net 3.0 4.9 (8.7 ) Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net 16.7 (2.8 ) (8.4 ) Settlement of litigation and claims 0.1 (4.6 ) (2.1 ) Other 13.9 (4.5 ) 1.7 Total other, net $ 9.3 $ (41.4 ) $ (32.9 ) The impairment of investments is primarily due to the other than temporary decline in value in our strategic investments portfolio. We may incur additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. 62 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate was 29.9%, 56.6% and 37.3% on pre tax income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the effect of lower income tax rates (less than the U.S. statutory tax rate) in certain non U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective rate for 2006 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the write off of non deductible IPRD in connection with the acquisitions of Conforma and Fumapharm, (offset by the gain on settlement of the Fumapharm license agreement), and the impact of acquisition related intangible amortization related to foreign jurisdictions and state taxes, offset by the effect of lower income tax in certain non U.S. jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for 2005 varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the acquisition related intangible amortization arising from purchase accounting related to foreign jurisdictions and a one time tax charge related to the repatriation of a portion of the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiary offset, in part, by the effect of lower income tax rates (less than 35% U.S. statutory tax rate) in certain non U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate, tax credits allowed for research and experimentation expenses in the U.S., and the new domestic manufacturing deduction. Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial condition is summarized as follows (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 659.7 $ 661.4 Marketable securities and loaned securities current and non current 1,456.1 1,653.6 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (including loaned securities) $ 2,115.8 $ 2,315.0 Working capital $ 179.2 $ 1,129.7 Outstanding borrowings current and non current $ 1,563.0 $ 96.7 The reduction in working capital at December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006, primarily reflects payments made to fund our tender offer as discussed in Note 20, Tender Offer, offset by cash generated from operations in 2007. Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, foreign and U.S. government instruments, asset backed securities and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy as described in Note 1, Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Our investments are highly rated and, to date, have not been materially impacted by the disruption of capital markets in 2007. Additionally, we lend our marketable securities to third parties to enhance investment returns through our securities lending program as described in Note 1, Business Overview and Significant Accounting Policies. We have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through cash flows from our operations. We financed the tender offer through issuance of short term debt and use of existing cash. We expect to refinance our short term debt through the offering of long term debt securities in 2008. We expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash from operations, as well as existing cash resources including liquidation of marketable securities. We believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we may, from time to time, seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this form 10 K for risk factors that could negatively impact our cash position and ability to fund future operations. 63 Table of Contents Operating activities Cash provided by operations is primarily driven by our net income and adjusted for non cash charges. In 2007, 2006 and 2005 net cash provided by operations was $1,020.6 million, $841.3 million and $889.5 million, respectively. Cash provided by operations increased $179.4 million, or 21.3%, in 2007 compared to 2006, is primarily due to higher earnings. Movements in working capital accounts, which were a use of funds of $77.9 million in 2007 as compared to a use of funds of $103.3 million in 2006, also contributed to this increase. For 2006 compared to 2005, net cash provided by operations decreased $48.2 million or 5.4%. The decrease in cash provided by operations is primarily attributable to movements in working capital accounts which were a use of funds of $103.3 million in 2006 as compared to a source of funds of $139.8 million in 2005. Investing activities In 2007, 2006 and 2005, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(286.6) million, $(599.8) million and $417.7 million, respectively. In 2007, net proceeds from sales of marketable securities were $209.0 million, which was used to partially fund the tender offer described in Note 20, Tender Offer. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $284.1 million in 2007. Payments made for acquisitions were $95.8 million in 2007, which primarily related to our acquisition of Syntonix for $42.3 million, and our collaboration payments to Cardiokine Biopharma LLC for $50.0 million and Neurimmune of $2.0 million. The change in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing activities. Additionally, in 2007 we sold our position in a strategic investment for $99.5 million. In 2006, net cash used to purchase marketable securities was $162.8 million. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $198.3 million for 2006. Payments made for acquisitions were $363.3 million in 2006, which related to our acquisitions of Fumapharm and Conforma. Proceeds from the sale of product lines were $59.8 million in 2006, which related to the sale of AMEVIVE. In 2005 our major sources of cash consisted of $408.1 million of proceeds from the sale of our Oceanside, California manufacturing facility. Additionally, approximately $447.9 million of proceeds was provided from net sales of marketable securities, which was used to fund the repurchase of our senior notes, as discussed below. Purchases of property plant and equipment totaled $318.4 million, including our research and development and administration campus in San Diego, and our manufacturing facility in Oceanside. Additionally, in 2005, we purchased positions in strategic investments of $119.9 million relating to PDL BioPharma Inc., Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and other strategic investments. Financing activities In 2007, 2006 and 2005, net cash used in financing activities was $735.2 million, $148.4 million and $948.5 million, respectively. In 2007, the primary use of cash related to the repurchase of treasury stock via the tender offer of $2,990.5 million. This repurchase was partially funded with cash proceeds from a short term note of $1,500.0 million. This transaction is described in Note 20, Tender Offer. Additionally, cash proceeds from issuance of stock for our share based compensation arrangements were $489.2 million, which was primarily attributable to the exercise of stock options and participation in our ESPP plan. The charge in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing activities. In 2006, the primary use of cash was $320.3 million for the purchase of treasury stock, offset by $147.0 million in proceeds from issuance of stock for our share based compensation arrangements. The primary uses of cash in 2005 were for the repurchase of long term debt of $746.4 million and repurchases of treasury stock of $322.6 million, offset by $119.6 million cash proceeds from the issuance of stock for our share based compensation arrangements. 64 Table of Contents Borrowings At December 31, 2007, we have a note payable of approximately $44.6 million relating to the acquisition of distribution rights of FUMADERM. Additionally, one of our international joint ventures maintained a loan that had a carrying value of $17.5 million as of December 31, 2007. In January and July 2007, we issued a total of 3.0 million shares of common stock for $75.0 million in face value and $39.0 million in carrying value of our 2019 subordinated notes to the holders that elected to convert into common stock. In June 2007, in connection with the tender offer described in Note 20, Tender Offer, we entered into a $1,500.0 million term loan facility, which is due in June 2008. On July 2, 2007, in connection with the funding of the tender offer, we borrowed the full $1,500.0 million available under this facility. We expect to repay this term loan facility in 2008 with proceeds from an offering of long term debt securities. In June 2007, we also entered into a five year $400.0 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we may use for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. In May 2007, holders of the senior notes due 2032 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $10.1 million, exercised their right to require us to repurchase the notes. We paid $6.6 million in cash to repurchase substantially all of the senior notes. Tender Offer On June 27, 2007, pursuant to the terms of a modified Dutch Auction tender offer, we accepted for payment 56,424,155 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.00 per share for a purchase price of $2,990.5 million. We funded the tender offer through existing cash and cash equivalents of $1,490.5 million and $1,500.0 million by our term loan facility as described in Note 7, Indebtedness. All of the shares repurchased were retired in July 2007. Commitments In August 2004, we restarted construction of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerd, Denmark. In March 2005, after our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component, add a labeling and packaging component but would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of that facility. As of December 31, 2007, we have substantially completed this phase of the project, including the partial construction of the bulk manufacturing facility and installation of major equipment. We are proceeding with the second phase of the project, the completion of a large scale bulk manufacturing component and construction of a warehouse. In October 2006, our Board of Directors approved this phase of the project, which is expected to cost an additional $225.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had contractual commitments of approximately $207 million for the second phase, of which approximately $117 million had been paid. This second phase of the project is expected to be licensed for commercial production in 2010. Share Repurchase Programs In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. This repurchase program expired October 4, 2006. During 2006, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of $320.3 million. During 2005, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of $324.3 million under this program. In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 20.0 million shares of our common stock. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. No shares have been repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2007. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2007, we have funding commitments of up to approximately $28.3 million as part of our investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds. In addition, we have committed to make potential 65 Table of Contents future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $1.55 billion as part of our various collaborations including licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of December 31, 2007, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. We expect to make approximately $52 million of milestone payments in 2008. At December 31, 2007, we have several clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations, or CROs. The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable at our option. We have recorded accrued expenses of $15.5 million recorded in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet for work done by CROs at December 31, 2007. We have approximately $254 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts at December 31, 2007. We do not have any significant relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We consolidate entities within the scope of FIN 46(R) if we are the primary beneficiary. The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding funding and contingent milestone payments as described above and construction commitments disclosed above under Commitments) at December 31, 2007, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 4 5 After Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Non cancellable operating leases $ 124.8 $ 27.1 $ 47.0 $ 32.2 $ 18.5 Notes payable 1,562.9 1,511.1 34.0 4.5 13.3 Other long term obligations 15.4 9.5 5.9 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,703.1 $ 1,547.7 $ 86.9 $ 36.7 $ 31.8 This table also excludes any liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. In connection with the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, or FIN 48, we reclassified approximately $113 million in reserves for uncertain tax positions from current taxes payable to long term liabilities. At December 31, 2007, we have approximately $253 million of long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. Legal Matters See Note 18, Litigation, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of legal matters as of December 31, 2007. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its critical estimates and judgments, including, among others, those related to revenue recognition, investments, inventory, research and development expenses, purchase accounting, goodwill impairment, stock based compensation, and income taxes. Those critical estimates and assumptions are based on 66 Table of Contents our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Product Revenues We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, VA rebates, managed care rebates, product returns and other applicable allowances. Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. These estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments that we make with regard to revenue recognition. Royalties We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which we have rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees. Investments We invest in various types of securities, including: short term and long term marketable securities, principally corporate notes and government securities, in which our excess cash balances are invested; equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements; and equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available. These investments are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, or SFAS 115, or APB No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common, or APB 18, as appropriate. In accounting for investments, we evaluate if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is other than temporary, and if so, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income. The factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security, the duration of the securitys decline, prospects for the investee, including favorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, new 67 Table of Contents collaborative agreements and our intent and ability to hold to recovery. The determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on our results. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in, first out, or FIFO, method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements A Replacement of FASB Concepts No. 3, or FASB Concepts Statement No. 6. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval, including safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization. We are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. There is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods. We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs will be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included in costs of goods sold are write downs of commercial inventory that do not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to expiration. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, contract services and other outside expenses. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. The timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense. Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of site management, monitoring costs, and project management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known. 68 Table of Contents Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and In process Research and Development Expenses We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets primarily through the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, an independent third party valuation firm is generally engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets as acquired. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting regulatory approvals; estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. FIN 46(R) Under FIN 46(R),we consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, we consider a number of factors, including determining the expected losses and residual returns of the technologies being developed pursuant to collaborations and other economic risk and reward of such collaborations. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these analyses and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: assuming that the research and development efforts will result in an approved commercial product; estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting timing of regulatory approvals; estimating future cash inflows from product sales or funding from partners resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. For such consolidated entities that we own less than a 100% interest, we record minority interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the outside equity interests. FIN 46(R) impacts the way we account for certain collaborations and future events may result in our consolidation of companies or related entities with which we have a collaborative arrangement. The consolidation of variable interest entities may have a material effect on our financial condition and or results of operation in future periods. Goodwill We annually assess our goodwill balance to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. To do this, in the case of goodwill we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets. Calculating fair value involves identifying future cash flows, which requires that we make a number of critical legal, economic, market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date. We believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Notwithstanding this, our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results, or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment. 69 Table of Contents Share based Compensation We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation. In connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, we use the Black Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions. The key assumptions we make are: the expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the award; and the expected forfeiture rate. In connection with our restricted stock programs, we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments. Income Taxes In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of viable tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we recognized a reduction in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $14.2 million, which was recorded as a $1.8 million reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of our accumulated deficit, a $9.1 million reduction in goodwill and a $3.3 million increase in our deferred tax liability. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions): Balance at January 1, 2007 $ 196.8 Additions based on tax positions related to the current period 29.7 Additions for tax positions of prior periods 83.5 Reductions for tax positions of prior periods (70.2 ) Settlements (18.7 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 221.1 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007, are $110.5 million and $98.2 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues), respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods. New Accounting Standards See Note 26, New Accounting Pronouncements, for a discussion of new accounting standards. 70 Table of Contents Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Controls and Procedures We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2007. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of that period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a companys board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 71 Table of Contents The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have operations in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada in connection with the sale of AVONEX and TYSABRI. We also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through Genentech on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc). We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation. We use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities (for example, a strengthening of the Euro) would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $48.7 million. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account operating transactions. Certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is, therefore, subject to changes in market interest rates. A 100 basis point adverse movement (increase in LIBOR) would increase annual interest expense by approximately $12.2 million. In addition, the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. We estimate that such hypothetical adverse 100 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $18.3 million to our interest rate sensitive instruments. The returns from cash and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change. A 100 basis point adverse movement (decrease) in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $11.5 million. We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. We regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $1.7 million.
