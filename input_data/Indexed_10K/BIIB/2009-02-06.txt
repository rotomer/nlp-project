Unless required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K, beginning on page F 1. Executive Summary Biogen Idec Inc. was formed in 2003 upon the acquisition of Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation in a merger transaction, or the Merger. We are a global biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas of high unmet medical needs. We have two licensed biological bulk manufacturing facilities, including our large scale manufacturing plant in Research Triangle Park, NC, which is one of the worlds largest cell culture facilities. An additional large scale manufacturing plant is under construction in Hillerd, Denmark. We conduct research in San Diego, CA and Cambridge, MA. In 2008, we entered into an agreement with a real estate developer for the construction and leasing of a corporate headquarters in Weston, MA. We anticipate occupancy in 2010. We have additional offices in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, India and throughout Europe, including our international headquarters in Zug, Switzerland and operate a global distribution network, which covers over 70 countries. We currently employ approximately 4,700 people worldwide. Results for the year ended December 31, 2008 included total revenue of $4,097.5 million, net income of $783.2 million and diluted net income per share of $2.65. These results reflect continued growth in unit sales of TYSABRI, an increase in revenues from an unconsolidated joint business arrangement due to increased sales of RITUXAN, as well as the impact of price increases in the United States and the favorable impact of exchange rates in rest of world on our AVONEX product. The effect of the increase in revenue was partially offset by an increase in research and development expense due to increased level of Phase 3 clinical trials and other projects, and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense related to a higher level of personnel to sustain AVONEX sales and drive TYSABRI growth. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed a reorganization of our domestic and 38 Table of Contents international operations, which included the movement of certain personnel and operational functions between Biogen Idec subsidiaries, as well as a restructuring of our supply chain. Marketed Products We currently have four marketed products: AVONEX (interferon beta 1a); RITUXAN (rituximab); TYSABRI (natalizumab); FUMADERM (dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts) Through December 2007 we recorded product revenue from sales of ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan) in the U.S. In December 2007, we sold the U.S. marketing, sales, manufacturing and development rights of ZEVALIN to Cell Therapeutics, Inc., or CTI, for an upfront purchase price of $10.0 million. In December 2008, pursuant to an amendment of the agreement, we received an additional $2.2 million milestone payment. We may receive up to an additional $20.0 million in milestone payments. In addition, we will receive royalty payments on future sales of ZEVALIN. As part of the overall agreement, we entered into a supply agreement with CTI to sell ZEVALIN product through 2014. Our sales of ZEVALIN to Bayer Schering Pharma AG, or Schering AG, for distribution in the EU will be recognized as product revenue and our supply of ZEVALIN to CTI is recognized as corporate partner revenue. We will continue to receive royalty revenues from Schering AG on their sales of ZEVALIN in the EU. The $10.0 million upfront and $2.2 million milestone payment have been deferred and are being recognized in our results of operations over the term of the supply agreement. Through April 2006, we recorded product revenues from sales of AMEVIVE (alefacept). In April 2006, we sold the worldwide rights to this product to Astellas Pharma US, Inc., or Astellas. We will continue to manufacture and supply this product to Astellas for a period of up to 11 years. Under the terms of the supply agreement, we charge Astellas fixed amounts based on volume. Such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and are not significant. Most of our revenues are currently dependent on sales of AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI. In the near term, we are dependent on the continued sales growth of TYSABRI to grow our overall revenues. In the longer term, our revenue growth is dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products currently being developed in our pipeline or products or programs that will be in licensed or acquired. Continued growth of global AVONEX unit sales is primarily dependent on maintaining AVONEXs position as the most prescribed multiple sclerosis, or MS, therapy in the world. In both the U.S. and rest of world, we face increasing competition in the MS market from currently marketed products and future products in late stage development, as well as increasing pricing pressure. We continue to generate data showing AVONEX to be an effective and safe choice for MS patients and physicians. The majority of RITUXAN unit sales are currently from use in the oncology setting. We believe there is additional room for RITUXAN unit sales growth in the immunology setting, where RITUXAN is currently approved for patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, or RA, with inadequate response to anti tumor necrosis factor therapies, or TNF IR. Additional immunology indications for RITUXAN that we are investigating include earlier stage RA patients with inadequate response to disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs, or DMARD IR patients, DMARD nave RA patients and lupus nephritis and ANCA associated vaculitis. In July 2006, we reintroduced TYSABRI in the U.S. and began to ship internationally for the first time. TYSABRI sales are currently for use in relapsing remitting MS and, following the FDAs approval in January 2008, Crohns disease. Growth in TYSABRI revenue will be dependent on the generation of a larger and longer term safety database, as well as continued acceptance by physicians and MS patients. Since the reintroduction of TYSABRI in the U.S. and the introduction of TYSABRI in the rest of world, we have disclosed five cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, a known side effect, in patients taking TYSABRI in the post 39 Table of Contents marketing setting. These patients were the only confirmed cases of PML reported to us during this period. We continue to monitor the growth of TYSABRI unit sales in light of this news and we continue to develop protocols to potentially mitigate the risk and outcome of PML in patients being treated with TYSABRI. Clinical Studies Over the past few years, we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels. For 2009, we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures. We have a number of pipeline products in late stage clinical trials, including over 13 pipeline products in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials. We are currently developing the late stage product candidates that are set forth below. Development and or Marketing Product Product Indications Status Collaborators BG 12 Relapsing MS Phase 3 None Anti CD80 MAb (galiximab) Relapsed NHL Phase 3 None Anti CD23 MAb (lumiliximab) Relapsed CLL Phase 2/3 None Humanized Anti CD20 MAb (ocrelizumab) RA Phase 3 U.S. Genentech Japan Chugai and Zenyaku Outside U.S. and Japan Roche Lupus nephritis Phase 3 See above Lixivaptan Hyponatremia, commonly seen in acute decompensated heart failure Phase 3 Cardiokine Biopharma LLC ADENTRI Acute decompensated heart failure with renal insufficiency Phase 3 None In addition to the expense associated with these late stage trials, other pipeline products are in ongoing or are expected to enter proof of concept trials in 2009. Business Development As part of our business strategy, we have made acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. Our cash reserves and other liquid assets are substantial, but these sources of capital may be inadequate to consummate larger acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete transactions. Due to the recent tightening of global credit and the disruption in the financial markets, it may be more difficult to secure such additional financing. In addition, as a result of our acquisition efforts, we may experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses that may include transaction costs, closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues Revenues were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Product Sales United States $ 1,472.9 35.9 % $ 1,203.6 37.9 % $ 1,069.5 40.0 % Rest of world 1,366.8 33.4 % 933.2 29.5 % 711.8 26.5 % Total product revenues 2,839.7 69.3 % 2,136.8 67.4 % 1,781.3 66.5 % Unconsolidated Joint Business 1,128.2 27.5 % 926.1 29.2 % 810.9 30.2 % Other Revenues 129.6 3.2 % 108.7 3.4 % 90.8 3.3 % Total revenues $ 4,097.5 100.0 % $ 3,171.6 100.0 % $ 2,683.0 100.0 % Product Revenues Product revenues were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AVONEX $ 2,202.6 77.6 % $ 1,867.8 87.4 % $ 1,706.7 95.9 % TYSABRI 588.6 20.7 % 229.9 10.8 % 35.8 2.0 % FUMADERM 43.4 1.5 % 21.5 1.0 % 9.5 0.5 % ZEVALIN 4.8 0.2 % 16.9 0.8 % 17.8 1.0 % AMEVIVE 0.3 % 0.7 11.5 0.6 % Total product revenues $ 2,839.7 100.0 % $ 2,136.8 100.0 % $ 1,781.3 100.0 % Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Cost of product revenues $ 397.0 98.8 % $ 330.5 98.6 % $ 270.0 98.4 % Cost of royalty revenues 5.0 1.2 % 4.7 1.4 % 4.4 1.6 % Cost of sales $ 402.0 100.0 % $ 335.2 100.0 % $ 274.4 100.0 % During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we wrote down approximately $29.8 million, $21.6 million, and $13.0 million, respectively, of inventory which was charged to cost of sales. 41 Table of Contents Cost of Product Revenues Cost of product revenues, included in cost of sales, by product are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AVONEX $ 272.0 68.5 % $ 258.3 78.2 % $ 234.7 86.9 % TYSABRI 68.5 17.3 % 10.4 3.1 % 5.3 2.0 % FUMADERM 3.9 1.0 % 1.6 0.5 % 3.1 1.2 % ZEVALIN 5.6 1.4 % 14.0 4.2 % 16.2 6.0 % AMEVIVE 8.0 2.0 % 3.1 0.9 % 10.0 3.7 % Other 39.0 9.8 % 43.1 13.1 % 0.7 0.2 % Cost of product revenues $ 397.0 100.0 % $ 330.5 100.0 % $ 270.0 100.0 % AVONEX Revenues from AVONEX were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AVONEX U.S. $ 1,276.5 58.0 % $ 1,085.0 58.1 % $ 1,022.2 59.9 % Rest of world 926.1 42.0 % 782.8 41.9 % 684.5 40.1 % Total AVONEX revenues $ 2,202.6 100.0 % $ 1,867.8 100.0 % $ 1,706.7 100.0 % For 2008 compared to 2007, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased $191.5 million, or 17.6%, due to price increases, partially offset by decreased product demand. For 2008 compared to 2007, rest of world sales of AVONEX increased $143.3 million, or 18.3%, due to increased unit shipments, the impact of exchange rates and the establishment of additional direct market affiliates. For 2007 compared to 2006, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased $62.8 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to the impact of price increases. These increases were offset by lower demand. For 2007 compared to 2006, rest of world sales of AVONEX increased $98.3 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to the impact of exchange rates and higher sales volume. We expect to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace in both the U.S. and rest of world from existing and new MS treatments, including TYSABRI and our other pipeline products, which may have a negative impact to the unit sales of AVONEX. We expect future unit sales of AVONEX to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. TYSABRI Revenues from TYSABRI were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 TYSABRI U.S. $ 196.4 33.4 % $ 104.4 45.4 % $ 25.8 72.1 % Rest of world 392.2 66.6 % 125.5 54.6 % 10.0 27.9 % Total TYSABRI revenues $ 588.6 100.0 % $ 229.9 100.0 % $ 35.8 100.0 % Under the terms of a collaboration agreement with Elan, we manufacture TYSABRI and collaborate with Elan on the products marketing, commercial distribution and on going development activities. We recognize revenue 42 Table of Contents for sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. upon Elans shipment of the product to third party distributors. We recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI in rest of world at the time of product delivery to our customers and distributors. Since the reintroduction of TYSABRI in the U.S. and the introduction of TYSABRI in the rest of world in July 2006, we have disclosed five cases of PML, a known side effect, in patients taking TYSABRI in the post marketing setting. These patients were the only confirmed cases of PML reported to us during this period. We continue to monitor the growth of TYSABRI unit sales in light of these results and we continue to develop protocols to potentially mitigate the risk and outcome of PML in patients being treated with TYSABRI. For 2008 and 2007, we recorded revenue on sales of TYSABRI of $588.6 million and $229.9 million, respectively. The increase in 2008 sales as compared to 2007 sales is primarily due to increased unit shipments due to the growth in the number of patients using TYSABRI. For 2007 and 2006, we have recorded revenue on sales of TYSABRI of $229.9 million and $35.8 million, respectively. The increase in 2007 sales as compared to 2006 sales is primarily due to increased unit shipments due to the growth in the number of patients using TYSABRI and due to the product being shipped for the entire 12 months during 2007 versus being shipped for only six months in 2006. During 2007 and 2006, we had product on hand that had been fully written off in 2005 due to the uncertainties surrounding the TYSABRI suspension but which was available to fill future orders. As we sold TYSABRI in 2007 and 2006, we realized lower than normal cost of sales and, therefore, higher margins, as we shipped the inventory that had been previously written off. For 2007 and 2006, cost of sales was approximately $12.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, lower due to the sale of TYSABRI that had been previously written off. All TYSABRI inventory that had been previously written off had been shipped by December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Elan, Elan paid us a $75.0 million milestone payment in order to maintain the current collaboration profit sharing split. We recorded this amount as deferred revenue upon receipt and are recognizing this $75.0 million as product revenue in our consolidated statement of income over the term of our collaboration with Elan based on a units of revenue method whereby the revenue recognized is based on the ratio of units shipped in the current period over the total units expected to be shipped over the remaining term of the collaboration. We recognized $1.5 million of this milestone as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008. Based on the TYSABRI sales levels achieved through the fourth quarter of 2008, in January 2009, Elan paid us an additional milestone payment of $50.0 million in order to maintain the current collaboration profit sharing split. Revenue from this milestone payment will also be deferred and recognized on a units of revenue model. FUMADERM In connection with our June 2006 acquisition of Fumapharm, we began recognizing revenue on sales of FUMADERM to our distributor, Fumedica, in July 2006. In December 2006, we acquired the right to distribute FUMADERM in Germany from Fumedica effective May 1, 2007. In connection with the acquisition of the FUMADERM distribution rights in Germany, we committed to the repurchase of any inventory Fumedica did not sell by May 1, 2007. As a result of this provision, we deferred the recognition of revenue on shipments made to Fumedica through April 30, 2007. We resumed recognizing revenue on sales of FUMADERM into the German market in May 2007. Sales of FUMADERM for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $43.4 million, $21.5 million, and $9.5 million, respectively. These increases in sales were primarily due to increased volumes. ZEVALIN In 2008, 2007, and 2006 sales of ZEVALIN were $4.8 million, $16.9 million, and $17.8 million, respectively. The decrease in total ZEVALIN sales in 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily due to the sale of the rights to market, sell, manufacture, and develop ZEVALIN in the U.S. to CTI during the fourth quarter of 2007. Beginning in 2008, ZEVALIN product revenue consists only of ZEVALIN sales to Schering AG. 43 Table of Contents AMEVIVE In 2008, 2007, and 2006, sales of AMEVIVE were $0.3 million, $0.7 million, and $11.5 million, respectively. The decrease in total AMEVIVE sales is due to the sale, in April 2006, of our worldwide rights and infrastructure related to sales, production, and marketing of AMEVIVE to Astellas. Although we sold the rights to this product, we continue to report a small amount of product revenues related to shipments made by certain of our overseas joint ventures, which we consolidate. Provisions for Discounts and Allowances Revenues from product sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration, or VA, rebates, managed care rebates, product returns, other applicable allowances and, in 2006, patient assistance and patient replacement goods. The estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent significant judgments. Effective January 1, 2007, we changed the manner in which we administer our patient assistance and patient replacement goods programs. Prior to January 1, 2007, AVONEX product shipped for these programs was invoiced and recorded as gross product revenue and an offsetting provision for discount and returns was recorded for expected credit requests from the distributor that administers these programs on our behalf (as such, no net revenue was recorded for these shipments). Effective January 1, 2007, we entered into a new arrangement with a distributor. Under the new sales model, gross revenue is not recorded for product shipped to satisfy these programs, and cost of sales is recorded when the product is shipped. Provisions for discounts and allowances reduced gross product revenues as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Discounts $ 67.1 $ 45.7 $ 102.9 Contractual adjustments 149.0 105.2 93.3 Returns 12.2 22.1 38.7 Total allowances $ 228.3 $ 173.0 $ 234.9 Gross product revenues $ 3,068.0 $ 2,309.8 $ 2,016.2 Percent of gross product revenues 7.4 % 7.5 % 11.7 % 44 Table of Contents An analysis of the amount of, and change in, reserves is as follows (in millions): Contractual Discounts Adjustments Returns Total 2008 Beginning Balance $ 6.4 $ 33.1 $ 20.4 $ 59.9 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 67.1 150.6 14.7 232.4 Adjustments relating to prior years (1.6 ) (2.5 ) (4.1 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (57.8 ) (101.2 ) (0.1 ) (159.1 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (6.5 ) (32.8 ) (14.4 ) (53.7 ) Ending Balance $ 9.2 $ 48.1 $ 18.1 $ 75.4 2007 Beginning Balance $ 12.7 $ 30.5 $ 17.8 $ 61.0 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 45.7 113.1 17.1 175.9 Adjustments relating to prior years (7.9 ) 5.0 (2.9 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (39.4 ) (72.3 ) (0.4 ) (112.1 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (12.6 ) (30.3 ) (19.1 ) (62.0 ) Ending Balance $ 6.4 $ 33.1 $ 20.4 $ 59.9 2006 Beginning Balance $ 11.6 $ 35.7 $ 2.3 $ 49.6 Current provisions relating to sales in current year 102.9 96.4 31.6 230.9 Adjustments relating to prior years (3.1 ) 7.1 4.0 Payments/returns relating to sales in current year (90.2 ) (63.1 ) (16.1 ) (169.4 ) Payments/returns relating to sales in prior years (11.6 ) (35.4 ) (12.5 ) (59.5 ) Other adjustments 5.4 5.4 Ending Balance $ 12.7 $ 30.5 $ 17.8 $ 61.0 Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual requirements, statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. Product revenue reserves are categorized as follows: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns. Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives and, in 2006, patient assistance. For 2008 compared to 2007, discounts increased $21.4 million, or 46.8%, primarily resulting from increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives as a result of price increases. For 2007 compared to 2006, discounts decreased $57.2 million, or 55.6%, resulting from a $67.5 million reduction related to the change of patient assistance to a consignment model, offset by increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives. Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid, VA and managed care rebates and other applicable allowances. For 2008 compared to 2007, contractual adjustments increased $43.8 million, or 41.6%, primarily due to the impact of higher reserves for managed care (associated with higher level of activity with respect to rebates and 2008 price increases in the U.S.) and Medicaid and VA programs (associated with 2007 price increases in the U.S.). For 2007 compared to 2006, contractual adjustments increased $11.9 million, or 12.8%, primarily due to the impact of higher reserves for managed care (associated with higher level of activity with respect to rebates and associated with 2007 price increases in the U.S.) and Medicaid and VA programs (associated with 2007 price increases in the U.S.). Product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers and our patient replacement goods program in 2006. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from our patients for various reasons. For 2008 compared to 45 Table of Contents 2007, return reserves decreased $9.9 million, or 44.8%, primarily due to a decrease in estimated product returns. For 2007 compared to 2006, return reserves decreased $16.6 million, or 42.9%, primarily due to a $15.0 million decrease related to patient replacement goods under the new sales model. Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data, as adjusted, to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product. Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenues We have a collaboration with Genentech Inc., or Genentech, that was created and operates by agreement rather than through a joint venture or other legal entity. Our rights under the terms of our amended and restated collaboration agreement with Genentech include co exclusive rights to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in the United States and Canada with Genentech. Genentech has the exclusive right to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in the rest of the world. We have assigned our rights to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in Canada to F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd., or Roche. Genentech shares a portion of the pretax U.S. co promotion profits with us and Roche shares a portion of the pretax Canadian co promotion profits of RITUXAN with us. In the U.S., we contribute resources to selling and the continued development of RITUXAN. Genentech is responsible for worldwide manufacturing of RITUXAN. Genentech also is responsible for the primary support functions for the commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. including selling and marketing, customer service, order entry, distribution, shipping and billing. Genentech also incurs the majority of continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Under the arrangement, we have a limited sales force as well as limited development activity. Under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between Genentech and Roche, Roche is responsible for commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S., except in Japan where RITUXAN is co marketed by Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd., or Zenyaku, and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, or Chugai, an affiliate of Roche. There is no direct contractual arrangement between us and Roche, Zenyaku or Chugai. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consists of (1) our share of pretax co promotion profits in the U.S. and Canada and (2) royalty revenue from sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and Canada by Roche, Zenyaku and Chugai. Pre tax co promotion profits are calculated and paid to us by Genentech in the U.S. and by Roche in Canada. Pre tax co promotion profits consist of U.S. and Canadian sales of RITUXAN to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling, and marketing expenses, and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech, Roche and us. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 733.5 $ 616.8 $ 555.8 Reimbursement of selling and development expenses in the U.S. 59.7 58.5 61.1 Revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. 335.0 250.8 194.0 $ 1,128.2 $ 926.1 $ 810.9 46 Table of Contents Co promotion profits in the U.S. consist of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Product revenues, net $ 2,587.4 $ 2,284.8 $ 2,071.2 Costs and expenses 741.0 730.2 669.3 Co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 1,846.4 $ 1,554.6 $ 1,401.9 Biogen Idecs share of co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 733.5 $ 616.8 $ 555.8 Net sales of RITUXAN to third party customers in the U.S. recorded by Genentech for 2008 were $2,587.4 million compared to $2,284.8 million in 2007, and $2,071.2 million in 2006. These increases were primarily due to increased unit sales in treatments of B cell NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (an unapproved use of RITUXAN), increased utilization for RA and increases in the wholesale price of RITUXAN. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, reimbursements of selling and development expenses in the U.S. were $59.7 million, $58.5 million and $61.1 million, respectively. The increase in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to development costs we incurred related to the development of RITUXAN in RA. The decrease in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to the reimbursement of development costs when Roche exercised its option to participate in the relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis development program. Revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. consists of our share of co promotion profits in Canada and royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and Canada. Our royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN is based on Roche, Zenyaku and Chugais net sales to third party customers. We record our royalty revenue and co promotion profit revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a cash basis. Revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $335.0 million, $250.8 million, and $194.0 million, respectively. These increases were due to several factors, including increased market penetration. The royalty period with respect to all products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis. For the majority of European countries, the first commercial sale of RITUXAN occurred in the second half of 1998. Therefore, we expect a significant decrease in royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the US and Canada beginning in the latter half of 2009. Specifically, the royalty period with respect to sales in France, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom will expire in 2009. As a result, royalty revenue is expected to be in the range of $250.0 million to $290.0 million in 2009. The royalty period with respect to sales in Italy will expire in 2010. The royalty period with respect to sales in other countries will expire through 2012. Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our current pretax co promotion profit sharing formula, which resets annually, is as follows: Biogen Idecs Share Co promotion Operating Profits of Co promotion Profits First $50 million 30 % Greater than $50 million 40 % In 2008, 2007, and 2006, the 40% threshold was met during the first quarter. 47 Table of Contents For each calendar year or portion thereof following the approval date of the first New Anti CD20 Product, the pretax co promotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and New Anti CD20 Products sold by us and Genentech will change. Biogen Idecs Share of First New Anti CD20 Product U.S. Co promotion Co promotion Operating Profits Gross Product Sales Profits First $50 million(1) N/A 30 % Greater than $50 million Until such sales exceed $150 million in any calendar year(2) 38 % Or After such sales exceed $150 million in any calendar year until such sales exceed $350 million in any calendar year(3) 35 % Or After such sales exceed $350 million in any calendar year(4) 30 % (1) not applicable in the calendar year the first New Anti CD20 Product is approved if $50 million in co promotion operating profits has already been achieved in such calendar year through sales of RITUXAN. (2) if we are recording our share of RITUXAN co promotion profits at 40%, upon the approval date of the first New Anti CD20 Product, our share of co promotion profits for RITUXAN and the New Anti CD20 Product will be immediately reduced to 38% following the approval date of the first New Anti CD20 Product until the $150 million in first New Anti CD20 Product sales level is achieved. (3) if $150 million in first New Anti CD20 Product sales is achieved in the same calendar year the first New Anti CD20 Product receives approval, then the 35% co promotion profit sharing rate will not be effective until January 1 of the following calendar year. Once the $150 million in first New Anti CD20 Product sales level is achieved then our share of co promotion profits for the balance of the year and all subsequent years (after the first $50 million in co promotion operating profits in such years) will be 35% until the $350 million in first New Anti CD20 Product sales level is achieved. (4) if $350 million in first New Anti CD20 Product sales is achieved in the same calendar year that $150 million in new product sales is achieved, then the 30% co promotion profit sharing rate will not be effective until January 1 of the following calendar year (or January 1 of the second following calendar year if the first New Anti CD20 Product receives approval and, in the same calendar year, the $150 million and $350 million in first New Anti CD20 Product sales levels are achieved). Once the $350 million in first New Anti CD20 Product sales level is achieved then our share of co promotion profits for the balance of the year and all subsequent years will be 30%. Currently, we record our share of expenses incurred for the development of New Anti CD20 Products in research and development expense until such time as a New Anti CD20 Product is approved, at which time we will record our share of pretax co promotion profits related to the New Anti CD20 Product in revenues from unconsolidated joint business. Under our collaboration agreement with Genentech, we will receive a lower royalty percentage of revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of New Anti CD20 Products, as compared to the royalty percentage of revenue on sales of RITUXAN. In 2008, under the terms of our collaboration agreement, we paid Genentech $31.5 million to participate in a license agreement with Roche for the development of a Third Party Anti CD20 Product. This was recorded as research and development cost in our consolidated statement of operations as the product had no alternative future use. In addition, in 2008 we received $12.4 million from Genentech pursuant to Roche choosing to participate in a study of RITUXAN in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. This was recorded as revenue from unconsolidated joint business in our consolidated statement of operations. 48 Table of Contents Other Revenue Other revenues consist of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Royalties $ 116.2 89.7 % $ 102.1 93.9 % $ 86.2 94.9 % Corporate partner 13.4 10.3 % 6.6 6.1 % 4.6 5.1 % $ 129.6 100.0 % $ 108.7 100.0 % $ 90.8 100.0 % Royalty Revenues We receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control. Our royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. are included in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For 2008 compared to 2007, royalty revenue increased $14.1 million, or 13.8%, primarily due to an increase in sales levels of certain products under license partially offset by the expiration of certain contracts and decreased sales level of certain products under license. For 2007 compared to 2006, royalty revenues increased $15.9 million, or 18.4%, primarily due to an increase in sales levels of products under license partially offset by the expiration of royalties under certain contracts. Royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs. Corporate Partner Revenues Corporate partner revenues represent contract revenues such as ZEVALIN and AMEVIVE and license fees. Costs and Expenses Costs and expenses are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 402.0 13.9 % $ 335.2 14.0 % $ 274.4 12.3 % Research and development 1,072.1 37.2 % 925.2 38.7 % 718.4 32.0 % Selling, general, and administrative 925.3 32.1 % 776.1 32.4 % 685.0 30.5 % Collaboration profit (loss) sharing 136.0 4.7 % 14.0 0.6 % (9.7 ) (0.4 )% Acquired in process research and development 25.0 0.9 % 84.2 3.5 % 330.5 14.7 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 332.7 11.5 % 257.5 10.8 % 267.0 11.9 % Facility impairments and (gain) loss on disposition, net (9.2 ) (0.3 )% (0.4 ) (16.5 ) (0.7 )% Gain on termination of license agreements, net (6.1 ) (0.3 )% Total costs and expenses $ 2,883.9 100.0 % $ 2,391.8 100.0 % $ 2,243.0 100.0 % Inventory Write Offs We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that 49 Table of Contents estimated by us, or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or that became obsolete due to expiration. In all cases product inventory was written down to its estimated net realizable value. The shelf life associated with our products is generally between 3 and 48 months, depending on the product. Obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern, given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel. Changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us. We do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business. We have written down the following inventory, which was charged to cost of sales (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AVONEX $ 14.9 $ 11.1 $ 4.4 TYSABRI 7.6 4.0 2.9 FUMADERM 0.1 AMEVIVE 6.0 0.1 2.4 ZEVALIN 1.3 6.3 3.3 $ 29.8 $ 21.6 $ 13.0 The write downs were the result of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Failed quality specifications $ 16.0 $ 12.0 $ 11.2 Excess and or obsolescence 13.8 9.6 1.8 $ 29.8 $ 21.6 $ 13.0 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses totaled $1,072.1 million in 2008 compared to $925.2 million in 2007, and $718.4 million in 2006. For 2008 compared to 2007, research and development expenses increased $146.9 million, driven by an increase of $56.4 million related to the continued advancement of our pipeline into Phase 3 clinical trials. In 2008, we initiated registrational trials in the Lixivaptan and Adentri programs and continued to execute development plans of our BG 12, Anti CD23, and Anti CD80 programs. Costs associated with Phase 3 clinical trials are, in most cases, more significant than those incurred in earlier stages of our pipeline. In 2008, we had 8 programs in Phase 3 clinical trials as compared to 5 in 2007. We also increased spend in our Anti CD20 programs, which is being developed in both Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials by $46.2 million primarily due to a $31.5 million opt in payment to participate in the Roche led GA101 program. The balance of the increase of $44.3 million is due to other research and development investments, primarily in our pre clinical and early stage pipeline programs including HSP90, BIIB014, BART and LINGO programs. For 2007 compared to 2006, research and development expenses increased $206.8 million, primarily due to an increase of $129.1 million related to the continued advancement of our late stage pipeline which includes a $50.0 million upfront payment to Cardiokine Biopharma LLC for the Lixivaptan collaboration entered into in August of 2007. In addition, in 2007, we initiated registrational trials for the Anti CD23 and BG 12 programs. In 2007, we had 5 programs in Phase 3 clinical trials as compared to 3 in 2006. The balance of the $77.7 million is due to other research and development investments, primarily in pre clinical and early stage pipeline programs driven by 50 Table of Contents our business development deals with Syntonix and Conforma, as well as increased spend for the Baminercept alpha (LTBR Fc) program in anticipation of the 2007 and 2008 data read outs. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in 2009 primarily due to the greater number of product candidates in late stage clinical trials. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $925.3 million in 2008 compared to $776.1 million in 2007, and $685.1 million in 2006. For 2008 compared to 2007, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $149.2 million, or 19.2%, primarily due to a $90.0 million increase in sales and marketing, of which $55.3 million related to international sales and marketing activities primarily for AVONEX and TYSABRI and a $43.6 million increase in salaries and benefits related to general and administrative personnel as well as increases in fees and services. For 2007 compared to 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $91.0 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to a $65.0 million increase in sales and marketing activities for TYSABRI, primarily in international sales and marketing, a $25.5 million net increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount in general and administrative personnel, a $19.0 million increase in fees and services related to general and administrative matters offset by a $12.1 million decrease in sales and marketing activities for ZEVALIN due to decreased commercial efforts due to the planned divestiture of this product line. We do not anticipate a significant increase in total selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2009 as compared to the amount incurred in 2008. Severance and Other Restructuring Costs Severance and other restructuring costs totaled $5.0 million in 2008 as compared to $1.8 million in 2007 and $3.6 million in 2006. These costs are included in research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2008, there are no remaining material severance or restructuring accruals on our consolidated balance sheet. Amortization of Intangible Assets For 2008, 2007, and 2006, amortization expense was $332.7 million, $257.5 million, and $267.0 million, respectively. Our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our AVONEX product. Our amortization policy for our core technology intangible asset is based on the principles of Statement of Financial Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS 142, which requires the amortization of intangible assets to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. Every year during the third quarter we complete our long range planning cycle, which includes an analysis of the anticipated product sales of AVONEX. The results of this forecast serve as the basis for our assumptions used in the economic consumption amortization model for our core technology intangible asset. We also establish minimum annual amortization amounts to ensure amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods. See Note 1, Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a detailed description of our accounting policy for amortization of intangible assets. For 2008 compared to 2007, amortization expense increased $75.2 million, or 29.2%, primarily due to the changes in the estimate of the future revenue of AVONEX, which serves as the basis for the calculation of economic consumption for core technology that occurred as part of our annual reassessment of amortization expense in the third quarters of 2008 and 2007. The change in the estimate of the future revenue of AVONEX is attributable to the expected impact of competitor products, including commercialization of our own pipeline product candidates. For 2007 compared to 2006, amortization expense decreased $9.5 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to the changes in estimate of the future revenue of AVONEX, which serves as the basis in our calculation of economic consumption for core technology. 51 Table of Contents We review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. No such events or changes in circumstances occurred in 2008. If future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations. In Process Research and Development (IPRD) For 2008, 2007, and 2006, IPRD charges were $25.0 million, $84.2 million, and $330.5 million, respectively. In 2008, we recorded an IPRD charge of $25.0 million related to a HSP90 related milestone payment made to the former shareholders of Conforma, pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of Conforma in 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded IPRD charges of $84.2 million. The principal components of this amount are as follows: $18.4 million related to the acquisition of Syntonix, approximately $30 million related to the collaboration with Cardiokine Biopharma LLC, or Cardiokine and $34.3 million related to the collaboration with Neurimmune. Cardiokine and Neurimmune are variable interest entities, as defined in FIN 46(R). The consolidation of these entities resulted in IPRD charges. The IPRD charges have been recorded as a component of operating income. However, because the IPRD charges relate to the fair value of the underlying technology retained by the parent companies of Cardiokine and Neurimmune, these amounts were allocated to the respective minority interests. Consequently, minority interest of $64.3 million was recorded as a component of non operating income. In 2006, we recorded $207.4 million and $123.1 million in IPRD related to the acquisitions of Fumapharm and Conforma, respectively. Through December 31, 2008, research and development expenditures related to in process research and development projects acquired in prior years are $42.9 million, $36.3 million, and $129.3 million related to Syntonix, Conforma, and Fumapharm, respectively. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, and Note 16, Research Collaborations of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Facility Impairments and (Gain) Loss on Disposition, net In 2008, as part of the lease agreement described in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, we sold the development rights on a parcel of land in Cambridge, MA in a non monetary transaction for $11.4 million. We recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $9.2 million on the sale. In 2006, we completed the sale of one of the buildings in our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility, known as Bio 1. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $39.5 million. We recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $15.6 million on the sale. We continued to occupy a minor portion of the building under a leasing arrangement. In 2006, we also sold our clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known as NICO for total consideration of $29.0 million. We recorded an immaterial net gain pursuant to this transaction. Gain on Settlement of License Agreements, net In 2006, we recorded a net gain on settlement of license agreements, net of $6.1 million as discussed below. Fumapharm During 2006, we recorded a gain of $34.2 million coincident with the acquisition of Fumapharm in accordance with EITF 04 1, Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination, or EITF 04 1. The gain related to the settlement of a preexisting collaboration agreement between Fumapharm and us. The collaboration agreement was entered into in October 2003 and required payments to Fumapharm of certain royalty amounts. The market rate for such payments was higher at the acquisition date, primarily due to the increased technical feasibility of BG 12. The gain relates to the difference between the royalty rates at the time the agreement was entered into as compared to the rates at the time the agreement was effectively settled by virtue of our acquisition of Fumapharm. 52 Table of Contents Fumedica During 2006, we recorded a charge of $28.1 million in connection with a settlement agreement with Fumedica Arzneimittel AG and Fumedica Arzneimittel GmbH, collectively Fumedica. The charge related to the settlement of the agreement with Fumedica under which we were contingently obligated to make royalty payments with respect to a successful launch of BG 12 for psoriasis in Germany. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we will not be required to make any royalty payments to Fumedica if BG 12 is successfully launched for psoriasis in Germany. The $28.1 million was expensed in 2006, as it related to a product that had not reached technological feasibility. Share based Compensation Expense In the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recorded share based compensation expense of $146.2 million, and $123.1 million, respectively, associated with SFAS 123(R). In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded share based compensation expense of $126.8 million associated with SFAS 123(R), which is net of a cumulative effect pre tax adjustment of $5.6 million, or $3.8 million after tax. The cumulative effect results from the application of an estimated forfeiture rate for current and prior period unvested restricted stock awards. Our share based compensation programs consist of share based awards granted to employees including stock options, restricted stock, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted stock units, or RSUs, as well as our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. The fair value of performance based stock units is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level will be achieved. Compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the outcome of performance related conditions until the vesting date. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 72.1 $ 103.6 $ 101.2 Interest expense (52.0 ) (40.5 ) (0.9 ) Impairments of investments (60.3 ) (24.4 ) (34.4 ) Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net (1.1 ) 16.7 (2.8 ) Minority interest income (expense) (6.9 ) 58.4 (6.8 ) Foreign exchange gains (losses), net (9.8 ) 3.0 4.9 Settlement of litigation and claims 0.1 (4.6 ) Gain on sale of property 7.1 Other, net (6.7 ) 6.8 (4.5 ) Total other income (expense), net $ (64.7 ) $ 130.8 $ 52.1 Interest Income For 2008 compared to 2007, interest income decreased $31.5 million, or 30.4%, primarily due to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to the funding of our tender offer in July 2007, a net payment of $525.5 million for our term loan facility and other debt, and lower investment yields. For 2007 compared to 2006, interest income increased $2.4 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to higher yields offset by a reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to the funding of our tender offer in July 2007. We expect that further reductions in yields may impact our interest income in 2009. Interest Expense For 2008 compared to 2007, interest expense increased $11.5 million, or 28.4%, primarily due to an increased average debt balance in 2008 as compared to 2007 as well as $8.9 million due to the impact of hedge ineffectiveness 53 Table of Contents as discussed in Note 4, Financial Instruments. For 2007 compared to 2006, interest expense increased $39.6 million, primarily due to the increased debt levels relating to our tender offer funded in July 2007 (see Note 21, Tender Offer). As discussed in Note 4, Financial Instruments, in 2008 we terminated certain interest rate swaps. Upon termination of the swaps, the carrying amount of the 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2018 increased by $62.8 million as it was accounted for as a fair value hedge. This amount will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense and amortized using the effective interest rate method over the remaining life of the Senior Notes. Impairment on Investments In 2008, the impairment on investments was due to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of marketable debt securities of $41.7 million related primarily to non agency mortgage and asset backed securities and corporate securities classified as available for sale as well as other than temporary declines in the fair values of our strategic investments of $18.6 million. In 2007 and 2006, the impairment of investments is primarily due to the other than temporary decline in value in our strategic investments portfolio. We may incur additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. Minority Interest For 2008 compared to 2007, minority interest decreased $65.3 million, primarily due to the recording in 2007 of $64.3 million in minority interest pursuant to the initial consolidation of Cardiokine in August 2007 and Neurimmune in November 2007. For 2007 compared to 2006, minority interest increased $65.2 million, also primarily due to the initial consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune in 2007. The minority interest related to Cardiokine and Neurimmune recorded in 2007 offset an equal charge to IPRD, which resulted in no net impact to our results of operations for these IPRD and minority interest charges. Excluding the impact of these consolidations, minority interest expense was $6.9 million, $5.9 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gain on Sale of Property In 2007, we sold approximately 28 acres of land in Oceanside, California for $16.5 million. We recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $7.1 million on the sale. Income Tax Provision Due to tax law changes in certain jurisdictions, during 2008 we completed a reorganization of our domestic and international corporate structure and moved certain personnel and operational functions between affiliates. We anticipate the restructuring will impact amounts subject to future taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We anticipate the changes in our international structure will have a slight unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate for 2009 and beyond, as compared to our tax rate in 2008. We do not anticipate that the domestic reorganization will have a significant impact on our tax rate in 2009 and beyond as compared to our 2008 tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 31.8%, 29.9% and 56.6% on pre tax income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2008 was higher than that in 2007, primarily due to an increased percentage of our foreign earnings being subject to U.S. income tax and the effects of our reorganization of our international operations during 2008, partially offset by certain tax credits and deferred tax assets which will be realized, as a result of our domestic reorganization. Our effective rate for 2006 was higher than the rate for 2007 primarily due to the write off of non deductible IPRD in connection with the acquisitions of Conforma and Fumapharm, offset by a non deductible gain on settlement of the Fumapharm license agreement, and the impact of acquisition related intangible amortization related to foreign jurisdictions and state taxes, offset by the effect of lower income tax in certain non U.S. jurisdictions. Refer to Note 15, Income Taxes, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for full income tax rate reconciliations for 2008, 2007 and 2006. 54 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial condition is summarized as follows (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 622.4 $ 659.7 Marketable securities and loaned securities current and non current 1,640.4 1,456.1 Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (including loaned securities) $ 2,262.8 $ 2,115.8 Working capital $ 1,534.8 $ 179.2 Outstanding borrowings current and non current $ 1,113.1 $ 1,563.0 Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2008, are relatively consistent with the balances at December 31, 2007. However, there were several significant cash flow activities including the net repayment of approximately $513.0 million of indebtedness, $738.9 million used to fund share repurchases, as well as $276.0 used to purchase property plant and equipment offset by cash generated from operations of $1,566.5 million and cash received from the termination of our interest rate swaps of $53.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid approximately $72.5 million in milestone and other payments pursuant to our research and development programs, including $31.5 million pursuant to our Genentech agreement, $25.0 million of contingent purchase price in connection with our Conforma acquisition and $10.5 million related to the development of the Beta Amyloid antibody under our arrangement with Neurimmune Therapeutics AG. We also received $75.0 million pursuant to our Elan collaboration. All of these milestone payments are included in cash from operations except the conforma payment which is included in investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, foreign and U.S. government instruments, and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. The value of these securities may be adversely affected which could impact our financial position and our overall liquidity. In particular, the value of our investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio, declines in the value of collateral underlying the mortgage, auto and credit card asset backed securities included in our portfolio, and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in value of the investments. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost. We attempt to mitigate these risks with the assistance of our investment advisors by investing in high quality securities and continuously monitoring the overall risk profile of our portfolio. We also maintain a well diversified portfolio that limits our credit exposure through concentration limits set within our investment policy. As noted in Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, a majority of our financial assets and liabilities have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services. The pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates, other industry, and economic events. We validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources, and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. The fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, debt instruments and plan assets for deferred compensation are based on market inputs and have been classified as Level 2. While we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate, the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on the values of these assets, our financial position, and overall liquidity. Refer to Item 7A of this Form 10 K, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk, for further discussion of the impact of changes in interest rates on these investments. 55 Table of Contents We have financed our operating and capital expenditures through cash flows from our operations. We financed our common stock tender offer in July 2007 through the use of debt and existing cash. We expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash from operations, as well as existing cash resources. We believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we may, from time to time, seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances, additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. On December 4, 2008, Standard Poors upgraded our credit rating from BBB to BBB+. According to public records, the rating action reflects the prospects for continued growth of our multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise and our conservative financial policies. Specifically, Standard Poors stated that our liquidity is more than adequate and that no significant debt is maturing in the near term, which for us is 2013. We have sufficient liquid funds in cash and marketable securities and have access to a $360.0 million credit facility. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10 K for risk factors that could negatively impact our cash position and ability to fund future operations. Operating activities Cash provided by operations is primarily driven by our net income and adjusted for non cash items. On an ongoing basis, we expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,566.5 million, $1,020.6 million, and $841.3 million, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities for 2008 as compared to 2007, was primarily due to higher earnings net of a higher investment in working capital and the proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher earnings. Movements in working capital accounts, which were a use of funds of $77.9 million in 2007 as compared to a use of funds of $103.3 million in 2006, also contributed to this increase. Investing activities In 2008, 2007, and 2006, net cash used in investing activities was $365.9 million, $286.6 million, and $599.8 million, respectively. In 2008, our sources of cash from investing activities consisted primarily of the net proceeds from sales and purchases of marketable securities. Our primary use of cash in investing activities consisted primarily of the purchases of property plant and equipment of $275.9 million. Payments pursuant to acquisitions and licenses were $25.0 million, which related to our 2006 acquisition of Conforma. The change in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a source of cash in investing activities offset by a use of cash from financing activities. In 2007, net proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $209.0 million, were used to partially fund the tender offer described in Note 21, Tender Offer. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $284.1 million in 2007. Payments made for acquisitions were $95.8 million in 2007, which primarily related to our acquisition of Syntonix for $42.3 million, and our collaboration payments to Cardiokine Biopharma LLC for $50.0 million and Neurimmune of $2.0 million. The change in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing activities. Additionally, in 2007 we sold our position in a strategic investment for $99.5 million. In 2006, net cash used to purchase marketable securities was $162.8 million. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $198.3 million for 2006. Payments made for acquisitions were $363.3 million in 2006, which related to our acquisitions of Fumapharm and Conforma. Proceeds from the sale of product lines were $59.8 million in 2006, which related to the sale of AMEVIVE. 56 Table of Contents Financing activities In 2008, 2007, and 2006, net cash used in financing activities was $1,236.7 million, $735.2 million, and $148.4 million, respectively. The primary increase in use of cash in 2008 was the repayment of our term loan facility of $1,500.0 million, and the purchase of our common stock of $738.9 million, offset in part by the issuance of long term debt, net, of $987.0 million, and proceeds of $178.5 million relating to the exercise of stock options and purchases of our stock under our share based compensation arrangements. In 2007, the primary use of cash related to the repurchase of treasury stock via the tender offer of $2,990.5 million. This repurchase was partially funded with cash proceeds from a short term note of $1,500.0 million. This transaction is described in Note 21, Tender Offer. Additionally, cash proceeds from issuance of stock for our share based compensation arrangements were $489.2 million, which was primarily attributable to the exercise of stock options and participation in our ESPP plan. The change in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing activities. In 2006, the primary use of cash was $320.3 million for the purchase of treasury stock, offset by $147.0 million in proceeds from issuance of stock for our share based compensation arrangements. Borrowings On March 4, 2008, we issued $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due March 1, 2013 and $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due March 1, 2018 for proceeds of $987.0 million, net of issuance costs. Additionally, in connection with the note issuance, we entered into interest rate swaps, which were terminated in December 2008 and are further described in Note 4, Financial Instruments. We used the proceeds of this offering, along with cash and the proceeds from the liquidation of marketable securities, to repay the $1,500.0 million term loan facility we had entered into in July 2007 in connection with the funding of our June 2007 tender offer. In June 2007, we also entered into a five year $400.0 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we may use for working capital and general corporate purposes. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008 has eliminated their $40.0 million commitment, thereby reducing the availability of the credit facility to $360.0 million. The terms of this revolving credit facility include various covenants, including financial covenants that require us to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and under certain circumstance, an interest coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with these covenants and there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Tender Offer On June 27, 2007, pursuant to the terms of a modified Dutch Auction tender offer, we accepted for payment 56,424,155 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.00 per share for a purchase price of $2,990.5 million. We funded the tender offer through existing cash and cash equivalents of $1,490.5 million and a $1,500.0 million term loan facility as described in Note 8, Indebtedness. All of the shares repurchased were retired in July 2007. Commitments As of December 31, 2008, we have completed the first phase of construction of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerd, Denmark, which included partial completion of a bulk manufacturing component, a labeling and packaging component, and installation of major equipment. We are proceeding with the second phase of the project, including the completion of the large scale bulk manufacturing component and construction of a warehouse. As of December 31, 2008, we had contractual commitments of approximately $14.5 million for the second phase. This second phase of the project is expected to be ready for commercial production in 2010. 57 Table of Contents The timing of the completion and anticipated licensing of the bulk manufacturing facility is in part dependent upon market acceptance of TYSABRI. See Risk Factors Our near term success depends on the market acceptance and successful sales growth of TYSABRI. We continue to evaluate our requirements for TYSABRI inventory and additional manufacturing capacity in light of the approved label and our judgment of the potential market acceptance of TYSABRI in MS, and additional approved indications in the U.S., EU and other jurisdictions. Share Repurchase Programs In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock that expired October 4, 2006, under this program we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of $320.3 million in 2006. In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 20.0 million shares of our common stock. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. We have repurchased approximately 12.8 million shares of our common stock for $738.9 million under the share repurchase program as of December 31, 2008. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million additional shares under this program at a total cost of $57.6 million and have approximately 6.0 million shares remaining for repurchase available under this program. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2008, we have funding commitments of up to approximately $25.5 million as part of our investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds. In addition, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $1,237.7 million as part of our various collaborations including licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of December 31, 2008, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. We expect to make approximately $29.0 million of milestone payments in 2009. At December 31, 2008, we have several clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations, or CROs. The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We have recorded accrued expenses of $25.4 million recorded in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet for work done by CROs at December 31, 2008. We have approximately $221.7 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts at December 31, 2008. We do not have any significant relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We consolidate entities within the scope of FIN 46(R) if we are the primary beneficiary. The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding funding and contingent milestone payments as described above and construction commitments disclosed above under Commitments) at December 31, 2008, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 4 5 After Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Non cancellable operating leases $ 399.2 $ 31.4 $ 67.2 $ 54.0 $ 246.6 Notes payable, including interest 1,515.0 92.9 142.6 562.0 717.5 Other long term obligations 24.1 9.8 8.9 5.4 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,938.3 $ 134.1 $ 218.7 $ 616.0 $ 969.5 This table includes our obligation of approximately $12.8 million pursuant to a dedicated resource agreement whereby a laboratory will provide us with dedicated services through 2010. This table excludes any liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. In connection with the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, or FIN 48, we reclassified 58 Table of Contents approximately $113.0 million in reserves for uncertain tax positions from current taxes payable to long term liabilities. At December 31, 2008, we have approximately $145.2 million of long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. Legal Matters See Note 19, Litigation, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of legal matters as of December 31, 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its critical estimates and judgments, including, among others, those related to revenue recognition, investments, inventory, research and development expenses, purchase accounting, goodwill impairment, stock based compensation, and income taxes. Those critical estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Product Revenues We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, VA rebates, managed care rebates, product returns and other applicable allowances. Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. These estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments that we make with regard to revenue recognition. Royalties We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which we have rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees. 59 Table of Contents Investments We invest in various types of securities, including: short term and long term marketable securities, principally corporate notes, government securities and other asset backed securities, in which our excess cash balances are invested. Restrictions that limit the amount of investment exposure by institution, maturity and type are detailed in our Investment Policy. The objectives of this policy are safety of principal, liquidity and lastly yield. equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies some of which we have collaborative agreements with; and equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available. These investments are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, or SFAS 115, or APB No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common, or APB 18, as appropriate. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurement, or SFAS 157, we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability. As noted in Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, a majority of our financial assets and liabilities have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services. The pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates, other industry, and economic events. We validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources, and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. We also have some investments classified as Level 3 whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing and or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies. We apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties. While we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate, the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations. Impairment In accounting for investments, we evaluate if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is other than temporary, and if so, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income. The factors that we consider in our assessments for our investments in debt securities include the fair market value of the security, the duration of the securitys decline, and our ability and intent to hold to maturity. For our investments in equity securities, we consider the fair market value of the security, the duration of the securitys decline as well as prospects for the investee, including favorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements and our intent and ability to hold to recovery. The determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on our financial results. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in, first out, or FIFO, method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. 60 Table of Contents Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements A Replacement of FASB Concepts No. 3, or FASB Concepts Statement No. 6. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval, including safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization. We are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. There is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods. We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs will be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included in costs of goods sold are write downs of commercial inventory that do not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to expiration. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, contract services and other outside expenses. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. The timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense. Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of site management, monitoring costs, and project management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known. Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and In process Research and Development Expenses We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets primarily through the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, an independent third party valuation firm is generally engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting regulatory approvals; 61 Table of Contents estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. FIN 46(R) Under FIN 46(R), we consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, we consider a number of factors, including determining the expected losses and residual returns of the technologies being developed pursuant to collaborations and other economic risk and reward of such collaborations. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these analyses and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: assuming that the research and development efforts will result in an approved commercial product; estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting timing of regulatory approvals; estimating future cash inflows from product sales or funding from partners resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. For such consolidated entities that we own less than a 100% interest, we record minority interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the outside equity interests. FIN 46(R) impacts the way we account for certain collaborations and future events may result in our consolidation of companies or related entities with which we have a collaborative arrangement. The consolidation of variable interest entities may have a material effect on our financial condition and or results of operation in future periods. Goodwill We annually assess our goodwill balance to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. To do this, in the case of goodwill we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets. Calculating fair value involves identifying future cash flows, which requires that we make a number of critical legal, economic, market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date. We believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Notwithstanding this, our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results, or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment. Share based Compensation We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation. In connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, we use the Black Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions. The key assumptions we make are: the expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the award; and the expected forfeiture rate. In connection with our restricted stock programs, we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments. 62 Table of Contents Income Taxes In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of viable tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 48 Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we recognized a reduction in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $14.2 million, which was recorded as a $1.8 million reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of our accumulated deficit, a $9.1 million reduction in goodwill and a $3.3 million increase in our deferred tax liability. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 Balance at January 1 $ 221.1 $ 196.8 Additions based on tax positions related to the current period 21.8 29.7 Additions for tax positions of prior periods 20.4 83.5 Reductions for tax positions of prior periods (13.7 ) (70.2 ) Settlements (18.7 ) Balance at December 31 $ 249.6 $ 221.1 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007, and January 1, 2007, are $155.1 million, $110.5 million, and $98.2 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues), respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods. We do not anticipate any significant changes in our positions in the next twelve months. New Accounting Standards See Note 27, New Accounting Pronouncements, for a discussion of new accounting standards. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have operations in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, India and throughout Europe in connection with the sale of AVONEX, TYSABRI and FUMADERM. We also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through Genentech on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Euro, Danish kroner, Swedish krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc). 63 Table of Contents We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation. We use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities (for example, a strengthening of the Euro) would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately $52.4 million. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account operating transactions. Certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is, therefore, subject to changes in market interest rates. A 100 basis point adverse movement (increase in LIBOR) would increase annual interest expense by approximately $0.2 million. In addition, the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. We estimate that such hypothetical adverse 100 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $12.2 million to our interest rate sensitive instruments. The returns from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change. A 100 basis point adverse movement (decrease) in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $11.9 million. We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. We regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $0.9 million.
