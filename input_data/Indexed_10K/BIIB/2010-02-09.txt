Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page F 1 of this report. Executive Summary Introduction Biogen Idec is a global biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas with high unmet medical needs. Our business strategy is focused on discovering and developing first in class or best in class products that we can deliver to specialty markets globally. Patients around the world benefit from Biogen Idecs significant products that address medical needs in the areas of neurology, oncology and immunology. In the near term, we are dependent on continued sales of AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI to drive our revenue growth. In the longer term, our revenue growth is also dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels. We continue to focus our research and development efforts within our core and emergent areas of neurology, oncology, immunology, cardiopulmonary and hemophilia. 34 Table of Contents Financial Highlights The following table is a summary of financial results achieved: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 December 31, Compared (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) 2009 2008 to 2008 Total revenues $ 4,377.3 $ 4,097.5 6.8 % Income from operations $ 1,295.4 $ 1,213.6 6.7 % Net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. $ 970.1 $ 783.2 23.9 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. $ 3.35 $ 2.65 26.4 % As described below under Results of Operations, our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009, were primarily driven by: Increased AVONEX worldwide revenue. Total AVONEX revenues were $2,322.9 million in 2009, representing a 5.5% increase over 2008. Continued TYSABRI growth. Global in market net sales of TYSABRI totaled $1,059.2 million in 2009. Our share of TYSABRI revenues totaled $776.0 million in 2009, representing an increase of 31.8% over 2008. U.S. in market net sales of RITUXAN totaled $2,665.5 million in 2009, representing an increase of 3.0% over 2008. Our share of RITUXAN revenues totaled $1,094.9 million in 2009, which is inclusive of our share of co promotion profits in the U.S. totaling $773.6 million, representing an increase of 5.5% over 2008. This increase was offset by a $79.3 million decrease in our share of revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world. Total costs and expenses increased 6.9% as compared to 2008. This increase was driven by a 19.7% increase in research and development spending and a 58.8% increase in collaboration profit sharing expense due to TYSABRI growth. These increases were offset by a 5.0% decrease in costs of sales, a reduction in selling, general and administrative expense of 1.5%, and a decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets of 12.9%. In addition to the strong operating results achieved, we generated $1,074.9 million of net cash flows from operations during 2009, which were primarily driven by increases in our earnings. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2,457.8 million as of December 31, 2009. Business Highlights In October 2009, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, with repurchased shares being retired. During 2009, approximately 16.0 million shares at a cost of $751.2 million were repurchased under this and our 2006 share repurchase programs. In June 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Acorda) to develop and commercialize products containing fampridine in markets outside the U.S. In July 2009, we made a $110.0 million upfront payment pursuant to this agreement. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues Revenues are summarized as follows: % Change 2009 2008 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Product: United States $ 1,638.0 $ 1,472.9 $ 1,203.6 11.2 % 22.4 % Rest of world 1,514.9 1,366.8 933.2 10.8 % 46.5 % Total product revenues 3,152.9 2,839.7 2,136.8 11.0 % 32.9 % Unconsolidated joint business 1,094.9 1,128.2 926.1 (3.0 )% 21.8 % Other 129.5 129.6 108.7 (0.1 )% 19.2 % Total revenues $ 4,377.3 $ 4,097.5 $ 3,171.6 6.8 % 29.2 % Product Revenues Product revenues are summarized as follows: % Change 2009 2008 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 AVONEX $ 2,322.9 $ 2,202.6 $ 1,867.8 5.5 % 17.9 % TYSABRI 776.0 588.6 229.9 31.8 % 156.0 % Other 54.0 48.5 39.1 11.3 % 24.0 % Total product revenues $ 3,152.9 $ 2,839.7 $ 2,136.8 11.0 % 32.9 % AVONEX Revenues from AVONEX are summarized as follows: % Change 2009 2008 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 United States $ 1,406.2 $ 1,276.5 $ 1,085.0 10.2 % 17.6 % Rest of world 916.7 926.1 782.8 (1.0 )% 18.3 % Total AVONEX revenues $ 2,322.9 $ 2,202.6 $ 1,867.8 5.5 % 17.9 % For 2009 compared to 2008, as well as for 2008 compared to 2007, the increase in U.S. AVONEX revenue was due to price increases, offset by decreased patient demand. Decreased commercial demand resulted in a 7.6% and a 6.0% decline in U.S. AVONEX sales volume in 2009 and 2008, respectively, over their prior year comparative periods. In addition, during 2009, we experienced higher participation in our Access Program, which provides free product to eligible patients. For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in rest of world AVONEX revenue was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against relevant foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, offset by increased patient demand and price increases in some countries. For 2008 compared to 2007, rest of world sales of AVONEX increased due to increased patient demand, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes and the establishment of additional direct market affiliates. Increased commercial demand 36 Table of Contents resulted in increases of 6.3% and 8.6% in rest of world AVONEX sales volume in 2009 and 2008, respectively, over their prior year comparative periods. AVONEX rest of world revenues for 2009, 2008 and 2007 also include losses of $39.5 million, $8.5 million and $13.1 million, respectively, recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments. Continued growth of AVONEX revenue is primarily dependent on maintaining AVONEXs position as one of the most prescribed MS therapies in the world. We expect to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace in both the U.S. and rest of world from existing and new MS treatments, including oral and other alternative formulations developed by our competitors, the continued growth of TYSABRI and the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates, which may have a continued negative impact on the unit sales of AVONEX as well as increasing price pressure. We continue to generate data showing AVONEX to be an effective and safe choice for MS patients and physicians. TYSABRI We collaborate with Elan Pharma International, Ltd (Elan) an affiliate of Elan Corporation, plc, on the development and commercialization of TYSABRI. Please read Note 17, Collaborations to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of this collaboration. In the U.S., we sell TYSABRI to Elan who sells the product to third party distributors. Our sales price to Elan in the U.S. is set prior to the beginning of each quarterly period to effect an approximate equal sharing of the gross margin on sales in the U.S. between Elan and us. We recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. upon Elans shipment of the product to the third party distributors. In the rest of world markets, we are responsible for distributing TYSABRI to customers and are primarily responsible for all operating activities. We recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI in the rest of world at the time of product delivery to our customers. Revenues from TYSABRI include (1) our share of net U.S. sales of TYSABRI from Elan to third party customers; (2) revenue on sales of TYSABRI in rest of world markets; (3) amortization of deferred revenue amounts related to Elan milestone payments made to us; and (4) gains or losses recognized in relation to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted revenues. Revenues from TYSABRI are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 United States $ 231.8 $ 196.4 $ 104.4 18.0 % 88.1 % Rest of world 544.2 392.2 125.5 38.8 % 212.5 % Total TYSABRI revenues $ 776.0 $ 588.6 $ 229.9 31.8 % 156.0 % For 2009 compared to 2008, as well as for 2008 compared to 2007, the increase in U.S. TYSABRI revenue was due to the continued increase in the number of patients using TYSABRI in the U.S. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of 16.3% and 88.7% in U.S. TYSABRI sales volume for 2009 and 2008, respectively, over their prior year comparative periods. Net sales of TYSABRI from our collaboration partner, Elan, to third party customers in the U.S. for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $508.5 million, $421.6 million and $217.4 million, respectively. For 2009 compared to 2008, as well as for 2008 compared to 2007, the increase in rest of world TYSABRI revenue was due to the continued increase in the number of patients using TYSABRI in our rest of world markets. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of 49.0% and 203.8% in U.S. TYSABRI sales volume for 2009 and 2008, respectively, over their prior year comparative periods. The increase in TYSABRI revenues in 2009 was offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. 37 Table of Contents TYSABRI rest of world revenues for 2009 also include losses of $10.1 million recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments; no such losses were recognized in 2008 or 2007 as we did not designate hedges against TYSABRI rest of world revenues in those periods. In 2009 and 2008, we recognized $7.1 million and $1.5 million respectively of product revenue related to the amortization of the Elan milestone payments. Since we reintroduced TYSABRI to the market in July 2006, some patients taking TYSABRI have been diagnosed with PML, a rare but serious brain infection described in the TYSABRI label. In November 2009, the U.S. prescribing information for TYSABRI was revised to reflect that the risk of PML increases with longer treatment duration, and for patients treated for 24 to 36 months is generally similar to the rates seen in clinical trials. The revised label also reflects that there is limited experience beyond three years of treatment. In January 2010, the EMA recommended updating the TYSABRI label in the E.U. to reflect that the risk of PML increases after two years of therapy. The EMA also recommended that patients have regular MRI scans and be reinformed of the risk of PML after two years of therapy. We continue to monitor the growth of TYSABRI unit sales, which may be further impacted by the updated prescribing information. We continue to research and develop protocols that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of PML in patients being treated with TYSABRI. We are working to identify patient or viral characteristics which contribute to the risk of developing PML, including the presence of asymptomatic JC virus infection with a serological assay for antibodies against the JC virus. Our efforts to improve management by physicians of PML and to improve patient outcomes have included researching plasma exchange to more rapidly remove TYSABRI from a patient, and drug screening that identified mefloquine as an anti JC virus drug candidate. Other Product Revenues Other product revenues represent revenues derived from FUMADERM, ZEVALIN and AMEVIVE and are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 FUMADERM $ 49.6 $ 43.4 $ 21.5 14.3 % 101.9 % ZEVALIN $ 4.4 $ 4.8 $ 16.9 (8.3 )% (71.6 )% AMEVIVE $ $ 0.3 $ 0.7 (100.0 )% (57.1 )% Total other product revenues $ 54.0 $ 48.5 $ 39.1 11.3 % 24.0 % Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenues We collaborate with Genentech on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN. Please read Note 17, Collaborations to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of this collaboration. The majority of RITUXAN unit sales are for use in oncology as a treatment for certain types of B cell NHL. We believe there is opportunity for RITUXAN unit sales growth in the immunology setting, where RITUXAN is used as a treatment for certain types of RA. Additional immunology indications for RITUXAN that we are investigating include ANCA associated vasculitis. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of (1) our share of pretax co promotion profits in the U.S.; (2) reimbursement of our selling and development expense in the U.S.; and (3) revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world, which consist of our share of pretax co promotion profits in Canada and royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and Canada by F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd. (Roche) and its sublicensees. Pre tax co promotion profits are calculated and paid to us by Genentech in the U.S. and by Roche in Canada. Pre tax co promotion profits consist of U.S. and Canadian sales of RITUXAN to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing, and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech, Roche and us. 38 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of revenues from unconsolidated joint business: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Biogen Idecs share of co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 773.6 $ 733.5 $ 616.8 5.5 % 18.9 % Reimbursement of selling and development expenses in the U.S. 65.6 59.7 58.5 9.9 % 2.1 % Revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world 255.7 335.0 250.8 (23.7 )% 33.6 % Total unconsolidated joint business revenues $ 1,094.9 $ 1,128.2 $ 926.1 (3.0 )% 21.8 % Biogen Idecs Share of Co Promotion Profits in the U.S. The following table provides a summary of amounts comprising our share of co promotion profits in the U.S.: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Product revenues, net $ 2,665.5 $ 2,587.4 $ 2,284.8 3.0 % 13.2 % Costs and expenses 724.1 741.0 730.2 (2.3 )% 1.5 % Co promotion profits in the United States $ 1,941.4 $ 1,846.4 $ 1,554.6 5.1 % 18.8 % Biogen Idec Inc.s share of co promotion profits in the United States $ 773.6 $ 733.5 $ 616.8 5.5 % 18.9 % For 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in U.S. RITUXAN product revenue on sales recorded by Genentech resulted from continued growth for treatment of B cell NHL and RA, and price increases. For 2008 compared to 2007 the increase in U.S. RITUXAN product revenue was primarily due to increased unit sales in treatments of B cell NHL, CLL (an unapproved and unpromoted use of RITUXAN) and RA, and price increases. Collaboration costs and expenses for 2009 as compared to 2008 decreased primarily due to higher costs incurred in development of RITUXAN for use in other indications during 2008. Under our collaboration agreement, our current pretax co promotion profit sharing formula, which resets annually, provides for a 30% share of co promotion profits on the first $50.0 million of co promotion operating profit with our share increasing to 40% if co promotion operating profits exceed $50.0 million. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, the 40% threshold was met during the first quarter. In addition, under our collaboration agreement, we have rights to collaborate with Genentech on the development and commercialization of (1) anti CD20 products that Genentech acquires or develops, which we refer to as New Anti CD20 Products, and (2) anti CD20 products that Genentech licenses from a third party, which we refer to as Third Party Anti CD20 Products. Our collaboration rights for New Anti CD20 Products are limited to the U.S. and our collaboration rights for Third Party Anti CD20 Products are dependent upon Genentechs underlying license rights. There is only one New Anti CD20 Product, ocrelizumab, and only one Third Party Anti CD20 Product, GA101. Our agreement with Genentech also provides that the successful development and commercialization of the first New Anti CD20 Product will decrease our percentage of co promotion profits of the collaboration. Please read Note 17, Collaborations to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the pretax co promotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and New Anti CD20 Products sold by us and Genentech following the approval date of the first New Anti CD20 Product. We will participate in Third Party Anti CD20 Products on similar financial terms as for ocrelizumab. 39 Table of Contents Reimbursement of Selling and Development Expense in the U.S. As discussed within Note 17, Collaborations to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Genentech incurs the majority of continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Expenses incurred by Genentech in the development of RITUXAN are not recorded as research and development expense, but rather reduce our share of co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue. Selling and development expenses, incurred by us in the U.S. and reimbursed by Genentech, increased in 2009 as compared 2008 due to an increase in sales and marketing expense associated with CLL and legal fees. The increase in selling and development expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to development costs we incurred related to the development of RITUXAN in RA. Revenue on Sales of RITUXAN in the Rest of World We record our royalty revenue and co promotion profit revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world on a cash basis. Revenues on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to royalty expirations in certain of these markets and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Revenues on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to several factors, including increased market penetration in NHL and increased use in RA. The royalty period for sales in the rest of world with respect to all products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis. For the majority of European countries, the first commercial sale of RITUXAN occurred in the second half of 1998. Specifically, the royalty periods with respect to sales in France, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom expired in 2009. The royalty period with respect to sales in Italy will expire in 2010. The royalty periods with respect to sales in other countries will subsequently expire through 2012. As a result of these expirations, we expect royalty revenues derived from sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world to continue to decline in future years. Other Revenues Our product line previously included ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan) which is part of a treatment regimen for certain B cell NHL, and AMEVIVE (alefacept), a treatment for certain moderate to severe psoriasis. We have sold or exclusively licensed the rights to these products to third parties and continue to receive supply agreement revenues based on those products which are included in corporate partner revenues. We also receive royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of other products under patents that we own. Other revenues are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Royalty revenues $ 124.4 $ 116.2 $ 102.1 7.1 % 13.8 % Corporate partner revenues 5.1 13.4 6.6 (61.9 )% 103.0 % Other revenues $ 129.5 $ 129.6 $ 108.7 (0.1 )% 19.2 % Royalty Revenues We receive royalties on sales by our licensees of products covered under patents that we own. Sales of licensed products could vary significantly due to competition, manufacturing difficulties and other factors that are not within our control. In addition, the expiration or invalidation of any underlying patents could reduce or eliminate the royalty revenues derived from such patents. The increase in royalty revenues in 2009 as compared to 2008, as well as in 2008 as compared to 2007, was primarily due to increased sales of ANGIOMAX (bivalirudin) licensed to The Medicines Company (TMC) offset by a decline in royalties from sales of other licensed product and the expiration of certain contracts and license agreements. 40 Table of Contents Our most significant source of royalty revenue is derived from sales of ANGIOMAX by TMC. TMC sells ANGIOMAX in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Latin America for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Royalty revenues related to the sales of ANGIOMAX are recognized in an amount equal to the level of net sales achieved during a calendar year multiplied by the royalty rate in effect for that tier under our agreement with TMC. The royalty rate increases based upon which tier of total net sales are earned in any calendar year. The increased royalty rate is applied retroactively to the first dollar of net sales achieved during the year. This formula has the effect of increasing the amount of royalty revenue to be recognized in later quarters. Accordingly, an adjustment is recorded in the period in which an increase in royalty rate has been achieved. Under the terms of our agreement, TMC is obligated to pay us royalties earned, on a country by country basis, until the later of (1) twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of ANGIOMAX in such country and (2) the date upon which the product is no longer covered by a patent in such country. The annual royalty rate is reduced by a specified percentage in any country where the product is no longer covered by a patent and where sales have been reduced to a certain volume based market share. TMC began selling ANGIOMAX in the U.S. in January 2001. The principal U.S. patent that covers ANGIOMAX expires in March 2010. The FDA has granted TMC an additional period of marketing exclusivity for ANGIOMAX in order to investigate its use in pediatric patients. This period expires in September 2010. In the event that third parties sell products comparable to ANGIOMAX after the period of marketing exclusivity expires, we would expect a significant decrease in royalty revenues due to lower royalty rates and increased competition. Provisions for Discounts and Allowances Revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration (VA) rebates, managed care rebates, product returns, and other applicable allowances. Reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). For 2009 compared to 2008, as well as 2008 compared to 2007, the increases in total allowances were primarily due to price increases. Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual requirements, statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data, as adjusted, to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product. Reserves for discounts, contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues were as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Discounts $ 74.0 $ 67.1 $ 45.7 10.3 % 46.8 % Contractual adjustments 192.5 149.0 105.2 29.2 % 41.6 % Returns 16.6 12.2 22.1 36.1 % (44.8 )% Total allowances $ 283.1 $ 228.3 $ 173.0 24.0 % 32.0 % Gross product revenues $ 3,436.0 $ 3,068.0 $ 2,309.8 12.0 % 32.8 % Percent of gross product revenues 8.2 % 7.4 % 7.5 % 10.8 % (1.3 )% 41 Table of Contents Discount reserves include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives. For 2009 compared to 2008, as well as for 2008 compared to 2007, the increase in discounts was primarily driven by increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives as a result of price increases. Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid, VA and managed care rebates and other applicable allowances. For 2009 compared to 2008, as well as for 2008 compared to 2007, contractual adjustments increased primarily due to the impact of higher reserves for managed care (associated with higher level of activity with respect to rebates and price increases in the U.S.) and Medicaid and VA programs (associated with price increases in the U.S.). Product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from our patients for various reasons. For 2009 compared to 2008, return reserves remained relatively unchanged. For 2008 compared to 2007, return reserves decreased primarily due to a decrease in estimated product returns based on historical trends. Costs and Expenses A summary of total costs and expenses is as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 382.1 $ 402.0 $ 335.2 (5.0 )% 19.9 % Research and development 1,283.1 1,072.1 925.2 19.7 % 15.9 % Selling, general and administrative 911.0 925.3 776.1 (1.5 )% 19.2 % Collaboration profit sharing 215.9 136.0 14.0 58.8 % 871.4 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 289.8 332.7 257.5 (12.9 )% 29.2 % Acquired in process research and development 25.0 84.2 (100.0 )% (70.3 )% Facility impairments and (gain) loss on disposition, net (9.2 ) (0.4 ) (100.0 )% 2200.0 % Costs and expenses $ 3,081.9 $ 2,883.9 $ 2,391.8 6.9 % 20.6 % Cost of Sales, Excluding Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets (Cost of Sales) Components of cost of sales are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Cost of product revenues $ 378.1 $ 397.0 $ 330.5 (4.8 )% 20.1 % Cost of royalty revenues 4.0 5.0 4.7 (20.0 )% 6.4 % Cost of sales $ 382.1 $ 402.0 $ 335.2 (5.0 )% 19.9 % For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decrease in write downs from unmarketable inventory of $12.9 million, decreased production costs of approximately $10.9 million resulting from the implementation of a new high titer production process which produces higher yields of TYSABRI and an $8.8 million decrease in royalty payments on sales of licensed product due mainly to the expiration of certain contracts and license agreements. These decreases were offset by a $17.0 million increase in costs associated with higher TYSABRI sales volume. In addition, during 2008 we also incurred a $4.3 million period expense related to the shutdown of our manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina for the implementation of the high titer production process upgrades. 42 Table of Contents For 2008 as compared to 2007, the overall increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher sales volume offset by decreased write downs from unmarketable inventory. Write downs from Unmarketable Inventory Our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. The shelf life associated with our products is generally between 3 and 48 months, depending on the product. Obsolescence due to expiration has historically been insignificant. Amounts written down related to unmarketable inventory are charged to cost of sales, and totaled $16.9 million, $29.8 million and $21.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Research and Development % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Research and development $ 1,283.1 $ 1,072.1 $ 925.2 19.7 % 15.9 % We devote significant resources to research and development programs focusing our efforts on finding novel therapeutics in areas of high unmet medical need within our core and emergent focus areas of neurology, oncology, immunology, cardiopulmonary and hemophilia. Over the past few years, we have incurred significant expenditures related to the development of new product candidates and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders in addition to those currently approved in their labels. Costs associated with later stage clinical trials are, in most cases, more significant than those incurred in earlier stages of our pipeline. Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including compensation and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, fees paid to clinical research organizations (CROs) and other outside expenses. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. The timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense. For 2009 compared to 2008, research and development expenses increased by $211.0 million, driven primarily by the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda, as well as a net increase of $100.2 million related to the ramp up of clinical trial activity for certain development stage product candidates including lixivaptan, BG 12, humanized anti CD20 and ADENTRI. In addition, in 2009, we initiated registrational trials in our PEGylated interferon program. The aforementioned increases were offset by a reduction of spending across several programs including baminercept in RA, lumiliximab and volociximab. For 2008 compared to 2007, research and development expenses increased by $146.9 million, driven by an increase of $56.4 million related to the continued advancement of our pipeline into Phase 3 clinical trials. In 2008, we initiated a registrational trial in our lixivaptan program, a Phase 2 trial in our ADENTRI program, and continued to develop our BG 12, anti CD80 MAb (galiximab) and anti CD23 MAb (lumiliximab) programs. In 2008, we had 8 programs in Phase 3 clinical trials as compared to 5 in 2007. We also increased spending in our anti CD20 programs in both Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials by $46.2 million primarily due to a $31.5 million opt in payment to participate in the Roche led GA101 program. The balance of the increase of $44.3 million was due to other research and development investments, primarily in our pre clinical and early stage pipeline programs including HSP90, BIIB014, BART and LINGO programs. We expect total research and development expense in 2010 to be between 24% and 27% of total revenue. 43 Table of Contents Milestone and Upfront Payments Milestone and upfront payments made to our collaboration partners and included within research and development expense are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Total milestone and upfront payments reflected within research and development expense $ 151.5 $ 47.6 $ 52.0 218.3 % (8.5 )% For 2009 as compared to 2008, the increase in milestone and upfront payments was primarily the result of the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda. Selling, General and Administrative % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Selling, general and administrative $ 911.0 $ 925.3 $ 776.1 (1.5 )% 19.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel, outside marketing and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and a reduction of expenses reimbursed to Elan for their marketing of TYSABRI for Crohns disease in the U.S. These decreases were offset by costs incurred associated with our geographic expansion into new markets. For 2008 compared to 2007, selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a $90.0 million increase in sales and marketing, of which $55.3 million related to international sales and marketing activities primarily for AVONEX and TYSABRI and $43.6 million related to an increase in compensation and benefits for general and administrative personnel as well as increases in fees and services. We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in 2010 as compared to the total amount incurred in 2009 primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities in support of AVONEX and TYSABRI. In addition, under the transition agreement entered into with James C. Mullen, we will incur approximately $21 million of expense in the first half of 2010 all of which relates to the modification of his existing equity based compensation awards. The substantial portion of this charge is due to the incremental value attributable to the extension of Mr. Mullens stock option awards. Collaboration Profit Sharing % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Collaboration profit sharing $ 215.9 $ 136.0 $ 14.1 58.7 % 866.3 % Payments are made to Elan for their share of the rest of world net operating profits to effect an equal sharing of collaboration operating profit. These payments include the reimbursement of our portion of third party royalties that Elan pays on behalf of the collaboration, relating to sales in the rest of world. These amounts are reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line in our consolidated statements of income. Our collaboration profit sharing expense increases as rest of world sales of TYSABRI increase and is impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For 2009 as compared to 2008, as well as for 2008 as compared to 2007, the increases were due to the continued increase in TYSABRI rest of world sales resulting in a higher rest of world net operating profits to be shared with Elan and causing growth in the third party royalties Elan paid on behalf of the collaboration. 44 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our collaboration profit sharing expense included $40.0 million, $28.4 million and $9.1 million, respectively, related to the reimbursement of Elans royalty payments. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 289.8 $ 332.7 $ 257.5 (12.9 )% 29.2 % Our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our AVONEX product. Our amortization policy reflects our belief that the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our AVONEX product. We refer to this amortization methodology as the economic consumption model, which involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of AVONEX is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle, and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model. Although we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset, the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances, due to continued sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise. In order to ensure that amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods, we compare the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model against the minimum amount of amortization recalculated each year under the straight line method. Amortization is then recorded based upon the higher of the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model or the minimum amortization amount determined under the straight line method. We completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of 2009. This analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis, such as the anticipated product sales of AVONEX and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates, as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents. Based on this analysis, we have continued to amortize this asset on the economic consumption model for the third and fourth quarters of 2009, and expect to apply the same model for the first two quarters in 2010. The results of our analysis were most significantly impacted by the issuance in September 2009 of a U.S. patent covering the treatment of MS with AVONEX, which resulted in an increase in the total expected lifetime revenue of AVONEX and an extension of the assumed remaining life of our core intangible asset. As a result of these changes in the total expected lifetime revenues of AVONEX, amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 decreased significantly over their respective prior year comparative periods. Based upon this most recent analysis, amortization of intangible assets, included within our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, is expected to be in the range of approximately $160.0 million to $220.0 million for each of the next five years. For 2008 compared to 2007, the increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the changes in the estimate of the future total expected lifetime revenues of AVONEX that occurred as part of the annual reassessment of amortization expense in the third quarters of 2008 and 2007. The change in the estimate of the future revenue of AVONEX was attributable to the expected impact of competitor products, including the commercialization of our own pipeline product candidates. Acquired In Process Research and Development (IPRD) % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Acquired in process research and development $ $ 25.0 $ 84.2 (100.0 )% (70.3 )% Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations, which changes the accounting treatment of acquired IPRD. For acquisitions occurring prior to January 1, 2009, we measured 45 Table of Contents acquired IPRD at fair value and expensed it on the acquisition date, or capitalized it as intangible assets if certain criteria were met. However, effective January 1, 2009, acquired IPRD will be measured at fair value and capitalized as intangible assets and amortized from the date of completion over its estimated useful life. In addition, the acquired IPRD will be tested for impairment until completion of the acquired programs. In 2008, we recorded an IPRD charge of $25.0 million related to a HSP90 related milestone payment made to the former shareholders of Conforma Therapeutics, Inc. (Conforma) pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of Conforma in 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded IPRD charges of $84.2 million. The principal components of this amount are as follows: $18.4 million related to the acquisition of Syntonix Pharmaceuticals (Syntonix); $30.0 million related to the collaboration with Cardiokine Biopharma LLC (Cardiokine); and $34.3 million related to the collaboration with Neurimmune SubOne AG (Neurimmune). Cardiokine and Neurimmune are variable interest entities as defined under the guidance set forth within the Consolidation Topic of the Codification. The consolidation of these entities resulted in IPRD charges which have been recorded as a component of operating income. However, because the IPRD charges relate to the fair value of the underlying technology retained by the parent companies of Cardiokine and Neurimmune, these amounts were allocated to the respective noncontrolling interests. We use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair values associated with acquired technologies. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include but are not limited to an estimate of future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed and in process products and the use of discount and probability rates on a project basis. Refer to Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and In process Research and Development Expenses within Critical Accounting Estimates for additional discussion. We believe that the discount rates utilized in our valuations are commensurate with the stage of development of these compounds and uncertainties in the economic estimates associated with each development relationship. The IPRD charge related to our collaboration with Neurimmune was determined based upon an estimate of revenues expected to be recognized beginning in 2018 related to the Beta Amyloid antibody and a discount rate of 15%. The IPRD charge related to our collaboration with Cardiokine was determined assuming a discount rate of 11% and an estimate of revenues expected to be recognized beginning in 2012 for lixivaptan. The amount allocated to IPRD resulting from the acquisition of Syntonix relates to the development of long acting recombinant Factor IX and long acting recombinant Factor VIII assuming estimated revenues expected to be recognized beginning in 2012 and 2013, respectively. A discount rate of 13% was used to value these projects. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Syntonix in January 2007, we agreed to make additional future consideration payments contingent upon the achievement of certain milestone events. In accordance with our acquisition agreement, we will make a $40.0 million milestone payment to the former shareholders of Syntonix during the first quarter of 2010. This amount will be recorded as a charge to IPRD in the first quarter of 2010. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 17, Collaborations to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Other Income (Expense), Net Components of other income (expense), net, are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Interest income $ 48.5 $ 72.1 $ 103.6 (32.7 )% (30.4 )% Interest expense (35.8 ) (52.0 ) (40.5 ) 31.2 % (28.4 )% Impairment on investments (10.6 ) (60.3 ) (24.4 ) 82.4 % (147.1 )% Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net 22.8 (1.1 ) 16.7 2,172.7 % (106.6 )% 46 Table of Contents % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Foreign exchange gains (losses), net 11.4 (9.8 ) 3.0 216.3 % (426.7 )% Gain on the sale of property 7.1 0.0 % (100.0 )% Other, net 1.0 (6.6 ) 6.9 114.9 % (197.1 )% Other income (expense), net $ 37.3 $ (57.7 ) $ 72.4 164.5 % (179.8 )% Interest Income For 2009 as compared to 2008, interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, offset by higher average cash balances. For 2008 compared to 2007, interest income decreased primarily due to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to the funding of our tender offer in July 2007, a net payment of $525.5 million for our term loan facility and lower investment yields. Interest Expense For 2009 as compared to 2008, interest expense decreased primarily due to decreased average debt balances. In addition in 2009, approximately $5.4 million was recorded as a reduction of interest expense due to the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the termination of an interest rate swap in December 2008. This is further described in Note 8, Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2008 compared to 2007, interest expense increased primarily due to an increased average debt balance as well as $8.9 million of expense incurred in 2008 due to the impact of hedge ineffectiveness as discussed in Note 8, Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We capitalized interest costs related to construction in progress totaling approximately $28.5 million, $23.2 million and $10.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which were primarily related to the development of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerd, Denmark, which as a result reduced our interest expense by the same amount. We expect the amount of interest capitalized in relation to this facility will decrease in 2010. Impairment on Investments In April 2009, we implemented newly issued accounting standards which provided guidance for recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations; however, this standard amended the other than temporary impairment model for marketable debt securities. The impairment model for equity securities was not affected. Refer to Note 7, Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the adoption of this guidance. In 2009, we recognized impairment losses of $7.0 million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional $3.6 million in charges for the other than temporary impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage and asset backed securities. In 2008, we recognized impairment losses of $18.6 million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional $41.7 million in impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage, asset backed and corporate securities. In 2007 we recognized impairment losses of $18.4 million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional $7.5 million in impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage and asset backed securities. We may incur additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. 47 Table of Contents Impairment on Property We own or lease real estate primarily consisting of buildings that contain research laboratories, office space, and biologic manufacturing operations, some of which are located in markets that are experiencing high vacancy rates and decreasing property values. If we decide to consolidate, co locate or dispose of certain aspects of our business operations, for strategic or other operational reasons, we may dispose of one or more of our properties. Due to reduced expectations of product demand, improved yields on production and other factors, we may not fully utilize our manufacturing facilities at normal levels resulting in idle time at facilities or substantial excess manufacturing capacity. We are always evaluating our current strategy, as well as other alternatives, including whether to delay completion of the Denmark facility. If any of our owned properties are held for sale, or disposed of, we may not realize the full investment in these properties and incur significant impairment charges if the fair value of the properties were determined to be lower than their book value. In addition, if we decide to fully or partially vacate a leased property, we may incur significant cost, including lease termination fees, rent expense in excess of sublease income and impairment of leasehold improvements. Income Tax Provision Tax Rate % Change For the Years Ended 2009 2008 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Effective tax rate on pre tax income 26.7 % 31.6 % 32.0 % (15.5 )% (1.3 )% Income tax expense $ 355.6 $ 365.8 $ 272.4 (2.8 )% 34.3 % Our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the nature of our global operations. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings between multiple jurisdictions, changes in tax laws, acquisitions and licensing transactions. In 2009, our effective tax rate was impacted by the following significant items: Tax impact from licensing transaction During 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Acorda. As there is no income tax benefit associated with either the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda or our development spending on fampridine outside the U.S., these payments had a 2.1% unfavorable impact on our 2009 effective tax rate. Tax impact from changes in tax laws We established deferred tax assets and adjusted certain deferred tax liabilities, and adjusted our reserves for uncertain tax positions, due to changes in tax laws in certain states in which we operate. This had a favorable effect of 2.3% on our 2009 effective tax rate. Tax impact from resolution of tax audits The resolution of federal, state and foreign tax audits resulted in reducing our reserves for several uncertain tax positions, which had a favorable effect of 2.1% on our 2009 effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in 2009 was lower than in 2008 due to the net effect of the three items noted above and a higher percentage of our foreign earnings being subject to U.S. income taxation in 2008. The effect of the allocation of earnings was partially offset by certain tax credits and deferred tax assets which will be realized as a result of our 2008 domestic reorganization. Our effective tax rate in 2008 was higher than 2007 primarily due to a reorganization of our international operations in 2008 and the allocation of our earnings subject to U.S. taxation in each year. The 2008 domestic and foreign reorganizations to our corporate structure involved the movement of certain personnel, operations and processes among our affiliates. Our effective tax rate will continue to be dependent on the allocation of our profits among jurisdictions and the percentage of our foreign earnings which are subject to taxation in the U.S. We expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be between 28% and 30%. This rate does not consider the impact of a potential renewal of the federal research and development tax credit. 48 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial condition is summarized as follows: % Change 2009 As of December 31, Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 to 2008 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 581.9 $ 622.4 (6.5 )% Marketable and loaned securities current 681.8 749.0 (9.0 )% Marketable securities non current 1,194.1 891.4 34.0 % Total financial assets $ 2,457.8 $ 2,262.8 8.6 % Borrowings: Current portion of notes payable and line of credit $ 19.8 $ 27.7 (28.5 )% Notes payable and line of credit 1,080.2 1085.4 (0.5 )% Total borrowings $ 1,100.0 $ 1,113.1 (1.2 )% Working capital $ 1,765.7 $ 1,534.8 15.0 % For the year end December 31, 2009, certain significant cash flows were as follows: $1,074.9 million of cash flows generated from operations, inclusive of the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda on July 1, 2009; $751.2 million used for share repurchases; $745.4 million in total payments for income taxes; $229.1 million used for net purchases of marketable securities; and $165.6 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Significant cash flow activities during 2008 included the net repayment of approximately $525.5 million of indebtedness, $738.9 million used to fund share repurchases, $222.8 used for the net purchases of marketable securities, and $276.0 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment offset by cash generated from operations of $1,562.4 million. We have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through cash flows from our operations. We expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash from operations, as well as existing cash resources. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of, and access to, financing are adequate to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic alliance and acquisition, milestone payments, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives, including acquisition and licensing activities. We may, from time to time, seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. Please read the Risk Factors and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk sections of this report for items that could negatively impact our cash position and ability to fund future operations. Share Repurchase Programs In October 2009, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, with repurchased shares being retired. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 8.8 million shares at a cost of $422.4 million were repurchased under this program, all of which were retired. From January 1, 2010 through February 5, 2010, we repurchased approximately an additional 5.4 million shares under this program at a total cost of approximately $289.4 million, all of which were also retired. Approximately $288.2 million remains available for the repurchase of our common stock under the 2009 program. The remaining shares that may be purchased under this program is subject to price fluctuations of our common stock. 49 Table of Contents In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. This repurchase program was completed during the fourth quarter of 2009. During 2009, approximately 7.2 million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately $328.8 million under this program. During 2008, approximately 12.8 million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately $738.9 million under this program. We used the 2006 share repurchase program principally for share stabilization. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. and foreign government instruments and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. We attempt to mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well diversified portfolio that limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity, and investment type. In particular, the value of our investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio, and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in the value of the investments. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost which could adversely impact our financial position and our overall liquidity. The increase in cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008 is primarily due to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of shares under our share based compensation programs offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment, share repurchases, payments pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Acorda and other collaboration arrangements, and purchases of strategic investments. Borrowings There have been no significant changes in our borrowings since December 31, 2008. On March 4, 2008, we issued $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due March 1, 2013 and $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due March 1, 2018 for proceeds of $987.0 million, net of issuance costs. The credit rating on these notes at December 31, 2009, was Baa3 with a stable outlook by Moodys Investors Service and BBB+ with a stable outlook by Standard Poors. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of these notes, we entered into interest rate swaps, which were terminated in December 2008 and are further described in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We used the proceeds of this offering, along with cash and the proceeds from the liquidation of marketable securities, to repay the $1,500.0 million term loan facility we had entered into in July 2007 in connection with the funding of our June 2007 stock repurchase tender offer. In June 2007, we entered into a five year $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we may use for future working capital and general corporate purposes. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 resulted in the elimination of their $40.0 million commitment, thereby reducing the availability of the credit facility to $360.0 million. The terms of this revolving credit facility include various covenants, including financial covenants that require us to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and, under certain circumstances, an interest coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008 there were no borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with applicable covenants. Working Capital % Change 2009 As of December 31, Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 to 2008 Current assets $ 2,480.6 $ 2,458.0 0.9 % Current liabilities (714.9 ) (923.2 ) (22.6 )% Working capital $ 1,765.7 $ 1,534.8 15.0 % 50 Table of Contents We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. The increase in working capital primarily reflects the overall reduction of current liabilities by $208.3 million primarily driven by a $147.4 million reduction in balances attributable to taxes payable. The change in total current assets was negligible as increases in net receivable balances, inventory and other current assets were offset by decreases in cash and marketable and loaned securities. Cash Flows % Change 2009 2008 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 to 2008 to 2007 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,074.9 $ 1,562.4 $ 1,018.8 (31.2 )% 53.4 % Net cash flows used in investing activities $ (395.0 ) $ (365.9 ) $ (286.6 ) 8.0 % 27.7 % Net cash flows used in financing activities $ (724.2 ) $ (1,234.6 ) $ (733.3 ) (41.3 )% 68.4 % Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in working capital. We expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net income for: Non cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and share based compensation charges; Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily driven by change in other liabilities and taxes payable, primarily due to an increase in income tax payments of $373.4 million, primarily resulting from increased earnings and the settlement of various audits in 2009, the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda on July 1, 2009 and the payment of certain accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increase in cash from operating activities for 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to higher earnings net of a higher investment in working capital and the proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap. Investing Activities The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in collateral received under our securities lending program offset primarily by a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities and a reduction in purchases of property, plant and equipment. The decline in purchases of property, plant and equipment is primarily attributable to our Hillerd, Denmark manufacturing facility and certain other manufacturing upgrades which are near completion. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily due to an increase in net purchases of marketable securities, offset by cash proceeds from collateral received under securities lending. In 2009, significant cash flows related to investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of marketable securities of $229.1 million. Our other primary use of cash in investing activities consisted of the purchases of property, plant and equipment of $165.6 million. In 2008, significant cash flows related to investing activities consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of $222.8 million and net purchases of property, plant and equipment totaling $276.0 million. 51 Table of Contents In 2007, net proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $209.0 million were used to partially fund our 2007 tender offer. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $284.1 million in 2007. Payments made for acquisitions and collaborations were $95.8 million in 2007, which primarily related to our acquisition of Syntonix for $42.3 million and our collaboration payments to Cardiokine for $50.0 million and Neurimmune of $2.0 million. The change in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing activities. Additionally, in 2007 we sold our position in a strategic investment for $99.5 million. Financing Activities The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 is due, principally, to the repayment of our term loan facility of $1,500.0 million in 2008, offset by the issuance of our notes payable, a decrease in the amount of stock options exercised, and a decrease in obligations under our securities lending program. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2008 as compared to 2007 is due principally to a reduction in the net proceeds received from borrowings offset by an overall decrease in the amount of common stock repurchased. In 2009, we repurchased approximately 16.0 million shares for $751.2 million under our 2009 and 2006 share repurchase programs. The primary use of cash in 2008 was for the repayment of our term loan facility of $1,500.0 million and the repurchase of our common stock for $738.9 million, offset in part by the net proceeds of $987.0 million from the issuance of long term debt and proceeds of $178.5 million from the issuance of shares under our share based compensation programs. In 2007, the primary use of cash related to the repurchase of our common stock for $2,990.5 million by means of a tender offer. This repurchase was partially funded with cash proceeds from a short term note of $1,500.0 million. Additionally, cash proceeds from the issuance of shares under our share based compensation programs were $489.2 million, which was attributable to the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan. The change in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing activities. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding funding commitments, contingent milestone payments and other off balance sheet arrangements as described below) as of December 31, 2009, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 4 to 5 After (In millions) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Non cancellable operating leases(1) $ 381.8 $ 33.0 $ 63.0 $ 58.5 $ 227.3 Notes payable and line of credit(2) 1,442.0 84.9 143.8 535.1 678.2 Purchase obligations(3) 42.4 36.1 6.3 Defined benefit obligation 5.7 5.7 Contractual obligations $ 1,871.9 $ 154.0 $ 213.1 $ 593.6 $ 911.2 (1) Includes fifteen year lease on a 356,000 square foot office building in Weston, Massachusetts, which will serve as the future location of our general and administrative offices with a planned occupancy around mid year 2010. The initial lease term is from 2010 through 2025 under which the total minimum lease payments are $258.6 million. (2) Notes payable and line of credit includes principal and interest payments. 52 Table of Contents (3) Purchase obligations include our obligations of approximately $6.4 million pursuant to a dedicated resource agreement whereby a laboratory will provide us with dedicated services through 2010, $9.3 million related to the fair value of net liabilities on derivative contracts due in less than one year, approximately $12.0 million related to fixed obligations for the purchase of natural gas and $3.4 million in construction commitments related to our manufacturing facility in Hillerd, Denmark. The table above excludes tax payments totaling approximately $105.0 million to be made in the first half of 2010 related to the settlement of certain federal and state tax audits in 2009, and also excludes liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2009, we have approximately $52.6 million of long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. Funding Commitments As of December 31, 2009, we have funding commitments of up to approximately $24.8 million as part of our investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds. As of December 31, 2009, we have several ongoing clinical trials. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations (CROs). The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We have recorded accrued expenses of $31.7 million on our consolidated balance sheet for work done by CROs as of December 31, 2009. We have approximately $460.0 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts as of December 31, 2009 which are not included in the contractual obligations table above as they are cancellable. Contingent Milestone Payments Based on our development plans as of December 31, 2009, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $1,500.0 million as part of our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of December 31, 2009, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. We anticipate that we may pay approximately $82.0 million of milestone payments in 2010, provided various developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones are achieved. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not included in the contractual obligations table above as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones. These milestones may not be achieved. Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any significant relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We consolidate entities if we are the primary beneficiary. Legal Matters Please read Note 19, Litigation to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of legal matters as of December 31, 2009. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances, marketable 53 Table of Contents securities, derivatives and hedging activities, inventory, impairments of long lived assets including intangible assets, impairments of goodwill, income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, valuation of investments, research and development expenses, contingencies and litigation, and share based payments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition; Collaborative relationships; Clinical trial expenses; Consolidation of variable interest entities; Inventory; Investments; Impairment of financial instruments; Impairment of long lived assets including goodwill; Valuation of acquired intangible assets and IPRD; Share based compensation; Income taxes; and Contingencies. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Product Revenues Revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery. However, sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. are recognized on the sell through model, that is, upon shipment of the product by Elan to its third party distributor rather than upon shipment to Elan. The timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings. Reserves for Discounts and Allowances Revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, VA rebates, managed care rebates, product returns and other applicable allowances. Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. The estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition. Royalty Revenues We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we own rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of these licensed products. There are no future performance obligations on our part 54 Table of Contents under these license agreements. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties that have been paid to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to assess the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are adjusted for in the period in which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material when compared to actual amounts paid by licensees. To the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate revenues; we record such revenues on a cash basis. Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables In October 2009 a new accounting standard for the recognition of revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables was issued. This standard provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be separated, and how the consideration should be allocated. This new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. While we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations, this standard may impact us in the event we complete future transactions or modify existing collaborative relationships. Refer to Note 23, New Accounting Pronouncements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of this standard and its impact on us. Collaborative Relationships Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard for the accounting and disclosure of an entitys collaborative arrangements. This newly issued standard prescribes that certain transactions between collaborators be recorded in the income statement on either a gross or net basis, depending on the characteristics of the collaboration relationship. In accordance with this guidance, we must also evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper income statement classification based on the nature of the underlying activity. Amounts due from our collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to our operations. For collaborations with commercialized products, if we are the principal we record revenue and the corresponding operating costs in their respective line items within our consolidated statements of income. If we are not the principal, we record operating costs as a reduction of revenue. The Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification describes the principal as the party who is responsible for delivering the product or service to the customer, has latitude to determine price, and has the risks and rewards of providing product or service to the customer, including inventory and credit risk. As discussed within Note 17, Collaborations to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Genentech incurs the majority of continuing development cost for RITUXAN. Expenses incurred by Genentech in the development of RITUXAN are not recorded as research and development expense, but rather reduce our share of co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue. Clinical Trial Expenses Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of site management, monitoring costs, and project management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CROs to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities We consolidate variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. For such consolidated entities where we own less than a 100% interest, we record noncontrolling interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the third party equity interests. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, we consider a number of factors, including determining the expected losses and residual returns of the technologies being developed pursuant to collaborations and other economic risk and reward of such collaborations. 55 Table of Contents Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these analyses and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: assuming that the research and development efforts will result in an approved commercial product; estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting timing of regulatory approvals; estimating future cash inflows from product sales or funding from partners resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. These factors affect the way we account for certain collaborations. Future events may result in our consolidation of companies or related entities with which we have a collaborative arrangement. The consolidation of variable interest entities may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operation in future periods. Effective January 1, 2010, a new accounting standard will amend previously issued accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities and will affect how an enterprise determines whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This new standard may affect how we account for the consolidation of common structures, such as joint ventures, equity method investments, collaboration and other agreements and purchase arrangements. Under this revised guidance, the determination about whether an enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity is required to be evaluated continuously. Refer to Note 23, New Accounting Pronouncements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of this standard and its impact on us. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. Capitalization of Inventory Costs Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known constraints and impediments to approval, including safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization. We are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. We expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying value of our inventory did not include any costs associated with products that had not yet received regulatory approval. There is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods. 56 Table of Contents Obsolescence and Unmarketable Inventory We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. In the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we will record a charge to cost of sales to write down any obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. In all cases product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value. Investments We invest in various types of securities, including: short term and long term marketable securities, principally corporate notes, government securities including government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities and credit card and auto loan asset backed securities, in which our excess cash balances are invested; equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies, some of which have collaborative agreements with us; equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available; and investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds where fair value is not readily available. These investments are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards for certain investments in debt and equity securities. We monitor the financial performance of our portfolio of investments which are subject to concentration limits set within our investment policy to help mitigate and limit the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type. The objectives of this policy are safety of principal, liquidity and yield. In accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability. As noted in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements to our Consolidated Financial Statements, a majority of our financial assets and liabilities have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services. The pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. We validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming those securities trade in active markets. We also have some investments classified as Level 3 whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies. We apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties. While we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate, the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations. 57 Table of Contents Impairment of Financial Instruments Other than Temporary Impairments In April 2009, we implemented newly issued accounting standards which provide guidance for the recognition, measurement and presentation of other than temporary impairments. This newly issued standard amended the other than temporary impairment model for debt securities and requires additional disclosures regarding the calculation of credit losses and the factors considered in reaching a conclusion that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired. The impairment model for equity securities was not affected. Prior to our adoption of these new accounting standards in April 2009, we recognized all other than temporary impairment amounts related to our debt securities in earnings as required under the previously effective guidance which required that management assert that it had the ability and intent to hold a debt security until maturity or until we recovered the cost of our investment. Under the new accounting standards, an other than temporary impairment must be recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if an investor does not expect to sell a debt security, expected cash flows to be received must be evaluated to determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. The amount of losses relating to other factors, including those resulting from changes in interest rates, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Evaluating Investments for Other than Temporary Impairments We conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under the Investment for Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Codification. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on available for sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income. For available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the securitys decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss. Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security. For equity securities, when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary, we consider the fair market value of the security, the duration of the securitys decline, and the financial condition of the issuer. We then consider our intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover our carrying value. Where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery, the securitys decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss. Impairment of Long lived Assets including Goodwill Long lived Assets Other than Goodwill We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long lived assets to be held and used, including property plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider that could indicate a change in circumstances include, but are not limited to: a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset; 58 Table of Contents a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; a significant adverse change or development in strategy or operations that negatively impact the utilization of our long lived assets; a significant change in industry or economic trends; significant underperformance of the asset in relation to historical or projected future operating results; If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the assets residual value, if any. We derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. We did not recognize an impairment charge related to our long lived assets, other than goodwill, during 2009, 2008 and 2007. Goodwill We assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with the Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic of the Codification to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. The provisions of this guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of our reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference. We calculate the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing both an income approach and a market approach. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model with multiple scenarios for future growth. The discount is calculated based on our cost of capital rate. The market approach utilizes revenue and other metrics from similar publicly traded companies. The results of both fair value calculations are then compared to our reporting units carrying value. We completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008 and 2007 and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired. In each year, the fair value of our reporting unit, which includes goodwill, was significantly in excess of the carry value of our reporting unit. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions used in calculating fair value include identifying future cash flows, which requires that we make a number of critical legal, economic, market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date. We believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results, or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment. Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and In process Research and Development Expenses We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets primarily through the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we generally engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets 59 Table of Contents acquired. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting regulatory approvals; estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the IPRD analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. We account for business combinations completed on or after January 1, 2009 in accordance with the revised guidance for accounting for business combinations, which modifies the criteria that must be met to qualify as a business combination and prescribes new accounting requirements, including the accounting treatment associated with acquired IPRD. Before January 1, 2009 we measured acquired IPRD at fair value and expensed it on the acquisition date, or capitalized it as intangible assets if certain criteria were met. Effective January 1, 2009, acquired IPRD is measured at fair value and capitalized as intangible assets and tested for impairment until completion of programs and amortized from the date of completion over its estimated useful life. Share based Compensation We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation. In connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, we use the Black Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions. The key assumptions we make are: the expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the award; and the expected forfeiture rate. In connection with our restricted stock programs, we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate. In addition, for our performance vested restricted stock programs, we estimate the performance factor each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned. For example, performance vested restricted stock programs are usually based on company performance metrics such as annual revenue and earnings per share. Thus, during the performance period, we estimate our full year revenue and earnings per share and then adjust the performance factor after the completion of the full year. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments. New forms of equity awards are expected to be granted to certain employees beginning in 2010: restricted stock units which will vest based on market conditions and performance vested restricted stock units which will be settled in cash. The market based awards require the use of a binomial model or Monte Carlo simulation for valuation at grant date and include key assumptions such as the expected market price of the companys stock on the vest date and the expected number of vested shares. The cash settled awards will be marked to market at each period end with fluctuations in value reported through earnings. We will apply forfeiture rate assumptions similar to those utilized by us when accounting for our other share based compensation programs. Income Taxes In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences 60 Table of Contents result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Standards Please read Note 23, New Accounting Pronouncements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have operations in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, and India and throughout Europe in connection with the sale of AVONEX and TYSABRI and in Germany in connection with the sale of FUMADERM. We also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through Genentech on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, Danish kroner, Swedish krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation. The majority of our forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions 61 Table of Contents denominated in foreign currencies. We also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items. We have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items. The following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in both programs. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, a hypothetical adverse 10% movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities (for example, a strengthening of the Euro) would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately $64.4 million and $52.4 million, respectively. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions. Certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is, therefore, subject to changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point adverse movement (increase in LIBOR) would increase annual interest expense by approximately $0.2 million in each period. In addition, the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we estimate that such hypothetical adverse 100 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $16.9 million and $12.2 million, respectively, to our interest rate sensitive instruments. The returns from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change. A 100 basis point adverse movement (decrease) in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $12.5 million and $11.9 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. We regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
