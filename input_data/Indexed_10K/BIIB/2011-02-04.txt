Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page F 1 of this report. Executive Summary Introduction Biogen Idec is a global biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, manufacturing and marketing products for the treatment of neurological disorders and other serious diseases. We have four marketed products: AVONEX, TYSABRI, RITUXAN and FUMADERM. Patients worldwide benefit from our significant products used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), non Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohns disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and psoriasis. In the near term, our current and future revenues are dependent upon continued sales of our three principal products, AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI. In the longer term, our revenue growth will be dependent upon the successful pursuit of external business development opportunities and clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products as well as upon our ability to protect our patents related to our marketed products and assets originating from our research and development efforts. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels. On November 3, 2010, we announced a number of strategic, operational and organizational initiatives, which are described below under the heading Restructuring Charges. We expect to incur charges totaling approximately $110.0 million associated with the implementation of these initiatives, which are anticipated to be substantially completed by the end of 2011. Financial Highlights The following table is a summary of financial results achieved: For the Years Ended % Change December 31, 2010 2010 2009 Compared (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) (1) (2) (3) to 2009 Total revenues $ 4,716.4 $ 4,377.3 7.7 % Income from operations $ 1,248.9 $ 1,295.4 (3.6 )% Net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. $ 1,005.3 $ 970.1 3.6 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to Biogen Idec Inc $ 3.94 $ 3.35 17.6 % (1) Income from operations for 2010 was reduced by approximately $40.0 million related to the achievement of a milestone by Biogen Idec Hemophilia, Inc. (formerly Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and a $205.0 million charge incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with Knopp Neurosciences Inc. (Knopp), which we consolidated as we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of this relationship. The $205.0 million was partially offset by an attribution of $145.0 million to the noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest also includes a charge of $25.0 million related to the payment made in 2010 to Cardiokine Biopharma LLC (Cardiokine) pursuant to the termination of our lixivaptan collaboration. (2) Income from operations, as well as net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. for 2010, were reduced by the $75.2 million restructuring charge recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010. (3) Income from operations for 2009 was reduced by the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. related to our collaboration and license agreement dated June 30, 2009. As described below under Results of Operations, our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010, reflect the following: Worldwide AVONEX revenues totaled $2,518.4 million for 2010, representing an increase of 8.4% over 2009. 37 Table of Contents Our share of TYSABRI revenues totaled $900.2 million for 2010, representing an increase of 16.0% over 2009. Our share of RITUXAN revenues totaled $1,077.2 million for 2010, representing a decrease of 1.6% from 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by royalty expirations in our rest of world markets. Our share of revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world decreased 33.2% or $84.8 million from 2009. Our share of co promotion profits in the U.S. increased 9.6% or $74.4 million over 2009. Selling and development expenses incurred by us and reimbursed by Genentech, which are also included within our total unconsolidated joint business revenues, decreased 11.1% to $58.3 million from the prior year comparative period. Total cost and expenses increased 12.5% for 2010, compared to 2009. This increase was primarily driven by the $245.0 million IPRD charge and the $75.2 million restructuring charges recognized in 2010 as well as a 13.2% increase in selling, general and administrative costs and a 19.5% increase in collaboration profit sharing expense due to TYSABRI revenue growth, offset by a 27.9% decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, we generated $1,624.7 million of net cash flows from operations for 2010, which were primarily driven by earnings. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1,950.8 million as of December 31, 2010. In 2010, we repurchased approximately 40.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $2.1 billion under our 2010 and 2009 share repurchase authorizations. We retired all of these shares as they were acquired. Our 2010 and 2009 share repurchase programs were completed during the third and first quarters of 2010, respectively. Business Development Highlights In December 2010, we completed our acquisition of Panima Pharmaceuticals AG (Panima), an affiliate of Neurimmune AG. The purchase price is comprised of a $32.5 million cash payment, plus contingent consideration in the form of development milestones of up to $395.0 million in cash. Panima is involved in the discovery of antibodies designed to treat neurological disorders. For a more detailed description of this transaction, please read Note 2, Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. In October 2010, we amended our collaboration agreement with Genentech with regard to the development of ocrelizumab and agreed to terms for the development of GA101. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Genentech is responsible for the further development and commercialization of ocrelizumab and funding future costs. We will receive tiered royalties between 13.5% and 24% on U.S. sales of ocrelizumab. Commercialization of ocrelizumab will not impact our percentage of the co promotion profits for RITUXAN. In addition, we will pay 35% of the development and commercialization expenses of GA101 and will receive between 35% and 39% of the profits of GA101 based upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Commercialization of GA101 will impact our percentage of the co promotion profits for RITUXAN. This amendment did not have an impact on our share of the co promotion operating profits of RITUXAN in 2010. For a more detailed description of this collaboration, please read Note 19, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. In August 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Knopp Neurosciences, Inc. (Knopp), for the development, manufacture and commercialization of dexpramipexole, an orally administered small molecule in clinical development for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Under the terms of the license agreement we made a $26.4 million upfront payment and agreed to pay Knopp up to an additional $265.0 million in development and sales based milestone payments, as well as royalties on future commercial sales. For a more detailed description of this transaction, please read Note 18, Investments in Variable Interest Entities to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Business Environment We conduct our business primarily within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which are highly competitive. Many of our competitors are working to develop products similar to those we are developing or already market. We may also face increased competitive pressures as a result of the emergence of biosimilars. In the U.S., AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI are licensed under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) as biological 38 Table of Contents products. In March 2010, U.S. healthcare reform legislation amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve biological products, known as biosimilars or follow on biologics, that are shown to be highly similar to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. In addition, the recently enacted U.S. healthcare reform legislation contained additional provisions, including cost containment measures. We have encountered similar efforts to reform health care coverage and costs in other countries in which we operate. Moreover, the economic environment in Europe has become increasingly challenging. Many of the countries in which we operate are also seeking to reduce their public expenditures in light of the recent global economic downturn. The deterioration of the credit and economic conditions in certain countries in Europe has delayed reimbursement for our products and led to additional austerity measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs. Global efforts to reduce healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on product pricing and have negatively impacted our revenues and results of operations. For additional information about certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations, please read the Risk Factors section of this report. Results of Operations Revenues Revenues are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Product revenue United States $ 1,744.4 $ 1,638.0 $ 1,472.9 6.5 % 11.2 % Rest of world 1,725.7 1,514.9 1,366.8 13.9 % 10.8 % Total product revenues 3,470.1 3,152.9 2,839.7 10.1 % 11.0 % Unconsolidated joint business 1,077.2 1,094.9 1,128.2 (1.6 )% (3.0 )% Other revenues 169.1 129.5 129.6 30.6 % (0.1 )% Total revenues $ 4,716.4 $ 4,377.3 $ 4,097.5 7.7 % 6.8 % Product Revenues Product revenues are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 AVONEX $ 2,518.4 $ 2,322.9 $ 2,202.6 8.4 % 5.5 % TYSABRI 900.2 776.0 588.6 16.0 % 31.8 % Other 51.5 54.0 48.5 (4.6 )% 11.3 % Total product revenues $ 3,470.1 $ 3,152.9 $ 2,839.7 10.1 % 11.0 % 39 Table of Contents AVONEX Revenues from AVONEX are summarized as follows: % Change 2010 2009 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 United States $ 1,491.6 $ 1,406.2 $ 1,276.5 6.1 % 10.2 % Rest of world 1,026.8 916.7 926.1 12.0 % (1.0 )% Total AVONEX revenues $ 2,518.4 $ 2,322.9 $ 2,202.6 8.4 % 5.5 % For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in U.S. AVONEX revenue was due to price increases offset by decreased commercial demand. Decreased commercial demand resulted in declines of approximately 6% and 8% in U.S. AVONEX unit sales volume for 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the prior year comparative periods. Our 2010 U.S. AVONEX revenue was also negatively impacted by reserves established for rebates and allowances related to the newly enacted healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. In addition, we continued to experience higher participation in our Access Program, which provides free product to eligible patients for both the 2010 and 2009 comparative periods. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in rest of world AVONEX revenue was due to increased commercial demand offset by price decreases in some countries and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against relevant foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in rest of world AVONEX revenue was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes, offset by increased commercial demand and price increases in some countries. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately 6% in rest of world AVONEX sales volume for 2010 and 2009 in both periods. AVONEX rest of world revenues for 2010 also include gains recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program totaling $35.0 million, compared to losses recognized of $39.5 million and $8.5 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect AVONEX to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace in both the U.S. and rest of world. A number of companies, including us, are working to develop products to treat MS that may compete with AVONEX now and in the future, including oral and other alternative formulations. In addition, the continued growth of TYSABRI and the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of AVONEX. Increased competition may lead to reduced unit sales of AVONEX, as well as increasing price pressure. TYSABRI We collaborate with Elan Pharma International, Ltd (Elan) an affiliate of Elan Corporation, plc, on the development and commercialization of TYSABRI. For a more detailed description of this collaboration, please read Note 19, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Revenues from TYSABRI are summarized as follows: % Change 2010 2009 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 United States $ 252.8 $ 231.8 $ 196.4 9.1 % 18.0 % Rest of world 647.4 544.2 392.2 19.0 % 38.8 % Total TYSABRI revenues $ 900.2 $ 776.0 $ 588.6 16.0 % 31.8 % For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in U.S. TYSABRI revenue was due to increased commercial demand. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately 10% 40 Table of Contents and 16% in U.S. TYSABRI unit sales volume for 2010 and 2009, respectively, over the prior year comparative periods. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase was also due to price increases. This increase was offset by the impact of the sale of previously written down TYSABRI inventory, which became saleable following the approval of our higher yielding manufacturing process. As our sales price to Elan in the U.S. is set to effect an approximate equal sharing of the gross margin with Elan plus reimbursement for our cost of goods sold, the distribution of this specific inventory reduced our cost of sales, which reduced the price per unit we charged to Elan and reduced our revenues by $7.5 million compared to 2009. This inventory was fully utilized during 2010. Net sales of TYSABRI from our collaboration partner, Elan, to third party customers in the U.S. for 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $593.1 million, $508.5 million and $421.6 million, respectively. For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in rest of world TYSABRI revenue was due to increased commercial demand of TYSABRI in our rest of world markets offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against relevant foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in rest of world TYSABRI revenue was partially offset by price decreases in some countries. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of 23% and 49% in rest of world TYSABRI sales volume for 2010 and 2009, respectively, over the prior year comparative periods. TYSABRI rest of world revenues for 2010 also include gains recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program totaling $10.7 million, compared to losses recognized of $10.1 million for 2009. No such losses were recognized in 2008 as we did not designate hedges against TYSABRI rest of world revenues in that period. The prescribing information for TYSABRI contains significant safety warnings, including: TYSABRI increases the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious brain infection. The risk of PML is increased in patients who have been treated with an immunosuppressant prior to receiving TYSABRI. The risk of developing PML increases with longer treatment duration, with limited experience beyond three years. Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) may occur in patients who developed PML and subsequently discontinued TYSABRI. These safety warnings, and any future safety related label changes, may limit the growth of TYSABRI unit sales. We continue to research and develop protocols and therapies that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of PML in patients. For example, our efforts have included working to identify patient or viral characteristics which contribute to the risk of developing PML, including the presence of asymptomatic JC virus infection with an assay to detect an immune response against the JC virus. We have initiated two clinical studies in the U.S., known as STRATIFY 1 and STRATIFY 2, that collectively, are intended to define the prevalence of serum JC virus antibody in patients with relapsing MS receiving or considering treatment with TYSABRI and to evaluate the potential to stratify patients into lower or higher risk for developing PML based on antibody status. Our efforts to stratify patients into lower or higher risk for developing PML, and other ongoing or future clinical trials involving TYSABRI may have a negative impact on prescribing behavior in at least the short term which may result in decreased product revenues from sales of TYSABRI. We also expect TYSABRI to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace in both the U.S. and rest of world. A number of companies, including us, are working to develop products to treat MS that may compete with TYSABRI now and in the future, including oral and other alternative formulations. In addition, the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of TYSABRI. Increased competition may also lead to reduced unit sales of TYSABRI, as well as increasing price pressure. We have initiated the five year renewal process for TYSABRIs marketing authorization in the E.U. This marketing authorization review by E.U. regulators, in addition to ongoing label discussions with U.S. regulators, 41 Table of Contents includes assessment of the criteria for confirming PML diagnosis, the number of PML cases, the incidence of PML in TYSABRI patients, the risk factors for PML, as well as an overall assessment of TYSABRIs benefit risk profile. Our interactions with E.U. and U.S. regulators could result in modifications to the respective labels or other restrictions for TYSABRI. Upon completion of the assessment of the TYSABRI renewal in the E.U. the marketing authorization is expected to be valid for either an unlimited period or for an additional five year term. Other Product Revenues Other product revenues primarily consist of revenues derived from sales of FUMADERM and are summarized as follows: % Change 2010 2009 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 FUMADERM $ 51.2 $ 49.6 $ 43.4 3.2 % 14.3 % Other $ 0.3 $ 4.4 $ 5.1 (93.2 )% (13.7 )% Total other product revenues $ 51.5 $ 54.0 $ 48.5 (4.6 )% 11.3 % Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenues We collaborate with Genentech on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN. On October 19, 2010, we and Genentech amended and restated our Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement dated June 19, 2003 with regard to the development of ocrelizumab, a humanized anti CD20 antibody, and agreed to terms for the development of GA101, a next generation anti CD20 antibody. This amendment did not have an impact on our share of the co promotion operating profits recognized for RITUXAN in 2010. For a more detailed description of this collaboration and additional information regarding the pretax co promotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and its impact on future unconsolidated joint business revenues, please read Note 19, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. In the fourth quarter of 2010, as part of our recent restructuring initiative, which is described below under the heading Restructuring Charge, we reached an agreement with Genentech to eliminate our RITUXAN oncology and rheumatology sales force, with Genentech assuming the sole responsibility for the U.S. sales and marketing efforts related to RITUXAN. We believe that centralizing the sales force will enhance the sales effectiveness and profitability of our collaboration for the sale of RITUXAN in the U.S. As a result of this change, we expect that the amount of reimbursement for selling and development expense in the U.S. to decrease in future periods to a negligible amount. For 2010, 2009, and 2008, we were reimbursed $58.3 million, $65.6 million and $59.7 million, respectively, primarily for sales and marketing activities performed in support of RITUXAN. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Biogen Idecs share of co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 848.0 $ 773.6 $ 733.5 9.6 % 5.5 % Reimbursement of selling and development expenses in the U.S. 58.3 65.6 59.7 (11.1 )% 9.9 % Revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world 170.9 255.7 335.0 (33.2 )% (23.7 )% Total unconsolidated joint business revenues $ 1,077.2 $ 1,094.9 $ 1,128.2 (1.6 )% (3.0 )% 42 Table of Contents Biogen Idecs Share of Co Promotion Profits in the U.S. The following table provides a summary of amounts comprising our share of co promotion profits in the U.S.: % Change 2010 2009 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Product revenues, net $ 2,759.2 $ 2,665.5 $ 2,587.4 3.5 % 3.0 % Costs and expenses 626.8 724.1 741.0 (13.4 )% (2.3 )% Co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 2,132.4 $ 1,941.4 $ 1,846.4 9.8 % 5.1 % Biogen Idecs share of co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 848.0 $ 773.6 $ 733.5 9.6 % 5.5 % For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in U.S. RITUXAN product revenues was primarily due to price increases and an increase in commercial demand, which resulted in an increase in unit sales volume of approximately 2%. For 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in U.S. RITUXAN product revenue was primarily due to price increases offset by a decrease in commercial demand of approximately 1%. For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in collaboration costs and expenses primarily resulted from a decline in expenditures for the development of RITUXAN for use in other indications. As described below under the heading Provision for Discounts and Allowances Healthcare Reform, beginning in 2011, a new fee will be payable by all prescription drug manufacturers and importers. We estimate that the fee assessed Genentech on qualifying sales of RITUXAN will result in a reduction of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S. of approximately $15.0 million in 2011. Under our collaboration agreement, our current pretax co promotion profit sharing formula, which resets annually, provides for a 40% share of co promotion profits if co promotion operating profits exceed $50.0 million. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, the 40% threshold was met during the first quarter. Reimbursement of Selling and Development Expense in the U.S. As discussed in Note 19, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, Genentech incurs the majority of continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Expenses incurred by Genentech in the development of RITUXAN are not recorded as research and development expense, but rather reduce our share of co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue. For 2010 compared to 2009, the decrease in selling and development expenses incurred by us in the U.S. and reimbursed by Genentech was primarily the result of the elimination of our RITUXAN oncology and rheumatology sales force in the fourth quarter 2010. For 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in selling and development expenses incurred by us in the U.S. and reimbursed by Genentech was primarily the result of our increased sales and marketing activities in support of RITUXAN. Revenue on Sales of RITUXAN in the Rest of World Revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world consists of our share of pretax co promotion profits in Canada and royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and Canada. For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, revenues on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world continue to decline due to royalty expirations in certain of our rest of world markets. The royalty period for sales in the rest of world with respect to all products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis. Specifically, the royalty periods with respect to sales in France, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom expired in 2009. The royalty period with respect to sales in Italy expired in 2010. The royalty periods for substantially all of the remaining royalty bearing sales of RITUXAN in the rest of the world will expire through 2012. As a result of these expirations, we expect royalty revenues derived from sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world to continue to decline in future periods. The decreases experienced during 2010 were offset by a payment from Genentech totaling $21.3 million representing a cumulative underpayment of royalties owed to us on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world. 43 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Royalty revenues $ 137.4 $ 124.4 $ 116.2 10.5 % 7.1 % Corporate partner revenues 31.7 5.1 13.4 521.6 % (61.9 )% Total other revenues $ 169.1 $ 129.5 $ 129.6 30.6 % (0.1 )% Royalty Revenues We receive royalties on sales by our licensees of products covered under patents that we own. Sales of licensed products could vary significantly due to competition, manufacturing difficulties and other factors that are not within our control. In addition, the expiration or invalidation of any underlying patents could reduce or eliminate the royalty revenues derived from such patents. For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in royalty revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of ANGIOMAX (bivalirudin) licensed to The Medicines Company (TMC). The increase for 2009 compared to 2008 was offset by a decline in royalties from sales of other licensed products and the expiration of certain contracts and license agreements. Our most significant source of royalty revenue is derived from sales of ANGIOMAX by TMC. TMC sells ANGIOMAX in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Central America, South America, Israel and Australia. Royalty revenues related to the sales of ANGIOMAX are recognized in an amount equal to the level of net sales achieved during a calendar year multiplied by the royalty rate in effect for that tier under our agreement with TMC. The royalty rate increases based upon which tier of total net sales are earned in any calendar year. The increased royalty rate is applied retroactively to the first dollar of net sales achieved during the year. This formula has the effect of increasing the amount of royalty revenue to be recognized in later quarters and, as a result, an adjustment is recorded in the period in which an increase in royalty rate has been achieved. Under the terms of our agreement, TMC is obligated to pay us royalties earned, on a country by country basis, until the later of (1) twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of ANGIOMAX in such country or (2) the date upon which the product is no longer covered by a patent in such country. The annual royalty rate is reduced by a specified percentage in any country where the product is no longer covered by a patent and where sales have been reduced to a certain volume based market share. TMC began selling ANGIOMAX in the U.S. in January 2001. The principal U.S. patent that covers ANGIOMAX was due to expire in March 2010 and TMC applied for an extension of the term of this patent. Initially, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected TMCs application because in its view the application was not timely filed. TMC sued the PTO in federal district court seeking to extend the term of the principal U.S. patent to December 2014. On August 3, 2010, the federal district court ordered the PTO to deem the application as timely filed. The PTO did not appeal the order, but a generic manufacturer is seeking the right to intervene and file an appeal. The PTO has granted an interim extension of the patent term until August 13, 2011. In the event that TMC is unsuccessful in obtaining a patent term extension thereafter and third parties sell products comparable to ANGIOMAX, we would expect a significant decrease in royalty revenues due to increased competition, which may impact sales and result in lower royalty tiered rates. Corporate Partner Revenues We have also sold or exclusively licensed to third parties rights to certain products previously included within our product line. Royalty or supply agreement revenues received based upon those products are recorded as corporate partner revenue. Amounts recorded as corporate partner revenue also include amounts earned upon delivery of product under contract manufacturing agreements. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to amounts earned under the terms of our 2006 contract manufacturing agreement with Astellas Pharma US, Inc. for the supply of 44 Table of Contents AMEVIVE. For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to milestone and royalty payments received in 2008 totaling $7.0 million related to ZEVALIN. Provisions for Discounts and Allowances Revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration (VA) and Public Health Service (PHS) discounts, managed care rebates, product returns, and other applicable allowances. Reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Reserves for discounts, contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Discounts $ 77.9 $ 74.0 $ 67.1 5.3 % 10.3 % Contractual adjustments 282.6 192.5 149.0 46.8 % 29.2 % Returns 14.3 16.6 12.2 (13.9 )% 36.1 % Total allowances $ 374.8 $ 283.1 $ 228.3 32.4 % 24.0 % Gross product revenues $ 3,844.9 $ 3,436.0 $ 3,068.0 11.9 % 12.0 % Percent of gross product revenues 9.7 % 8.2 % 7.4 % 18.3 % 10.8 % Discount reserves include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives. For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in discounts was primarily driven by increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives as a result of price increases and increased sales. Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid and managed care rebates, VA and PHS discounts and other applicable allowances. For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in contractual adjustments was due to the impact of higher reserves for managed care and Medicaid and VA programs primarily associated with price increases in the U.S. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in contractual adjustments was also due to the impact of higher contractual rebates and discounts resulting from U.S. healthcare reform legislation passed in March 2010, as further discussed below. Product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. We also accept returns from our patients for various reasons. Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales. For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, return reserves remained relatively unchanged. Healthcare Reform In 2010, healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the U.S. This legislation contains several provisions that affect our business. Although many provisions of the new legislation do not take effect immediately, several provisions became effective in 2010. These include (1) an increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate to states participating in the Medicaid program from 15.1% to 23.1% on our branded prescription drugs; (2) the extension of the Medicaid rebate to Managed Care Organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries; and (3) the expansion of the 340B PHS drug pricing program, which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates, to include additional hospitals, clinics, and healthcare centers. Beginning in 2011, the new law also requires drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause them to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the donut hole). Also, in 2011, a new fee will be payable by all branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers. This fee will be calculated based upon each organizations percentage share of total branded prescription 45 Table of Contents drug sales to qualifying U.S. government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid and VA and PHS discount programs). As defined by the Act, branded prescription drug sales exclude the sales of any drug or biologic for which an orphan drug tax credit was allowed and was not subsequently approved for a non orphan indication. As AVONEX has no other labeled indications, other than that for which it received its orphan designation, we believe that AVONEX sales are considered exempt from the fee. We estimate that the fee assessed to Genentech on qualifying sales of RITUXAN will result in a reduction of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S. of approximately $15.0 million in 2011. We will reflect our share of the fee assessed to Elan on qualifying sales of TYSABRI as selling, general and administrative expense, which we do not expect to be significant based on expected sales for qualifying U.S. government programs. This new legislation contains a number of provisions that affect existing government programs and has required the creation of new programs, policies and processes, many of which remain under development and have not been fully implemented. For example, we do not yet fully know the extent of additional entities eligible to participate under the 340B program or when and how discounts will be provided to these entities. In addition, in November 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) amended and then withdrew current regulations governing calculation of Average Manufacture Price; however, no replacement regulations have been proposed. Accordingly, our discounts and allowances are based on several assumptions about the implementation of this legislation. Actual results may differ from our estimates. In addition, we anticipate that many countries outside the U.S. will continue to implement austerity measures including efforts aimed at reducing healthcare costs as these countries attempt to manage increasing healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the global economic downturn and the deterioration of the credit and economic conditions in certain countries in Europe. For example, certain governments of countries in which we operate have already implemented or may implement measures to reduce or control healthcare costs that, among other things, include imposed price reductions, suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals, increased mandatory discounts and rebates or seek recoveries of past price increases. Certain measures already implemented have negatively impacted our revenues. Our revenues and results of operations will be further negatively impacted if these, similar or more extensive measures continue to be implemented. Cost and Expenses A summary of total cost and expenses is as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 400.3 $ 382.1 $ 402.0 4.8 % (5.0 )% Research and development 1,248.6 1,283.1 1,072.1 (2.7 )% 19.7 % Selling, general and administrative 1,031.5 911.0 925.3 13.2 % (1.5 )% Collaboration profit sharing 258.1 215.9 136.0 19.5 % 58.8 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 208.9 289.8 332.7 (27.9 )% (12.9 )% Restructuring charge 75.2 ** ** Acquired in process research and development 245.0 25.0 ** (100.0 )% Gain on dispositions, net (9.2 ) ** (100.0 )% Total cost and expenses $ 3,467.5 $ 3,081.9 $ 2,883.9 12.5 % 6.9 % 46 Table of Contents Cost of Sales, Excluding Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets (Cost of Sales) % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 400.3 $ 382.1 $ 402.0 4.8 % (5.0 )% For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher unit sales volume. The increase for the comparative period was also driven by a $5.7 million increase in costs associated with contract manufacturing activity for the supply of AMEVIVE as well as $6.7 million of period expense incurred related to the shutdown for capital upgrades of our manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. This comparative increase was offset by the sale of previously written down TYSABRI inventory, which became saleable following approval of our new higher yielding manufacturing process. The distribution of this inventory, which was fully utilized during 2010, reduced our cost of sales by $11.4 million compared to 2009. In addition, the sale of inventory produced under our new high titer production process reduced our cost of sales by $8.4 million compared to 2009. For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a $12.9 million decrease in write downs from unmarketable inventory, a $10.9 million decrease in production costs due to the implementation of a new high titer production process which produces higher yields of TYSABRI and an $8.8 million decrease in royalty payments on sales of licensed product due mainly to the expiration of certain contracts and license agreements. These decreases were offset by a $17.0 million increase in costs associated with higher TYSABRI unit sales volume. In addition, during 2008 we also incurred a $4.3 million period expense related to the shutdown of our manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina for the implementation of the high titer production process upgrades. We expect an increase in total cost of sales for 2011, as a result of an increase in expected contract manufacturing activity and increased production costs. Write downs from Unmarketable Inventory Our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. The expiry associated with our inventory is generally between 6 months and 5 years, depending on the product. Obsolescence due to expiration has historically been insignificant. Amounts written down related to unmarketable inventory are charged to cost of sales, and totaled $11.8 million, $16.9 million and $29.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and Development % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Research and development $ 1,248.6 $ 1,283.1 $ 1,072.1 (2.7 )% 19.7 % For 2010 compared to 2009, research and development expense decreased by $34.5 million. Our research and development spend in 2010 included a $26.4 million upfront payment made to Knopp under a license agreement, increased clinical activity for our daclizumab, PEGylated interferon beta 1a, Neublastin, Factor VIII and Factor IX programs, and efforts to research and develop protocols that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of PML in patients treated with TYSABRI. In addition, our costs for the Factor VIII and Factor IX programs increased in 2010 following the restructuring of our collaboration agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, whereby we assumed full development and manufacturing responsibilities for these programs. These increases were offset by a reduction in spending in certain deprioritized programs. 47 Table of Contents For 2009 compared to 2008, research and development expenses increased by $211.0 million, driven primarily by the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda, as well as a net increase of $100.2 million related to the ramp up of clinical trial activity for certain development stage product candidates including lixivaptan, BG 12, humanized anti CD20 and ADENTRI. In addition, in 2009, we also initiated registrational trials in our PEGylated interferon program. The aforementioned increases were offset by a reduction of spending across several programs including baminercept in RA, lumiliximab and volociximab. As part of our recent restructuring initiative, which is described below under the heading Restructuring Charge, we are in the process of reducing our overall headcount by approximately 13% and have terminated or are in the process of discontinuing certain research and development programs, including substantially all of our cardiovascular and oncology programs and select programs in neurology and immunology. Our workforce reduction efforts impact all sales, research and development and administrative functions. We expect total research and development expense in 2011 to be between 22% and 24% of total revenue. Milestone and Upfront Payments Milestone and upfront payments to our collaboration partners, included within research and development expense, totaled $68.9 million, $151.5 million and $47.6 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The change for each of the comparative periods was primarily the result of the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda in 2009. The timing of future upfront fees and milestone payments may cause variability in future research and development expense. Selling, General and Administrative % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,031.5 $ 911.0 $ 925.3 13.2 % (1.5 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel, outside marketing and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. For 2010 compared to 2009, selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities in support of AVONEX and TYSABRI and increased grant and sponsorship activity. The increase for the comparative periods also includes an incremental charge of approximately $18.6 million recognized in 2010 related to the modification of equity based compensation in accordance with the transition agreement entered into with James C. Mullen, who retired as our President and Chief Executive Officer on June 8, 2010. For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a reduction of expenses reimbursed to Elan for their marketing of TYSABRI for Crohns disease in the U.S. These decreases were offset by costs incurred associated with our geographic expansion into new markets. As part of our recent restructuring initiative, which is described below under the heading Restructuring Charge, we are in the process of reducing our overall headcount by approximately 13%. This workforce reduction impacts all sales, research and development and administrative functions. We expect total selling, general and administrative expense in 2011 to be between 20% and 21% of total revenue. 48 Table of Contents Collaboration Profit Sharing % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Collaboration profit sharing $ 258.1 $ 215.9 $ 136.0 19.5 % 58.7 % For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, the increases in collaboration profit sharing expense were due to the continued increase in TYSABRI rest of world sales resulting in higher rest of world net operating profits to be shared with Elan and resulting in growth in the third party royalties Elan paid on behalf of the collaboration. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, our collaboration profit sharing expense included $45.5 million, $40.0 million and $28.4 million related to the reimbursement of third party royalty payments made by Elan. For a more detailed description of this collaboration, please read Note 19, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 208.9 $ 289.8 $ 332.7 (27.9 )% (12.9 )% Our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our AVONEX product. Our amortization policy reflects our belief that the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our AVONEX product. We refer to this amortization methodology as the economic consumption model, which involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of AVONEX is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle, and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model. Although we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset, the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances, due to continued sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise. In order to ensure that amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods, we compare the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model against the minimum amount of amortization recalculated each year under the straight line method and record the higher amount. We completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of 2010. This analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis, such as the anticipated product sales of AVONEX and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates, as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents. Based upon this analysis, we have continued to amortize this asset on the economic consumption model for the third and fourth quarters of 2010, and expect to apply the same model for the next two quarters. In addition, since we do not currently expect a significant change in the expected lifetime revenue of AVONEX, amortization expected to be recorded in relation to our core intangible asset for the first two quarters of 2011 is anticipated to be comparable to the amounts recorded during the third and fourth quarters of 2010. Amortization of our core intangible asset related to AVONEX totaled $162.4 million, $229.3 million and $271.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For 2009 compared to 2008, amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 decreased significantly from their respective prior year comparative periods. This decrease was driven by the issuance of the AVONEX 755 Patent in September 2009. The issuance of this patent, expiring in September 2026, resulted in an increase in the total expected lifetime revenue of AVONEX and an extension of the assumed remaining life of our core intangible asset. Based upon our most recent analysis, amortization for acquired intangible assets is expected to be in the range of approximately $170.0 million to $210.0 million annually through 2015. 49 Table of Contents We monitor events and expectations on product performance. If there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of AVONEX determined during our most recent annual review. For example, the occurrence of an adverse event, such as the invalidation of our AVONEX 755 Patent issued in September 2009, could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations. Restructuring Charge % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Restructuring charge $ 75.2 $ $ ** ** On November 3, 2010, we announced a number of strategic, operational and organizational initiatives designed to provide a framework for the future growth of our business, which are summarized as follows: We intend to focus our business on neurology and leverage our strengths in biologics research, development and manufacturing to pursue select biological therapies where there is a significant unmet need and where the drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2010, we began to reallocate resources within our research and development organization to maximize our investment in our highest potential programs. As a result, we have terminated or are in the process of discontinuing certain research and development programs, including substantially all of our oncology programs (which we are looking to spin out or out license), our cardiovascular programs and select neurology and immunology programs. In addition, we have substantially reduced our small molecule discovery activities in favor of outsourcing these efforts. We are in the process of vacating the San Diego, California facility and consolidating our Massachusetts facilities. We eliminated our RITUXAN oncology and rheumatology sales force and Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned member of the Roche Group, has assumed sole responsibility for the U.S. sales and marketing efforts related to RITUXAN. We are in the process of completing a 13% reduction in our workforce and realigning our overall structure to become a more efficient and cost effective organization. The workforce reduction spans our sales, research and development and administrative functions. As a result of these initiatives, we expect to realize annual savings of approximately $300.0 million. The substantial majority of the savings will be realized within research and development and selling, general and administrative expense and are expected to be fully realized beginning in the latter half of 2011. These expected savings may be offset to some degree by costs associated with initiatives to grow our business. We expect to incur total restructuring charges of approximately $110.0 million, comprised of $90.0 million for workforce reduction and $20.0 million for facility consolidation. We recognized $75.2 million of these charges within our consolidated statement of income during 2010, which are summarized as follows: For the Year Ended (In millions) December 31, 2010 Workforce reduction $ 67.2 Facility consolidation 8.0 Total restructuring charges $ 75.2 50 Table of Contents We expect that our restructuring efforts will be substantially completed, and that substantially all of the remaining restructuring charges will be incurred by the end of 2011. Costs associated with our workforce reduction primarily relate to employee severance and benefits. Facility consolidation costs are primarily comprised of charges associated with the closing of facilities, related lease obligations and additional depreciation recognized when the expected useful lives of certain assets have been shortened due to the consolidation and closing of related facilities and the discontinuation of certain research and development programs. The following table summarizes the charges and spending related to our restructuring efforts during 2010: Workforce Facility (In millions) Reduction Consolidation Total Reserves established $ 67.2 $ 8.0 $ 75.2 Amounts paid (6.6 ) (6.6 ) Additional depreciation and other non cash charges (2.2 ) (2.2 ) Restructuring reserves at December 31, 2010 $ 60.6 $ 5.8 $ 66.4 We expect that substantially all remaining payments will be made, by the end of 2011. Acquired In Process Research and Development (IPRD) % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Acquired in process research and development $ 245.0 $ $ 25.0 ** (100.0 )% In August 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Knopp for the development, manufacture and commercialization of dexpramipexole, an orally administered small molecule in clinical development for the treatment of ALS. As we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of Knopp, we consolidate the results of Knopp and recorded an IPRD charge of approximately $205.0 million upon initial consolidation. We have attributed approximately $145.0 million of the total IPRD charge to the noncontrolling interest, representing the noncontrolling interests ownership interest in the equity of Knopp. For a more detailed description of this transaction, please read Note 18, Investments in Variable Interest Entities to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. In connection with our acquisition of Biogen Idec Hemophilia Inc., formerly Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Syntonix), in January 2007, we agreed to make additional future consideration payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events. One of these milestones was achieved when, in January 2010, we initiated patient enrollment in a registrational trial of Factor IX in hemophilia B. As a result of the achievement of this we paid approximately $40.0 million to the former shareholders of Syntonix. In 2008, we recorded an IPRD charge of $25.0 million related to a HSP90 related milestone payment made to the former shareholders of Conforma Therapeutics, Inc. (Conforma) pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of Conforma in 2006. 51 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Components of other income (expense), net, are summarized as follows: % Change For the Years Ended 2010 2009 December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Interest income $ 22.3 $ 48.5 $ 72.1 (54.0 )% (32.7 )% Interest expense (36.1 ) (35.8 ) (52.0 ) (0.8 )% 31.2 % Impairments of investments (21.3 ) (10.6 ) (60.3 ) (100.9 )% 82.4 % Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net 16.3 22.8 (1.1 ) (28.5 )% 2172.7 % Foreign exchange gains (losses), net (3.5 ) 11.4 (9.8 ) (130.7 )% 216.3 % Other, net 3.3 1.0 (6.6 ) 230.0 % 114.9 % Total other income (expense), net $ (19.0 ) $ 37.3 $ (57.7 ) (151.0 )% 164.5 % Interest Income For 2010 compared to 2009, as well as for 2009 compared to 2008, interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The decrease for 2010 compared to 2009, was also due to lower average cash balances. For 2009 compared to 2008, these decreases were offset by higher average cash balances. Interest Expense For 2010 compared to 2009, interest expense remained relatively unchanged. For 2009 compared to 2008, interest expense decreased primarily due to decreased average debt balances. In addition, approximately $5.7 million and $5.4 million was recorded in 2010 and 2009, respectively, as a reduction of interest expense due to the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the termination of an interest rate swap in December 2008. Capitalized Interest Costs For 2010, 2009, and 2008, we capitalized interest costs related to construction in progress totaling approximately $28.6 million, $28.5 million and $23.2 million, respectively, which reduced our interest expense by the same amount. Capitalized interest costs are primarily related to the development of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerd, Denmark. We plan to stop further validation on this facility following completion of facilitys operational qualification activities in the first half of 2011 as we continue to evaluate our current manufacturing utilization strategy. Recent manufacturing improvements have resulted in favorable production yields on TYSABRI, that along with slower than expected TYSABRI growth, have reduced our expected capacity requirements. As a result, we have decided to delay the start of manufacturing activities at this site until additional capacity is required by the business. Accordingly, we expect to cease capitalizing interest in relation to this project at that time. Impairment on Investments In 2010, we recognized $21.3 million in charges for the other than temporary impairment of our publicly held strategic investments, investments in venture capital funds and investments in privately held companies. The increase over amounts recognized in 2009 was primarily the result of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of our strategic investments, executing an equity offering at a price below our cost basis during the first quarter of 2010. In 2009, we recognized impairment losses of $7.0 million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional $3.6 million in charges for the other than temporary impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage and asset backed securities. 52 Table of Contents In 2008, we recognized impairment losses of $18.6 million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional $41.7 million in impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage and asset backed and corporate securities. We may incur additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. Income Tax Provision % Change 2010 2009 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Effective tax rate on pre tax income 26.9 % 26.7 % 31.6 % 0.7 % (15.5 )% Income tax expense $ 331.3 $ 355.6 $ 365.8 (6.8 )% (2.8 )% Our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the nature of our global operations. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings between multiple jurisdictions, changes in tax laws, acquisitions and licensing transactions. For 2010 compared to 2009, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted due to the attribution to noncontrolling interest of $145.0 million of the IPRD charge related to our license agreement with Knopp Neurosciences, Inc. As such, the attributed amount will not generate a tax deduction, causing our tax rate to be unfavorably impacted by 2.8%. The impact of the Knopp transaction was partially offset by a higher percentage of our profits being earned in lower rate international jurisdictions in 2010. This change in the location of our relative profits was caused by the growth of our international operations and lower 2010 domestic earnings as a proportion of total consolidated earnings. For a more detailed description of our transaction with Knopp, please read Note 18, Investments in Variable Interest Entities to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. During 2010, we also experienced a favorable impact on our effective tax rates due to a statutory increase in the U.S. manufacturers tax deduction and an increase in expenditures eligible for our orphan drug credit. In December 2010, an extension of the research and development tax credit was enacted for years 2010 and 2011. Upon enactment, we recognized an income tax benefit of $14.9 million for qualifying expenditures from the full year 2010. In addition, our 2009 effective tax rate was increased by 2.1% as a result of the $110.0 million upfront payment incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Acorda) in the second quarter of 2009. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was also favorably impacted by 2.3% for changes in tax law which became effective during the first quarter of 2009 in certain state jurisdictions in which we operate and the favorable resolution of certain federal, state and foreign tax audits. The resolution of these tax audits resulted in a reduction of our reserves for several uncertain tax positions, which had a favorable impact of 2.1% on our 2009 effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in 2009 was lower than in 2008 due to the net effect of changes in tax laws and the resolution of certain tax audits discussed above, as well as a higher percentage of our foreign earnings being subject to U.S. income taxation in 2008 partially offset by the effect of the Acorda licensing transaction. The effect of the allocation of earnings was partially offset by certain tax credits and deferred tax assets realized as a result of our 2008 domestic reorganization. Our 2008 domestic and foreign reorganizations to our corporate structure involved the movement of certain personnel, operations and processes amongst our affiliates. Our effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the allocation of our profits amongst jurisdictions and the percentage of our foreign earnings which are subject to taxation in the U.S. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be between 26% and 28%. 53 Table of Contents Noncontrolling Interest % Change 2010 2009 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax $ (106.7 ) $ 6.9 $ 6.9 (1,639.7 )% 0.0 % For 2010 compared to 2009, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $113.6 million. This decrease was primarily the result of the attribution of $145.0 million of the $205.0 million IPRD charge recognized upon consolidation of the Knopp variable interest entity to the noncontrolling interest. This decrease was partially offset by the $25.0 million payment made to Cardiokine upon the termination of our license agreement and an attribution of earnings from our foreign joint ventures. For 2009 compared to 2008, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily consisted of the attribution of earnings from our foreign joint ventures, which were relatively consistent in each year. Market Risk We conduct business globally. As a result, our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks which may affect our results of operations, including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign market in which we operate. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. While the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in ways that are difficult to predict. For example, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currencies decreases, conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the relative amount of such sales in U.S. dollars increases. Our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of our foreign currency hedging program. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact on volatility in exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk with the majority of our forward contracts used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations are recognized in the period in which we incur those gains or losses. Pricing Pressure We operate in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. Many countries are reducing their public expenditures in light of the global economic downturn and the deterioration of the credit and economic conditions in certain countries in Europe. As a result, we expect to see continued efforts to reduce healthcare costs, particularly in certain of the international markets in which we operate. The implementation of pricing actions varies by country and certain measures already implemented, which include among other things, mandatory price reductions and suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals, have negatively impacted our revenues. In addition, certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may also impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets. We expect that our revenues and results of operations will be further negatively impacted if these, similar or more extensive measures are, or continue to be, implemented in other countries in which we operate. 54 Table of Contents Credit Risk We are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the U.S. and Europe with concentrations of credit risk generally limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. Our accounts receivable are primarily due from wholesale distributors, large pharmaceutical companies and public hospitals. We monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. We operate in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. We continue to monitor these conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies and associated impacts on the relevant financial markets and our business. Our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not been significant. Within the European Union, our product sales in Italy, Spain and Portugal continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. The credit and economic conditions within these countries have continued to deteriorate throughout 2010. These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries. As of December 31, 2010, our accounts receivable balances in Italy, Spain and Portugal totaled $118.0 million, $100.6 million and $23.3 million, respectively, totaling approximately $241.9 million. Approximately $45.0 million of this amount was outstanding for greater than one year. As of December 31, 2010, we had $50.1 million of receivables that are expected to be collected beyond one year, which are included as a component of investments and other assets within our consolidated balance sheet. Our concentrations of credit risk related to our accounts receivable from product sales in Greece to date have been limited as our receivables within this market are due from our wholesale distributor, for which related accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2010, remain current and substantially in compliance with their contractual due dates. As of December 31, 2010 our accounts receivable balances due from our distributor in Greece totaled $3.9 million. However, the majority of our sales by our distributor are to government funded hospitals and as a result our distributor maintains significant outstanding receivables with the government of Greece. Furthermore, the government of Greece has recently required financial support from both the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to avoid defaulting on its debt. In the event that Greece defaults on its debt, and could not pay our distributor, we may be unable to collect some or all of our remaining amounts due from the distributor. The government of Greece may also require pharmaceutical creditors to accept mandatory, retroactive, price deductions in settlement of outstanding receivables and we could be required to repay our distributor a portion of the amounts they have previously remitted to us. The potential impact resulting from such mandatory actions remains uncertain, although delays or changes in the availability of government funding may adversely impact the operations of our distributor. To date, we have not been required to repay such amounts to our distributor or take a discount in settlement of any outstanding receivables and do not intend to do so. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of December 31, 2010; however, if significant changes occur in the availability of government funding or the reimbursement practices of these or other governments, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from customers in such countries and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 55 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial condition is summarized as follows: % Change 2010 As of December 31, Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 to 2009 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 759.6 $ 581.9 30.5 % Marketable securities current 448.1 681.8 (34.3 )% Marketable securities non current 743.1 1,194.1 (37.8 )% Total financial assets $ 1,950.8 $ 2,457.8 (20.6 )% Borrowings: Current portion of notes payable, line of credit and other financing arrangements $ 137.2 $ 19.8 594.0 % Notes payable and line of credit 1,066.4 1,080.2 (1.3 )% Total borrowings $ 1,203.5 $ 1,100.0 9.4 % Total working capital $ 1,490.3 $ 1,765.7 (15.7 )% For the year ended December 31, 2010, certain significant cash flows were as follows: $2,077.6 million used for share repurchases; $680.3 million in net proceeds received on sales and maturities of marketable securities; $352.0 million in total payments for domestic income taxes; $183.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock for share based compensation arrangements; $173.1 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment; $127.0 million in proceeds, net of transaction costs, received from sale of the San Diego facility, which has been accounted for as a financing arrangement; $26.4 million in upfront payments to Knopp under our license agreement dated August 17, 2010 and a $60.0 million investment in the equity of Knopp; $40.0 million payment made to the former shareholders of Syntonix recognized as IPRD expense; $32.5 million payment made for the acquisition of Panima; $30.0 million milestone payment made to Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp (formerly Facet Biotech Corporation) recognized as research and development expense; and $25.0 million termination payment made to Cardiokine recognized as a distribution to a noncontrolling interest. For the year ended December 31, 2009, certain significant cash flows were as follows: $696.3 million in total payments for domestic income taxes; $229.1 million used for net purchases of marketable securities; $165.6 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment. $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda on July 1, 2009; $751.2 million used for share repurchases; and $47.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock for share based compensation arrangements. 56 Table of Contents We have historically financed our operating and capital expenditures primarily through positive cash flows earned through our operations. We expect to continue funding our current and planned operating requirements principally through our cash flows from operations, as well as our existing cash resources. We believe that existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic alliance, milestone payment, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition and licensing activities. We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity. We consider the unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the U.S. Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2010, approximately $0.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. In managing our day to day liquidity in the U.S., we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds and we have not provided for U.S. federal or state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings. For additional information related to certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations, please read the Risk Factors and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk sections of this report. Share Repurchase Programs In April 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, with the objective of reducing shares outstanding and returning excess cash to shareholders. This repurchase authorization was completed during the third quarter of 2010. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 29.8 million shares of our common stock under this authorization. All shares repurchased under this program were retired. In October 2009, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock with the objective of reducing shares outstanding and returning excess cash to shareholders. This repurchase program was completed during the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of 2010, approximately 10.5 million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately $577.6 million under this authorization. During 2009, approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately $422.4 million under this authorization. All shares repurchased under this program were retired. In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. This repurchase program was completed during the fourth quarter of 2009. During 2009, approximately 7.2 million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately $328.8 million under this authorization. During 2008, approximately 12.8 million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately $738.9 million under this authorization. We used the 2006 share repurchase program principally for share stabilization. As a result of the approximately 40.3 million shares repurchased during 2010, common shares outstanding have decreased by approximately 15% since December 31, 2009. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Until required for another use in our business, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. and foreign government instruments and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. We mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well diversified portfolio that limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity, and investment type. The value of our investments, however, may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the credit rating of the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio, and by other factors which may result in declines in the value of the investments. Each of these events may cause us to 57 Table of Contents record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio if the declines are other than temporary or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost which could adversely impact our financial position and our overall liquidity. For a summary of the fair value and valuation methods of our marketable securities please read Note 7, Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. The decrease in cash and marketable securities from December 31, 2009, was primarily due to the execution of our share repurchases programs, tax payments, purchases of property, plant and equipment, the $32.5 million paid upon the acquisition of Panima, and the $86.4 million in payments made to Knopp under our recent license and stock purchase agreements, along with other milestone payments. These uses of cash were offset by cash generated from operations, net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net proceeds recorded from the sale of the San Diego facility and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our share based compensation arrangements. Borrowings We have a $360.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we may choose to use for future working capital and general corporate purposes. The terms of this revolving credit facility include various covenants, including financial covenants that require us to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and, under certain circumstances, an interest coverage ratio. This facility terminates in June 2012. No borrowings have been made under this credit facility and as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. In connection with our 2006 distribution agreement with Fumedica, we issued notes totaling 61.4 million Swiss Francs which were payable to Fumedica in varying amounts from June 2008 through June 2018. In June 2010, we repaid 12.0 million Swiss Francs ($10.3 million) of the outstanding amount. As of December 30, 2010, our remaining note payable to Fumedica has a present value of 20.7 million Swiss Francs ($22.0 million) and remains payable in a series of payments through June 2018. The notes are non interest bearing, have been discounted for financial statement presentation purposes, and are being accreted at an annual rate of 5.75%. As described in Note 10 Property, Plant Equipment, on October 1, 2010, we sold the San Diego facility and agreed to lease back the facility for a period of 15 months. Because we do not qualify for immediate sales treatment due to our continuing involvement with the facility, we have accounted for these transactions as a financing arrangement and recorded an obligation of $127.0 million on that date reflecting cash proceeds received, net of transaction costs. As of December 31, 2010, our remaining obligation was $125.9 million, which is reflected as a component of current portion of notes payable, line of credit and other financing arrangements within our consolidated balance sheet. There have been no other significant changes in our borrowings since December 31, 2009. For a summary of the fair and carrying value of our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, please read Note 7, Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Working Capital We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. The decrease in working capital from December 31, 2009, primarily reflects the overall increase in total current liabilities by $335.2 million. The increase in total current liabilities reflects increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by the June 2010 repayment of certain Fumedica notes payable as described above under Borrowings. The increase in accrued expenses is inclusive of an increase in the current portion of our Medicaid and VA accruals and accruals related to the restructuring activities we under took in the fourth quarter of 2010 and higher employee compensation accruals. 58 Table of Contents Cash Flows Our net cash flows are summarized as follows: % Change 2010 2009 For the Years Ended December 31, Compared Compared (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 to 2009 to 2008 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,624.7 $ 1,074.9 $ 1,562.4 51.1 % (31.2 )% Net cash flows used in investing activities $ 345.3 $ (395.0 ) $ (365.9 ) (187.4 %) 8.0 % Net cash flows used in financing activities $ (1,784.9 ) $ (724.2 ) $ (1,234.6 ) 146.5 % (41.3 )% Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by our earnings and changes in working capital. We expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for: Non cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and share based compensation charges; Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations; and Changes associated with the payment of contingent milestones associated with our prior acquisitions of businesses. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increased revenues and lower payments for U.S. federal income taxes offset by an increase in accounts receivable and receivables due from unconsolidated joint business. For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by changes in other liabilities and taxes payable, primarily due to an increase in income tax payments of $373.4 million which primarily resulted from increased earnings and the resolution of a number of audits in 2009, the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda on July 1, 2009 and the payment of certain accrued expenses and other current liabilities. On November 3, 2010, we announced a restructuring plan that involves a workforce reduction and the consolidation of facilities. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we began to record restructuring charges and currently expect to incur total pre tax costs through the fourth quarter of 2011 totaling approximately $110.0 million. The majority of the cash expenditures associated with these charges will be paid in the first half of 2011 and we expect that substantially all payments will be made by the end of 2011. Investing Activities For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by the $86.4 million in payments made to Knopp under our recent license and stock purchase agreements, the $32.5 million payment made upon our acquisition of Panima, our purchases of property, plant and equipment and the milestone payment made to the former shareholders of Syntonix. Net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities in 2010 totaled $680.3 million compared to net purchases of $229.1 million made in 2009. For 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in collateral received under our securities lending program and an increase in net purchases of marketable securities and strategic and other investments offset by a reduction in purchases of property, plant and equipment and the 2008 milestone payment made to the former shareholders of Conforma Therapeutics, Inc. The decline in purchases 59 Table of Contents of property, plant and equipment was primarily attributable to our Hillerd, Denmark manufacturing facility and certain other manufacturing upgrades. Financing Activities For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increases in the amounts of our common stock repurchased compared to the same period in 2009. In 2010, we repurchased approximately 40.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $2.1 billion compared to 16.0 million shares for approximately $751.2 million in 2009. Cash used in financing activities also includes the $127.0 in net proceeds from the sale of the San Diego facility, which is being accounted for as a financing arrangement and activity under our employee stock plans. We received $183.5 million in 2010 compared to $47.8 million in 2009 related to stock option exercises and stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan. For 2009 compared to 2008, the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of our term loan facility of $1.5 billion in 2008 and a decrease in obligations under our securities lending program offset in part by the net proceeds of $987.0 million from the issuance of long term debt and a decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of stock under our share based compensation programs. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, excluding amounts related to uncertain tax positions, amounts payable to tax authorities, funding commitments, contingent milestone payments, our financing arrangement related to the San Diego facility, and restructuring accruals, as described below. Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 4 to 5 After (In millions) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Non cancellable operating leases(1) $ 367.8 $ 40.9 $ 63.7 $ 57.6 $ 205.6 Notes payable and line of credit(2) 1,359.7 76.2 563.2 81.1 639.2 Purchase and other obligations(3) 69.6 52.1 14.8 2.4 0.3 Defined benefit obligation 8.2 8.2 Total contractual obligations $ 1,805.3 $ 169.2 $ 641.7 $ 141.1 $ 853.3 (1) We lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. Amounts reflected within the table, detail future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases as of December 31 for each of the years presented. (2) Notes payable and line of credit includes principal and interest payments. (3) Purchase and other obligations include our obligations of approximately $12.2 million related to the fair value of net liabilities on derivative contracts due in less than one year, approximately $4.5 million related to fixed obligations for the purchase of natural gas and approximately $16.8 million related to obligations for communication services Restructuring In connection with our recent restructuring initiative, we are in the process of vacating the San Diego, California facility and consolidating our Massachusetts facilities. Costs associated with closing these facilities, including costs related to the termination of certain leases, are reflected within our consolidated statement of income as a component of total restructuring charges incurred. For a more detailed description of our restructuring efforts, including our plan to consolidate facilities, please read Note 3, Restructuring to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 60 Table of Contents Financing Arrangement As described in Note 10 Property, Plant Equipment to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, on October 1, 2010, we sold the San Diego facility and agreed to lease back the facility for a period of 15 months. We have accounted for these transactions as a financing arrangement and recorded an obligation of $127.0 million on that date. As of December 31, 2010, our remaining obligation was $125.9 million, which is reflected as a component of current portion of notes payable, line of credit and other financing arrangements within our consolidated balance sheet. In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to terminate our 15 month lease of the San Diego facility. Under the terms of this agreement, we will continue to make monthly rental payments through August 31, 2011 and will have no continuing involvement or remaining obligation after that date. Once the lease arrangement has concluded we will account for the San Diego facility as a sale of property and we do not expect to recognize a significant gain or loss on the sale at that time. We are scheduled to incur debt service payments and interest totaling approximately $6.9 million over the term of the revised leaseback period. Tax Related Obligations We exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $137.7 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. Included in these liabilities are amounts related to the settlement of certain federal and state tax audits in the fourth quarter of 2009. As of December 31, 2010, we expect to pay approximately $76.1 million within the next twelve months in connection with such settlements. Other Funding Commitments As of December 31, 2010, we have funding commitments of up to approximately $19.0 million as part of our investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds. As of December 31, 2010, we have several ongoing clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations (CROs). The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We have recorded accrued expenses of $16.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet for expenditures incurred by CROs as of December 31, 2010. We have approximately $326.9 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts as of December 31, 2010 which are not included in the contractual obligations table above because of our termination rights. Contingent Milestone Payments Based on our development plans as of December 31, 2010, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $1,334.3 million as part of our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of December 31, 2010, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. We anticipate that we may pay approximately $55.6 million of milestone payments in 2011, provided various development, regulatory or commercial milestones are achieved. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not included in the contractual obligations table above as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones. These milestones may not be achieved. Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary. 61 Table of Contents Legal Matters For a discussion of legal matters as of December 31, 2010, please read Note 20, Litigation to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the most complex judgments result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and are significant to our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant areas involving estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows: Revenue recognition and related allowances; Collaborative relationships; Clinical trial expenses; Consolidation of variable interest entities; Valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination; Valuation of acquired intangible assets, including in process research and development; Inventory; Impairment and amortization of long lived assets and accounting for goodwill; Investments, including fair value measures and impairments; Share based compensation; Income taxes; Contingencies; and Restructuring charges. Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. Product Revenues Revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery. However, sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. are recognized on the sell through model, that is, upon shipment of the product by Elan to its third party distributor rather than upon shipment to Elan. The timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings. Reserves for Discounts and Allowances We establish reserves for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration and PHS discounts, managed care rebates, product returns and other applicable allowances. These reserves 62 Table of Contents are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. The estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition. In addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management and distribution services. We have established the fair value of these services and classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense. If we had concluded that we did not receive a separate identifiable benefit or have sufficient evidence that the fair value did not exist for these services, we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue. Healthcare Reform In 2010, healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the U.S. This legislation contains several provisions that affect our accounting estimates. Although many provisions of the new legislation did not take effect immediately, several provisions became effective in 2010. These include (1) an increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate to states participating in the Medicaid program from 15.1% to 23.1% on our branded prescription drugs; (2) the extension of the Medicaid rebate to Managed Care Organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries; and (3) the expansion of the 340B PHS drug pricing program, which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates, to include additional hospitals, clinics, and healthcare centers. These incremental discounts have been factored into determining the amount and timing of our revenues on sales to certain customers and are based upon several assumptions about the implementation of this new legislation. Our estimates are based upon our knowledge of current events and actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. Revenues from Unconsolidated Joint Business We collaborate with Genentech on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of (1) our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S.; (2) reimbursement of our selling and development expense in the U.S.; and (3) revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world, which consists of our share of pretax co promotion profits in Canada and royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and Canada by F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd. (Roche) and its sublicensees. Pre tax co promotion profits are calculated and paid to us by Genentech in the U.S. and by Roche in Canada. Pre tax co promotion profits consist of U.S. and Canadian sales of RITUXAN to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing, and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech, Roche and us. We record our share of the pretax co promotion profits in Canada and royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a cash basis. Additionally, our share of the pretax co promotion profits in the U.S. includes estimates supplied by Genentech. Actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates. Bad Debt Reserves Bad debt reserves are based on our estimated uncollectible accounts receivable. Given our historical experiences with bad debts, combined with our credit management policies and practices, we do not presently maintain significant bad debt reserves. Concentrations of Credit Risk The majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the United States and Europe and are primarily due from wholesale distributors, large pharmaceutical companies and public hospitals. We monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. We continue to monitor economic conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies, and associated impacts on the relevant financial markets and our business, especially in light of the global economic downturn. The credit and economic conditions within Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece among other members of the European Union have deteriorated throughout 2010. These conditions have resulted in, 63 Table of Contents and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries. As of December 31, 2010, our accounts receivable balances in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, were $118.0 million, $100.6 million, $23.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively, totaling approximately $245.8 million. Approximately $45.0 million of these amounts were outstanding for greater than one year, none of which related to our Greek distributor. As of December 31, 2010, we had $50.1 million of receivables that are expected to be collected beyond one year, which are included as a component of investments and other assets within our consolidated balance sheet. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. If economic conditions worsen and or the financial condition of our customers were to further deteriorate, our risk of collectability may increase, which may result in additional allowances and or significant bad debts. Royalty Revenues We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we own rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of these licensed products. There are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties that have been paid to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to assess the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are adjusted for in the period in which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material when compared to actual amounts paid by licensees. To the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate revenues; we record such revenues on a cash basis. Collaborative Relationships We evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper income statement classification based on the nature of the underlying activity. Amounts due from our collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to our operations. For collaborations with commercialized products, if we are the principal we record revenue and the corresponding operating costs in their respective line items within our consolidated statements of income. If we are not the principal, we record operating costs as a reduction of revenue. As discussed within Note 19, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, Genentech incurs the majority of continuing development cost for RITUXAN. Expenses incurred by Genentech in the development of RITUXAN are not recorded as research and development expense, but rather reduce our share of co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue. Clinical Trial Expenses Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of site management, monitoring costs, and project management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CROs to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities We consolidate variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. For such consolidated entities where we own less than a 100% interest, we record noncontrolling interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the third party equity interests. 64 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which affected how we determined whether a variable interest or interests give us a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we consider a number of factors, including our ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entitys economic success, our contractual rights and responsibilities under the arrangement and the significance of the arrangement to each party. These considerations impact the way we account for our existing collaborative and joint venture relationships and may result in the future consolidation of companies or entities with which we have collaborative or other arrangements. Valuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business Combination For acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009, we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates and periods, updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones, or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period. Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets, including In Process Research and Development We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process research and development product candidates. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we generally engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting regulatory approvals; estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the IPRD analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. Prior to January 1, 2009, we measured acquired IPRD in a business combination at fair value and expensed it on acquisition date if that technology lacked an alternative future use, or capitalized it as an intangible asset if certain criteria were met; however, effective January 1, 2009, if we are purchasing a business, the acquired IPRD is measured at fair value, capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually until commercialization, after which time the IPRD is amortized over its estimated useful life. If we acquire an asset or group of assets, that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards; then the 65 Table of Contents acquired IPRD is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to expense as they are incurred if the technology lacks alternative future uses. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. Capitalization of Inventory Costs Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization. We are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. We expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of our inventory did not include any costs associated with products that had not yet received regulatory approval. There is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods. Obsolescence and Unmarketable Inventory We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. In the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we will record a charge to cost of sales to write down any obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. In all cases product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value. Impairment and Amortization of Long lived Assets and Accounting for Goodwill Long lived Assets Other than Goodwill Long lived assets to be held and used, including property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. 66 Table of Contents We also regularly evaluate our current manufacturing utilization strategy and assess alternatives. In June 2010, we decided to stop further validation of our large scale manufacturing facility in Hillerd, Denmark following completion of the facilitys operational qualification activities in the first half of 2011 as we continue to evaluate our current manufacturing utilization strategy. Recent manufacturing improvements have resulted in favorable production yields on TYSABRI, that along with slower than expected TYSABRI growth, have reduced our expected capacity requirements. As a result, we have decided to delay the start of manufacturing activities at this site until additional capacity is required by the business. If we decide to consolidate, co locate or dispose of certain aspects of our business operations, for strategic or other operational reasons, we may dispose of or vacate one or more of our properties. Our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our AVONEX product. We believe the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our AVONEX product, which we refer to as the economic consumption amortization model. This amortization methodology involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset. An analysis of the anticipated product sales of AVONEX is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle, and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model. Although we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset, the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances, due to continued sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise. In order to ensure that amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods, we compare the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model against the minimum amount of amortization recalculated each year under the straight line method. Amortization is then recorded based upon the higher of the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model or the minimum amortization amount determined under the straight line method. We completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of 2010. This analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis, such as the anticipated product sales of AVONEX and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates, as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents. Based upon this analysis, we have continued to amortize this asset on the economic consumption model for the third and fourth quarters of 2010, and expect to apply the same model for the next two quarters. In addition, this analysis did not result in a significant change in the expected lifetime revenue of AVONEX. If there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of AVONEX determined during our most recent annual review. For example, the occurrence of an adverse event, such as the invalidation of our AVONEX 755 Patent issued in September 2009, could substantially increase the amount of related amortization expense as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations. We did not recognize an impairment charge related to our long lived assets during 2010, 2009 and 2008. Goodwill Goodwill totaled approximately $1,146.3 million as of December 31, 2010, and relates largely to amounts that arose in connection with the merger of Biogen, Inc. and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Our goodwill balances represent the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. We assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. The provisions of this guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of our reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference. 67 Table of Contents We completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2010, 2009 and 2008 and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired. In each year, the fair value of our reporting unit, which includes goodwill, was significantly in excess of the carry value of our reporting unit. Investments, including Fair Value Measures and Impairments We invest in various types of securities, including: short term and long term marketable securities, principally corporate notes, government securities including government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities and credit card and auto loan asset backed securities, in which our excess cash balances are invested; equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies, some of which have collaborative agreements with us; equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available; and investments in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds where fair value is not readily available. In accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability. As noted in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, a majority of our financial assets and liabilities have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services. The pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. We validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming those securities trade in active markets. We also have some investments classified as Level 3 whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies. We apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties. While we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate, the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations. Impairment We conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income. For available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the securitys decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected within earnings as an impairment loss. Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are reflected within earnings as an impairment loss. 68 Table of Contents For equity securities, when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary, we consider the fair market value of the security, the duration of the securitys decline, and the financial condition of the issuer. We then consider our intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover our carrying value. Where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery, the securitys decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is reflected within earnings as an impairment loss. Share Based Compensation We make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense for our share based compensation arrangements. We review and evaluate our assumptions regularly and, as a result, we confirm or change the assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant increase or decrease in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments. In connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, we use the Black Scholes options pricing model, which requires us to develop certain subjective assumptions. The key assumptions that most significantly affect the calculation include the expected volatility of our stock, the expected term of the award and the expected forfeiture rate associated with our stock option plan. For each of our restricted stock programs, we make assumptions in accounting for these awards, principally related to the forfeiture rate. For our time vested and performance vested restricted stock awards, each period end, we also develop an estimate of each performance factor in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned. For our plan, the number of shares to be earned is based on company performance metrics, such as annual revenue and earnings per share. Thus, during the performance period, we estimate our full year revenue and earnings per share and then adjust the performance factor after the completion of the full year. In addition, beginning in 2010, we granted certain employees restricted stock units which will vest based on stock price performance, referred to as market stock units, as well as performance vested restricted stock units which will be settled in cash, rather than in shares, referred to as cash settled performance shares. These market stock units use a binomial model or Monte Carlo simulation to value each award at the grant date and include key assumptions such as the expected market price of our stock on the vest date and the expected number of shares to be vested under the terms of the award. The cash settled awards are marked to market at the end of each period, with fluctuations in value reported through earnings. Income Taxes We prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdictions tax laws and regulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that 69 Table of Contents include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2010, undistributed foreign earnings and other basic differences of non U.S. subsidiaries included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated approximately $2.4 billion. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the U.S.; however, if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs, the resultant tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable if such earnings were remitted to the U.S. Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Restructuring Charges We have made estimates and judgments regarding the amount and timing of our restructuring expense and liability, including current and future period termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when related actions take place. We have also assessed the recoverability of certain long lived assets employed in the business and in certain instances shortened the expected useful life of the assets based on changes in their expected use. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we record additional depreciation to reflect the assets new shorter useful lives. Severance and other related costs and asset related charges are reflected within our consolidated statement of income as a component of total restructuring charges incurred. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a more detailed description of our recent restructuring efforts, please read Note 3, Restructuring, to these consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Standards For a discussion of new accounting standards please read Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have operations or maintain distribution relationships in the U.S., Europe, Middle East, Canada, Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, India and elsewhere in Asia in connection with the sale of AVONEX and TYSABRI and in Germany in connection with the sale of FUMADERM. We also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through Genentech on sales of RITUXAN in the 70 Table of Contents rest of world. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Danish krone, Swedish krona, British pound, and Japanese yen. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation. The majority of our forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items. We have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items. The following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in both programs. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, a hypothetical adverse 10% movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities (for example, a strengthening of the Euro) would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately $65.5 million and $64.4 million, respectively. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions. Certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is, therefore, subject to changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point adverse movement (increase in LIBOR) would increase annual interest expense by approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. In addition, the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we estimate that such hypothetical adverse 100 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $10.5 million and $16.9 million, respectively, to our interest rate sensitive instruments. The returns from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change. A 100 basis point adverse movement (decrease) in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $11.4 million and $12.5 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. We regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $4.5 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
